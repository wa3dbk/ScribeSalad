00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.670
Heroin is a drug that is often abused for its powerful pain relieving effects,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.424
both physical and psychological, as well as the euphoria. However, tolerance

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:13.700
develops to the effects of heroin, and that requires the user to take more of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.060
the drug to produce those similar effects. In addition, once the heroin addict

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.260
is physically dependent When the drug starts to leave their system, they'll

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.291
experience withdrawal symptoms. Thus, the life of a heroin addict is a vicious

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:33.096
cycle, spent injecting the drug. Experiencing effects. And when that starts to

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:37.240
wear off, they're going to seek to find the drug again. Often times, this

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.080
resolves in criminal activity in an attempt to purchase the drug. Now, heroin

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.419
is not used here medically in the United States, but other powerful opiates

00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:50.686
are. However, although some people do abuse the opioids, it's important to

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:55.770
stress the value of these pain-relieving agents. From a medicinal point of

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.868
view, these are essential for managing individuals who experience pain. Now,

00:00:59.868 --> 00:01:04.422
the opiates produce their effects by interacting with our mu, delta, and kappa

00:01:04.422 --> 00:01:10.780
receptors and they act similar to our endogenous endorphins and enkephalins.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.372
People often die from overdosing on these drugs by respiratory depression. Now,

00:01:16.372 --> 00:01:18.866
I'm going to send it back to Lauren and we're going to discuss the next drug,

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:19.940
cannabis.
