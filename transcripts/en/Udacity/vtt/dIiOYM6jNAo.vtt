00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.151
The left-hand side of the equation is just y, and in place of y, we're

00:00:04.163 --> 00:00:08.553
substituting in the y-coordinate at this point, which is 7. So, the left-hand

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:13.701
side should just become 7. The right-hand side, as we can see over here, has an

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:18.360
x in it. So, we need to substitute 3 into that spot. Simplifying that all the

00:00:18.372 --> 00:00:23.361
way, gives us 4. Unfortunately, 7 is not equal to 4. In answer to the question,

00:00:23.472 --> 00:00:28.621
are the sides equal, we have to say no. Since plugging in the coordinates this

00:00:28.633 --> 00:00:33.708
point makes it so that the two side of our equation are no longer equal, which

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.844
we remember is the requirement of an equation, this point must not lay on this

00:00:38.856 --> 00:00:45.388
line. In other words, these values for x and y do not satisfy the equation, y

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.860
equals 3x minus 5.
