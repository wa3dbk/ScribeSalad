A /20 prefix is, 2 to the 4th, or 16/24th's.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.210
And I need to basically represent 16 entries, at the

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.820
24 bit level, of the trie or the second level.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.940
And therefore, I'd need 16 entries to represent, a /20 prefix.
