00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.930
Let's think about the first scenario.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.340
We know that we are recording our voice here in this first scene,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.630
or the record sounds view controller.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.190
But we will need that recorded file in here in the second scene, or

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.310
in the Play Sounds View Controller.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.770
We will definitely need to pass that audio file onto the second scene.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.240
Now if you look in the storyboard, we can see that these two scenes,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.690
they're connected to each other.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.765
This means that every time you press the stop button,

00:00:23.765 --> 00:00:25.650
we move on to the second scene.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.820
This doesn't really give us the opportunity to pass the audio file we

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.540
recorded in here,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.200
inside the Record Sounds View Controller to Play Sounds View Controller.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.650
To change this, I will select the Segue and then hit Delete on my keyboard.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.400
Now if I try to build a project, Xcode will complain that

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.630
the second scene is abandoned and that there is no way of reaching it.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.040
I can see that message right here, by clicking this triangle.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.230
It says that this scene is unreachable due to a lack of entry point.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.760
To fix this, I will connect two view controllers.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.730
I will select this first view controller, then press and

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.750
hold Ctrl on my keyboard, and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.100
start dragging from this View Controller to the second one, and then let go.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.010
Here I will select the option Show one more time.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.840
Now that these two are connected, I can invoke a function called performSegue(),

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.880
from somewhere inside my code to actually trigger this segue.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.510
And while I do that, I can pass the audio file from this view

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.320
controller to this view controller and I can do all of that from inside my code.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.860
I will do this exercise in the next few videos.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.610
For now, let me just select the segue and give it a name.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.160
I will slide out the utility area and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.950
under Attributes Inspector I will give this segue a name or an identifier.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.790
Let me call it stopRecording.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.630
All right.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.990
Let's go back out slides and tackle the second scenario.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.040
This situation talks about what would happen if we start to

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.550
play an audio conversation that has not been fully processed by the phone yet.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.980
To understand that, we need to understand something called Delegate in iOS.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.080
Now before we jump into what this means in iOS,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.000
I want you to think about what this word means in simple english.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.860
So here is the question one more time.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.380
What comes to mind when I say the word delegate.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.750
