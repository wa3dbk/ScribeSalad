00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Several statistics we can compute in a pretty straightforward way if the list L is sorted.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's imagine that these are list of values that we're concerned about and I put little

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
pointy things on it to say that this is now sorted from smallest to largest.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If this L is sorted the minimum value is sitting here in the very first position--so it's L(â‚€),

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the maximum is sitting all the way at the end here--L(n-â‚ ),

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
midpoint is just the average of those two--so we can look up the minimum, the maximum

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
add them together and divided by 2, and the median is just whoever is

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
sitting in the middle of this list once it's sorted.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In this case, all of these operations run in Î˜(1) constant time, given that the list is sorted.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Things like the mean or the mode aren't quite so straightforward to do on a sorted

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
list like this but these four we can do very, very quickly.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Just to practice this idea, here's little quiztistics. Here's a sorted list of two digit numbers.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I want you to find the midpoint and the median of this list

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and then tell me what's the mean of those two values.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You can write it in this box.
