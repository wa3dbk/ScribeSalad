00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.190
So let's talk about how to actually
create a surface with the Android STK.

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.850
So, as we said, a surface is essentially
a container which casts a shadow.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.600
We can identify which views in
our hierarchy are surfaces and

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.900
set appropriate backgrounds and
elevation values.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.610
So let's start with a simple example and

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.030
create a screen that contains
a single surface that casts a shadow.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.530
So here I am in Android Studio looking
at a simple activity layout file.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.800
I have a frame layout
which will be our surface.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.250
I can give it a height and
width and some margins and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.480
set its background here to white.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.440
To create a surface, the key thing is
I can set this elevation value here.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.900
Here I'm setting 4dp, and Android
will render that as a shadow for us.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.030
The elevation is the distance of
surfaces above the back plane.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.900
Higher values produce larger shadows.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.200
So here we are running this on a device.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.530
And as you can see,
our frame layout is casting a shadow

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.420
along the bottom edge onto
the background behind.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.360
This clearly shows that
it's a separate surface.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.310
Back in Android Studio, I can duplicate
our surface a couple of times,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.850
so the same frame layout.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.300
But here, I'm setting different
values for the elevation.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.510
So we have one set with 4 dp,
a second set is at 8 dp,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.440
and a third at 16 dp in
front of the back plane.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.030
Running this,

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.430
we see that Android renders these three
different surfaces of different shadows.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.740
So here's a subtle shadow, a little more
noticeable, and more noticeable still.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.620
The higher the elevation values produce
a larger more diffuse shadow giving

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.270
the appearance of being higher up or
further in front of the back plane.
