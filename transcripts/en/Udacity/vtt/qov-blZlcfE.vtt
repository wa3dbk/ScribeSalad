handle a situation that plays a large role in how our body reacts to a

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:11.946
stressful event. Now what may be stressful to one person may not be stressful

00:00:11.946 --> 00:00:16.894
to another. So two people can be exposed to the exact same virus and one person

00:00:16.894 --> 00:00:21.490
may get sick and one person may not. All because of how they perceive the

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.028
stress they are under. Now have you ever gotten sick when you were under a lot

00:00:25.028 --> 00:00:28.889
of stress? If so, what was that stressor?
