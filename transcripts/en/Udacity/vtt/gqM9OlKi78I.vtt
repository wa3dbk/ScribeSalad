00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.760
Finally, let us discuss in arrow B based out of order execution processor,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:10.030
what really is out of order here? So this is our processor pipeline, let's say,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.860
this is the fetch stage, there is a decode stage, we issue, then we dispatch and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.920
then we have execution, and then the right of the result which is

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.890
the broadcast we have and then finally the commit. So in this pipeline,

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.360
if this was an out of order processor, keep in mind that not all of these stages

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:33.510
are processing instructions out of order. In fact, from fetch up to issue,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.590
we are processing instructions in order. We have to fetch them in the order that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.200
they should appear in the program. We then decode them in the correct order, and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.390
we fetch them if you remember in order. This ensures that any dependencies we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.530
figure out here are the dependencies that are compatible with the original

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.810
program order. Now that, we have issued instructions to reservation stations and

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.340
they're waiting for execution, they're going to execute in,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.900
the order of data dependencies, not necessarily in program order. So

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.090
the execution and writing of results, are happening out of order. And then,

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.900
again, commit needs to do instructions in the proper program order because if

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.160
you remember the order of committing is really the order in

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.250
which we tell the outside world that we are finishing instructions. So,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.420
this has to happen in order to give the appearance that we're executing

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.860
instructions in program order. So, when we have an out of order processor,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.760
it really is going many stages in order and only the execution and broadcast and

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.600
things in between are happening out of order. So the dispatching, the execution,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.640
the, the writing of results, everything else is still in order. In contrast,

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.590
what we would call an in-order processor, just as these in order too.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.240
But even an out of order proser does a lot of things in order.
