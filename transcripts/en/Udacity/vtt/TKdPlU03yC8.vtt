00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.080
In this lesson, I hope to be able to cover aspects of how we can actually now

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.530
start looking at neighborhoods of pixels to help us do, among other things, like

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.230
smoothing of an image, to be able to extract more information from an image, or

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.760
just be able to enhance the image quality.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.800
The two things I want to be able to cover in this lecture is one,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.950
I'm going to talk about how we can smooth an image by using a neighborhood of

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.870
pixels on an image.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.850
And also I'm going to specifically talk about an application of this,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.450
which is using median filtering to be able to among other things,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.220
remove errors and smooth out an image.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.530
Median filtering will be another instance of a method where we would be

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.080
looking at a neighborhood and running a statistical process on that

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.760
neighborhood to create a, a newer rendition of an image.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.540
And again, this will go towards enhancing as how we can do filtering an image at

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.980
processing to be able to help us extract content from images.
