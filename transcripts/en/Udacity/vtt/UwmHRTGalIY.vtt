00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.090
In this video, I will walk you through
an implementation of token-based

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.020
authentication in Flask.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.730
There are several ways of implementing
this functionality in your code, but

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.050
this is one solution I have to be found
rather easy to understand and secure.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.510
I have a new models.pi file that
contains the user model and

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.710
the basic HTTP authorization
code from the previous exercise.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.190
Here I have a secret key, which is just
a random string of 32 characters that I

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.780
will use to sign my tokens.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.650
I will also make a new method
here called generate_auth_token.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.510
I will make the token be an encrypted
version of a dictionary that hides

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.020
the ID of the user.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.340
The token will also have
an expiration time embedded in it.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.380
Which by default,
will be of TEN mins or 600 seconds.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.290
The verification is implemented in
a verfy_auth_token static method.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.930
A static method is used because
the user will only be known

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.270
once the token is decoded.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.200
Now in my views.pi file,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.220
I'll make a new end point that
the client can use to request a token.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.150
Note that this inpoint is protected
with the auth.loginrequired decorator

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.300
from Flask HTTPI, which requires that
the user name and password are provided.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.760
Next I'll add code for handling
a token when my server receives one.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.000
The HTTP basic authentication protocol
does not specifically require that user

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.170
names and passwords are used for
authentication.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.370
These two fields in the HTTP
header can be used to transport

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.190
any type of authentication information.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.260
For token based authentication, the
token can be sent as a user name, and

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.610
the password field can be ignored.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.780
This means that now the server can
authenticate requests with the user name

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.030
and password.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.030
And request with just a token.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.450
The verified password callback needs
to support both authentication styles.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.260
This new version of the verified
password callback attempts

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.580
authentication twice, it first tries to
use the user name argument as a token.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.640
If that doesn't work, then user name and
password are verified as before.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.260
I will run my web server again and
send the following kernel request.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.280
In order to get an authentication token,
I will run my web server again, and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.240
send the following kernel request,
in order to get an authentication token.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.110
Now the protected resource can be
obtained authenticating with the token.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.430
Note that in this last request, the
password is written as the word blank.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.970
The password in this request can
be anything, since it isn't used.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.820
the code, end request,
can be found in the instructor notes.
