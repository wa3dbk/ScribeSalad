00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.532
And the answer is a search with an up arrow constrains the pattern to match right at the beginning.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.266
So that's the same as just doing a match with the rest of the pattern.

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:15.399
And the rest of the pattern is just the pattern from position one, onward.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.266
Now, if the pattern doesn't start with an up arrow and we're doing a search,

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:22.799
that means the search could be anywhere within the text.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.732
But that's the same as asking for a pattern that has any number of characters at the beginning,

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:39.667
match of any character any number of times, and that's the same as adding a dot star to the start of the pattern.
