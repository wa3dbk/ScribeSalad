00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.025
Next we turn to the page fault and ask the

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.580
question: What happens when an application requests a virtual address

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.185
that's not mapped to physical memory, but is somewhere on

00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:11.980
disk? I'll represent a user's process like so and at

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.800
some point, he uses a virtual memory address that's not

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.870
actually mapped to physical memory at the moment. Yikes! Actually

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.530
it's not that big a deal. An exception is raised,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.620
which sets the running process back to be ready to repeat

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.400
the instruction that created the, the fault. Meanwhile,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240
the operating systems page fault handler takes over to

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.129
address the problem. He checks to make sure the

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.843
request is actually valid and sends, sends a segfault

00:00:37.843 --> 00:00:40.440
if it isn't. Then he loads the desired page

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.170
into memory, gets everything ready and then tells the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.390
scheduler that the process is ready to resume. The

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.240
process will execute its memory move or read or

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.810
whatever it is again, and this time it will succeed because

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.800
the page has been loaded into memory and it can continue

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.130
running. That's the high-level picture. Let's talk a little bit more

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.440
about what the page fault handler does. So assuming that the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.230
page we want really does reside on disk, the first thing

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
the page handler does is to find a physical page frame

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.670
in memory to load the data into. The best scenario is

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.350
that one is free. The handler keeps a list of free pages.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.050
If this is not empty, then he can just pop one off.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.660
Okay? And that makes us very happy. If he doesn't have a

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.900
free page, however, then he must choose a page for replacement. There

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.760
are many possible page replacement algorithms. We won't go into them here.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.770
For our purposes, it suffices to say that a page handler will

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.240
pick a page that it doesn't think is likely to be used

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.110
soon. This page is saved to disk and then its physical memory

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.250
can store the page that was created by the page fault. So,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.830
one way or another, we now have a free physical page in memory to which

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.910
we can write the data we need from disk. Then we update the process's page

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.860
table and any other data structures that

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.920
are page fault handler needs to keep track

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.300
of and then we're ready to restart the process and let it continue on to a
