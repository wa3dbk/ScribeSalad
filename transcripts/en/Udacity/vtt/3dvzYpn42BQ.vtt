00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Social networks are just graphs like the kinds of graphs we've been studying.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
But the real world networks that you actually find have some distinctive properties.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And these have been documented by researchers like Duncan Watts and others.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One property of these graphs is that they tend to exhibit the small world phenomenon,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which essentially means that there are short paths between arbitrary nodes in the graph.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Another is that they're cliqueish, which means they exhibit a high clustering coefficient.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I'm going to illustrate these two properties next.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So this is me essentially. I live in Bernardsville, NJ.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is Chris M. He lives in Wellesley, MA and he's very tall.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Finally, this is Chris S. and I'm not sure exactly where he lives

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but I'm going to say New Brunswick, NJ.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So last summer, Chris S. and Chris M. were both at the New Jersey Shore at the same time

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and they got together for drinks.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Chris S. told Chris M. that he worked at Rutgers University.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And Chris M. said, "Oh! Do you know Michael Littman?"

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And Chris S. said, "Actually yes. Small world!"

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So it turned out that Chris S. was connected to me.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We both worked at Rutgers and had worked on a project together.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And Chris Metcalf and I went to the same undergraduate institution,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and we're friends doing computer sciencey stuff.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And here are these two random people meeting in some far away place hundreds of miles away

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
from where they live and they had this connection between them

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and what we say when this sort of thing happens is it's sort of a small world.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Even though there's lot people in lots of places, people are not as foreign to us as we might think.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So the classic example of this kind of effect was from the experiment by Stanley Milgram.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
He very coarsely estimated that any person in the US was just 5 or 6 steps away from any other,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and this gave rise to what we now think of as being the idea of 6 degrees of separation.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In graph theoretic terms, what we say is that a graph exhibits the small world phenomenon

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
if nodes have relatively small degree but also a relatively short path to other arbitrary nodes,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and social network seem to exhibit exactly this property.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So just to get you thinking about the degree of different graphs and the path links

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in different graphs, here's four different kinds of graphs we've talked about before.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Clique where all the nodes are connected to each other.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
A ring where the nodes are connected into a ring.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
A balance tree where you have a tree structure, but there's a node that kind of separates

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the other nodes into these two different components that are about the same size.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And a hypercube like this three-dimensional hypercube.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And what I'd like you to do is think about in an N node version of that graph what is the degree

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and what is the path length between sort of the longest path link in the graph

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
as a function of the number of nodes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Is it constant? Does it depend on the number of nodes in the graph?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Is it logarithmic? Or is it linear?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So a graph that has a low degree might be of 1 or log n,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and if it has short paths it might be of 1 or log n.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So which properties do these graphs exhibit?
