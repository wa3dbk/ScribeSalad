00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.510
Now that you've seen a lot of code for implementing methods. Let me show you a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.510
technique that can help you understand what a method implementation does. It's

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.635
called the object tracing technique. So, let's say that you have a, a couple of

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:15.570
methods that do some work that may not be so easy to understand. Here's what

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.480
you do. Pick some scenario, that exercises these methods. Like here, I'm making

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.220
a car, I add gas, I drive it, and I drive it a bit more. And now we want to

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.580
understand, what do these methods calls do to the car. It's very low tech. Get

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.189
yourself an index card or a napkin or some other piece of paper. Make a column

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.420
for each instance variable. So, let's get started. I put the paper clip so we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.400
can see where we are. We construct a car, that initialized the instance

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.830
variables. I didn't have room to put in the code for the constructor but

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.092
hopefully you remember. The gas and tank and miles driven are initialized to

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:51.150
zero. The miles per gallon with the parameter of the constructor. Let's move

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.780
on. Now we enter the add gas method here. Amount is thirty. Gas in tank is

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.710
zero. So, the effective set gas in tank is set to thirty. Moving on. Now we

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.200
drive ten miles. So, distance is ten. And since this method is a bit longer and

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.800
it has another local variable here, it makes sense to make another card for it.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.590
Or actually, since I ran out of simulated cards, I'll use a napkin. So the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.223
distance parameter is 10, over here. We update miles driven, previously it was

00:01:20.223 --> 00:01:24.670
0. We add 10. That's now 10. Now here we compute the gas consumed. That's

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.210
another local variable. I'll put it on my napkin. It's the distance divided by

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.890
miles per gallon. 10 divided by 10. So, we consumed a gallon. Now we can look

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.930
at this statement here. Gas in tank was 30. Gas consumed was 1. The difference

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.510
is 29. So, that should now by moved into gas in tank. Now, we're at the end of

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.740
this method call, and the local variable here and the parameter variable go

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.110
away. So, we can just crumple up our napkin here. These variables are no longer

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.705
there once we exited this method. Of course, the instance variables, the

00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:00.380
long-term memory of the object, they stay around. Now here we are on the next

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.390
method call, we're calling the drive method again. That means that this local

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.930
variable, and this one here, will get recreated. Of course this time the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.230
distance is 20. Now let's see, miles driven is, miles driven plus distance.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.105
Previously it was 10. Now we have 20, now it becomes 30. Gas consumed is

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:24.890
distance over miles driven, that's 20 by 10 or two. Gas in tank was 29 minus

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.960
two is 27. So, now we've executed the three steps in this method. This method

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.740
is now finished. And once again, the local variables go away. And we're done,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.260
and this is the remaining state of the object. What's the point? By doing this

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.990
exercise, you gain an understanding of what the statements in the methods do to

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.680
the instance variables of an object. Sarah will walk you through an example on

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.600
how you can use this technique to find a bug in a method implementation.
