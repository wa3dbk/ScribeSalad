00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.670
iOS also has several other
run time security measures.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.010
Address space layout randomization or

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.380
ASLR protects against exploitation
of memory corruption bugs.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.700
With ASLR, when an app is run,
all memory regions are randomized.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.650
Randomly arranging the memory addresses
of executable code system libraries,

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.590
stacks, and heaps, and
other related programming contracts,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.480
reduces the likelihood of
many sophisticated exploits.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.060
For example, an attempted Lib C
attack attempts to trick a device

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.080
into executing malicious code,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.260
by manipulating memory addresses
of the stack and system libraries.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.430
By randomizing the addresses of
these system libraries and stacks,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.680
it will be hard for
such an attack to succeed, because

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.020
the addresses of these system libraries
and stacks are very hard to guess.
