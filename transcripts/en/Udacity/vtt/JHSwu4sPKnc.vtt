00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.110
So if we look at this, it's actually the case that n vans splitting up the work.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.590
We'll take quite a bit less time from when they need to deliver the mail to when they get back to base.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.990
Now, there might be some cases where it doesn't actually help out too much.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.190
For example, if you have a graph where it's just a straight line

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.220
well then all the n vans are going to go here and here and here and here,

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.920
and then dot, dot, dot, dot,--well, you haven't really save any time.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.900
However, if you have instead a graph like this, well then, you can have four vans

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.470
each go out on one of the arms and come back to base instead of having a single van

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.160
that would have to go here and come back and here and back,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.370
and here and back, and here and back.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.420
That's quite a bit more time.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.930
You don't want to have to do that and that's why you used more vans and it turns out

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.190
that the time delivered the mail and return is always going to be less than or equal to

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.460
depending on the actual case.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.260
Now, how bout the sum of time taken by the vans.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.830
This is going to be at least as much as and maybe more.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.740
To see this, let's actually take a look at those same two problems.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.490
In this case, it takes an hour to leave base and go along the road

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.050
to where you're delivering the mail and then an hour to come back.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.190
This is a very long delivery route.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.240
Then if you have four vans then the time taken is two hours for each van

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.580
which would be eight hours which in this case is actually the same.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.640
Now, the other case where you have to go along here.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.860
Now let's say if you have four vans then, well, neither van come up here and then go back.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.650
Neither van to come up here and go back and then come up here and go back

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.090
and then come up here and go back, that's actually the quickest you can do it

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.550
while still utilizing all four vans.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.870
In that case, you're taking two hours there, four hours there, six hours there, and eight hours there.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:17.470
Instead if one man, he will just take one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight total.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.490
So the actual total time taken is quite a bit larger in this case.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.100
So, it really depends on what you all want to optimize.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.710
Generally, the time that it takes to deliver all the mail is probably more important

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.980
to most people than the sum of the individual driver's time

00:02:34.980 --> 99:59:59.000
and it's really a trade off which is one is better here.
