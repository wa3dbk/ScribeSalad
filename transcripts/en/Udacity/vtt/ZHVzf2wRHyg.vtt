00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.132
So you know how to solve for a variable using numbers. First we multiplied those

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:10.636
sides by the quantity 5 plus y, we distributed the positive 3 here, and then we

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:15.582
subtracted 15 and divided by 3. But what if we had an equation like this one and

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:19.814
we wanted to solve for y? Notice the setup of these two equations are nearly

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:24.574
identical. It turns out that we can solve for y by following nearly the same

00:00:24.574 --> 00:00:29.435
exact steps here. Instead of using numbers, though, we'll have variables. First

00:00:29.435 --> 00:00:35.350
we'll multiply each side of our equations by x plus y. Then we'll distribute z

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.300
to both of these terms, to get zx plus zy equals one x. When we're at this step,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.445
we want to isolate y. Remember we wanted to solve for y or this variable and get

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.966
it by itself. So we should isolate this on one side of the equation by

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:57.473
subtracting zx from both sides. We'll get zy is equal to x minus z times x.

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:01.490
These are not like terms so we can't combine them. The variables are different.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.777
And finally to isolate y we divide both sides by z. This gives us with one y

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:12.810
equal to x minus z times x all divided by z. This is pretty amazing, we actually

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.827
solved an equation for a variable in terms of other variables. So, in this work

00:01:18.827 --> 00:01:24.097
we really multiplied by x plus y first Then we distributed the positive z to

00:01:24.097 --> 00:01:29.516
each of these terms. Next we subtracted zx from both sides of our equation to

00:01:29.516 --> 00:01:34.378
get the y alone on one side. And to solve for y, or to get one y, we divided by

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:38.974
z, which gave us our final answer. See if you can look back at this work and

00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:44.350
this work, to draw comparisons between the two. They're not that much different.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.366
We're really just trying to get 1 variable solved in terms of others. When

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:54.182
you're doing the comparison, think about z as being 3. And think about x as

00:01:54.182 --> 00:01:58.560
being 5. This is a skill that might come in handy with other courses. Especially

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.016
when you're trying to solve for certain variables. Maybe you don't want to find

00:02:02.016 --> 00:02:07.682
this variable, z. Maybe you want to find x or y. These 2 equations are actually

00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:12.306
the same. They just look different. This equation and this equation are actually

00:02:12.306 --> 00:02:16.438
equivalent. They just look different in from. This one is solve for z, and this

00:02:16.438 --> 00:02:21.549
one is solve for y. If I knew the values of x and y, I could quickly compute the

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.211
value of z. But, maybe, instead, I really want to find the value of y. If I know

00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:31.274
the values of x and z, I can quickly find the value of y by plugging into this

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:32.053
equation.
