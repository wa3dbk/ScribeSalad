So I'm going to discuss B.F Skinner's theory of Verbal Behavior and how we

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.230
acquire language. And you'll see that adults do much to encourage imitation

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.435
from children. And one way they do so is through what's called child directed

00:00:12.435 --> 00:00:16.024
speech. You saw an example of child directed speech in the lesson on

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.944
development when we had the quiz. I was engaging in child-directed speech, and

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:24.656
I did so by raising my voice a higher pitch, I talked in smaller sentences, and

00:00:24.656 --> 00:00:29.529
I used lots of emotion. Oh, aren't you a cute little baby?
