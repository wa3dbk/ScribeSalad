00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My next question pertains to the tracking problem that we talked about in class.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In class we addressed a 1-dimensional tracking problem where we estimated the location of the system and its velocity.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'd like now to generalize this to a 2-dimensional problem.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll be given coordinants x and y,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and the object we're tracking moves in 2-dimensional space,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we wish to use a Kalman filter to understand where the object is, what its velocity is,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and even be able to predict a future location based on the estimate of the position and its velocity.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So the only difference, class, is that our object now moves in a 2-dimensional space,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
where as in class, it moved in a 1-dimensional space.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So my first question is what's the dimension of the state vector in the Kalman filter? [Dimension of the state vector?]

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In the class, it was this kind of state vector. Now, we have a new one.

00:00:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
How many dimensions or how many variables are there?
