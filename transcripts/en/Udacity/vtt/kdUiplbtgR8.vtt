00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.139
Negative 7 5ths and 2 are the correct answers. Amazing work. You got this one

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:10.241
correct. When we start solving this problem, we want them multiplied by the LCD

00:00:10.241 --> 00:00:15.448
which is x times x plus 1. It's the product of these two denominators. We cancel

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:20.063
the factors that reduce to 1 and then we distribute the remaining factors here

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:26.317
on x terms. So we'll have 5x times x plus 1 Plus 6 times x, which equals 14

00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:31.884
times x plus 1. Next, we distribute the 5x and the 14 to get our new equation. I

00:00:31.884 --> 00:00:36.912
have a quadratic term here, so I know I need to factor. I'm going to move these

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:41.748
terms to the left side, so that way I can set this equation, or this left hand

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:46.736
side of my equation, equal to 0. We'll combine like terms first by adding 5x and

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:52.000
6x. To get 11x. Next we'll subtract these two terms from both sides of our

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.042
equation. The 14 doesn't have a like term on this side of the equation, so I put

00:00:57.042 --> 00:01:03.246
it last. This gives us five x squared minus three x minus 14 which equals zero.

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:08.894
Next we want to factor this quadratic by find the factors of negative 70 That

00:01:08.894 --> 00:01:14.010
sum to negative 3. These factors are negative 10 and positive 7. We use these 2

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.555
factors to rewrite our middle term, and factor by grouping. So this quadratic

00:01:18.555 --> 00:01:23.322
can be factored as 5x plus 7 times x minus 2. We want to make sure that we set

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:28.348
it equal to zero. So we can set each factor equal to zero. And solve for x. We

00:01:28.348 --> 00:01:33.860
set this first factor equal to 0. And the second factor equal to 0. Doing so we

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.438
can solve and get x equal to negative 7 5ths, and x is equal to positive 2. But

00:01:39.438 --> 00:01:43.408
we're not done yet. We want to make sure we check the excluded values to see if

00:01:43.408 --> 00:01:48.301
either of these are not part of the solution. Well, the only excluded values are

00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:52.623
x equals 0 and x equals negative 1. If x were 0 this fraction would be

00:01:52.623 --> 00:01:57.800
undefined. And if x is equal to negative one, this fraction would be undefined.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.520
So our two values of negative 7 fifths and positive 2 are correct.
