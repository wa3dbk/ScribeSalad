Congratulations. You made it through homework assignment number 1.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You learned about Monte Carlo robot localization

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with a technique that I often call histogram filters.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You've implemented it successfully and learned a lot about statistics.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is all just a single class. Congratulations. That's really awesome.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, next week we talk about common filters and tracking other cards in traffic,

00:00:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and you're going to implement our common filter, so I'll see you in the next class.
