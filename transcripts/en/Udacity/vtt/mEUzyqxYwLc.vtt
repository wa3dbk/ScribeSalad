00:00:00.058 --> 00:00:03.261
So let's take a quick quiz on when we want to be using compact.

00:00:03.261 --> 00:00:08.500
In general, compact is going to be most useful in scenarios where we compact away,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.530
where we delete a small or large number of elements,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.058
and the computation we need to run on each surviving element is cheap or expensive.
