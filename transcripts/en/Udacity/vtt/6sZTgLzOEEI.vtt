We've just seen that if we have negative 2 is less than 2x is less than 10, you

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:09.100
can divide everything by two. And we'll end up with negative 1 is less than x is

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.607
less than 5. Let's look further into how we can solve inequalities. But this

00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:18.202
time we'll just start by dealing with single inequalities. Let's say I have 3x

00:00:18.202 --> 00:00:23.148
is greater than or equal to 12. Can you write an inequality in this box just for

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:27.823
x. So I'd like you to isolate x on one side of the inequality and then have just

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.458
a number on the other side.
