00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.547
So what we saw in the answer to the last question, was that log base 10 of 3

00:00:04.547 --> 00:00:09.000
million, which is equal to log base 10 of 3 times 10 to the 6th is equal to log

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.810
base 10 of 3 plus log base 10 of 10 to the 6th. So what we've done here, is

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.292
split the input to our log into factors. And then we summed the logs of those

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:26.320
factors. Over here, I've written out the other answers we came up with in the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.294
last question. So what I'd like to know now is, does this process of finding

00:00:31.294 --> 00:00:35.320
factors of the input of the log and then summing the logs of those factors,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.869
work for these other examples? Please answer yes or no.
