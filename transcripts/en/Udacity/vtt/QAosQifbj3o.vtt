00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.995
This is an irrational number. And because it's an irrational number, just like

00:00:05.007 --> 00:00:09.970
all the other numbers we've talked about, it's also a real number. We know this

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:14.565
because the square root of 530,000 has an infinitely long decimal with no

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:19.120
repeating pattern in it. In fact, any root of some integer, m, is either an

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:23.779
integer or an irrational number. That's just kind of a fun fact for you to know,

00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.684
and something useful for you to check answers later on.
