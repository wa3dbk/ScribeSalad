00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.930
So let's take a look at the code, that

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.610
adds a task to the default task queue. So it's

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.160
createConference in Conference API, and then this is the code

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.060
that we already looked at to get the profile. Get

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.200
the conference key, get an ID for the conference

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.480
key. And here is the code to get the default

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.860
queue. And you're going to need, of course, when you did

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.700
this you would've needed to import queue and queue factory.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.245
So, to get the default queue we just call

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:31.710
queuefactory.getdefaultqueue. I updated my code to use a transaction,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.620
so here's the code for starting the transaction, ofy.transact,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.310
and then we run it, we run the transaction. Then

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.120
we get the profile entity from the data store,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.540
we create a new conference subject. We save the conference

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.120
in the profile, entities in the data store, this

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.810
is all code from before. This is a new code

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.650
to add the task. You see here that

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.630
the first argument is ofy, don't get transaction. This

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:58.410
is how you get the current transaction when

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.315
you're using Objectify. And then we add, we call

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:05.425
queue.add. And then the rest of the arguments to add are

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:12.140
TaskOptions.Builder. Basically, building up the task options with URL,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.390
tasks, send confirmation email. Good job. I fixed the URL there, and then the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.600
parameter you want to send the email and

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.470
we want to send the information about the conference.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.920
Then we return the conference from the transaction.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.450
And we finally, return the conference from the function.
