00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.277
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, if no time has passed, then we start with $200. That's how much was

00:00:04.277 --> 00:00:08.918
initially in our savings account. We know each month we save exactly $100. So,

00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:13.382
after one month I would have $300, and then, if another month goes by, I save

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:18.136
another $100, and we can easily fill out the rest of the table. But remember, in

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:22.681
algebra, we want to know for x number of months how much money would we have.

00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:28.100
Well we start with 200 and then we multiply the number of months by 100. So we

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.452
also need to add 100x. Now we've related the amount of money we saved with the

00:00:33.452 --> 00:00:38.450
number of months, x. We have this equation, y is equal to 200 plus 100x.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.233
Congrats if you got this right. I know this isn't the easiest algebraic

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:48.147
reasoning, but if you work from a table and build it up, you can get here and we

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:53.161
can switch these two terms around. I could have the 100x come first, followed by

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:55.056
200. This is the same equation.
