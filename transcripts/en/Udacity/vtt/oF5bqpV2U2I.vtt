00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.903
This equation looks sort of funny though. Since y is the dependent variable, we

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:08.444
tend to write it by itself. With an expression in x on the other side of the

00:00:08.444 --> 00:00:13.196
equation. let's make this happen here. If we have y on this side, what belongs

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:18.156
in this box to complete the equation? Remember, we're working off of the

00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:20.364
equation x equals 3y minus 1.
