00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.693
I know you're excited to run the app. 
And I'm going to show you how to do it

00:00:03.693 --> 00:00:06.750
without a physical device, 
because we'll be using the emulator.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.581
But first, we need to install one more 
component from the Android SDK Manager.

00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:13.383
Click on this button to open up 
the Android SDK Manager.

00:00:13.383 --> 00:00:15.697
Scroll to the bottom 
of the list to find HAXM.

00:00:15.697 --> 00:00:17.874
It stands for hardware 
accelerated execution manager.

00:00:17.874 --> 00:00:20.851
And it will speed up our emulator. 
So go ahead and deselect

00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:23.969
the other packages, 
and just install this one.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.537
Accept the license, and then continue. 
We have to do one more step

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:28.502
after this to install HAXM.

00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:31.556
I'll show you the remaining steps 
on a Mac, but for the other platforms

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:33.993
you can check the link below. 
First, find Android Studio

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:37.627
under the applications folder, 
and then hit show package contents.

00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:40.289
Then, in the SDK folder, 
there'll be an extras folder

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:43.920
containing an Intel folder 
with the HAXM folder.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.555
Then, we click on the DMG file, 
open it up and then continue.

00:00:48.555 --> 00:00:51.558
Step through this installer, 
and the default values are fine.

00:00:51.558 --> 00:00:55.000
Once installation is complete, 
you can close all the windows.
