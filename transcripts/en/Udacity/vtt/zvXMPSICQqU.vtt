00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.980
So that's pretty cool.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:04.980
So we have an upper bound, that says
that our algorithm is not going to take

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.250
any longer than n squared k steps
to explore a deterministic MBP.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.910
And a reasonable question to ask is,
is that good or bad?

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.430
And so what I want to argue next
is that there's a lower bound,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.340
saying that no algorithm can do
better than n squared k, and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.190
therefore algorithms
actually doing very well.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.110
&gt;&gt; No.
Well, as well as one can do.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt; As well as one can do, right.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.510
Which may help you well enough.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.335
Now when in fact, really when you're
trying to learn in this kinds of

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.880
domains, you don't really want to
make worst case assumptions.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.490
So this is under a worst
case assumptions,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.510
where there's really no
structure in the MBP.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.761
How many mistakes might we make en
route to finding the optimal policy.

00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:41.295
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:43.650
&gt;&gt; All right, so
let me draw a little MBP.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.210
So here's an MBP that we can
call a combination lock.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.780
So the basic idea of this is that we've
got some kind of n state sequence and

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.070
two actions,
which I drew as purple and blue here.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.400
And each state has a purple action and
a blue action.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.930
And one of them goes
back to this reset state,

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.830
this state number one, while the other
one advances up the chain one step.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.770
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.620
&gt;&gt; And so
we need to explore this whole thing say,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.300
because there's some kind of giant
reward over here, and every step that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.690
we're not making along this chain and
then looping around here is a mistake.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.310
So the question is,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.675
how many mistakes might we make en
route to finding this plus 100?

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:22.390
So let's say we start off
in this state number one.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.820
So what would our max do in this case,
Charles?

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.810
&gt;&gt; It would pick one of them,
because they look the same.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.090
&gt;&gt; Right, so it's in this state,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.980
it doesn't know anything
about the outgoing actions.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.070
And it knows that there is purple and
blue, and it picks one.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.140
And I tried to be kind of random about
the way which one would go forward and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.020
which one would go backwards so

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.390
there's really nothing you
can do other than guess.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.320
If you guess wrong,
then you take this blue action and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.280
end up back in state one.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.540
At which point you would say,
I know what that does,

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.740
let me try the purple action.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.340
And now it advances
us to the next state.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.050
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; All right, so what happens from here?

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.910
&gt;&gt; Well, you don't know what time
it's going to happen next so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.930
you pick one of them.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.560
&gt;&gt; Right.
So if we choose the purple one we get

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.180
reset back to the beginning, at which
point we can kind of march up the chain,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.190
and, you know, get back to where we
have some unknown information and

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.550
then try blue.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.110
But basically each time we're exploring
one of these states it's taking us,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.020
well, if you think of it as state i.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.810
To explore state i we take one action,
which resets us back to the beginning

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.710
and it takes us i steps
to get back to i.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.320
And then one more to get
to the new state i +1.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.810
So the total number of steps
that we're taking here is

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.430
going to be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4,
all the way up to n.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.240
&gt;&gt; Right,
that looks very n squared to me.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.055
&gt;&gt; Which is exactly right,
which is n squarish, as some people say.

00:02:37.055 --> 00:02:39.855
And so this total number of steps we
take, it's not literally n squared, but

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:41.695
it's some constant times n squared.

00:02:41.695 --> 00:02:43.845
And you can't really
do better than that.

00:02:43.845 --> 00:02:46.845
Now in this particular case, we really
wanted to prove a lower bound that was

00:02:46.845 --> 00:02:50.245
going to relate it to k times n squared,
where k is the number of actions,

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.425
here the number of actions was two.

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:53.785
Do you think the same example
actually kind of scales up for

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:54.645
greater and greater k?

00:02:54.645 --> 00:02:57.025
How would you change this example so

00:02:57.025 --> 00:03:02.070
that it would basically force us
to do k actions times n squared.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.310
&gt;&gt; Well, I can just make all but
one of them send you back.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, so
let's think about what that would do.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.360
So if we had k actions, one of them sent
us forward and we have no idea which one

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.780
and all the other ones send
us back to the beginning.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.620
Then what's going to happen is we're
going to have each time we explore state

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.690
i, we're actually going to get reset and
have to take n steps k times.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.500
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So for each of the n states,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.890
essentially, we're going to have to
explore all the actions and for all but

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.860
one of them it's going to be n
steps to get back to where we

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.710
are exploring again.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.360
And look at that!

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.450
&gt;&gt; That looks like n squared k.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.290
Or Kn squared.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I just reordered it so that it
looked more like the thing on the top.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.310
&gt;&gt; If you remember from our
last machine learning class,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.530
everything got us back to k and n.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.340
And there you go.
&gt;&gt; Oh!

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.864
Nice.

00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:48.910
&gt;&gt; It's all the same.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.270
&gt;&gt; It's always k's nearest neighbors,
but in this case, it's not.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.660
&gt;&gt; It's k's farthest neighbors.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.100
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah,
I guess there's some truth in that.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.640
That each time we take an action that we
don't know about, we're getting unlucky,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.610
and we're having to take a very long
trail to get back to where we started.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.480
But no,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.100
I'm just saying k nearest Neighbors
is a particular kind of algorithm.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.760
And here, n doesn't stand for
neighbor here, right?

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.090
It stands for number of states.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.390
&gt;&gt; I prefer to think that n stands for
neighbor in this case.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.830
&gt;&gt; Great, okay, then I think
we've got this one under control.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.399
So that's the argument that I
wanted to make there is that

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.610
we really do have to take kn squared in
the worst case in a deterministic NBP,

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.850
to figure out what's going on and
stop making mistakes.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and there's no error on it,
because this is like, well,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.920
it really is a combination lock.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.330
The way you draw it it's a random
binary string that gets you to the end.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.660
Unless you get extremely lucky,
there's no way to figure out

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.270
what it is without trying all
the combinations, sort of.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.610
&gt;&gt; Well, it's not all the combinations.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.730
So combination lock in some ways
is actually not a great name here,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.600
so in particular, what makes it
a combination lock is to make it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.410
across this whole chain of end things.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.250
You have to choose the right color and
sequence.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.569
You have to choose, in this case,
purple, blue, purple, purple, blue,

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:54.808
blue, blue, blue, blue.

00:04:54.808 --> 00:04:56.650
So you have to kind of crack the lock.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.740
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; In a real combination lock,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.360
if you get any of these wrong,
at the end of it,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.820
you don't get to find out which ones
were right and which ones were wrong.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.380
You get reset back to the beginning and
you just have to start again.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.950
So you really end up taking like number
of actions to the number of states.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.740
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Different combinations.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.430
Here we're lucky enough to
actually know, hey, the first

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.510
i parts of our combination are correct,
and we're just guessing the ith one.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.270
&gt;&gt; So really,
it's a sequential combination lock.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is not very secure from
a, I don't know, security standpoint.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.940
&gt;&gt; Well, in particular you can
solve it in n squared time

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.320
instead of k to the n time.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.560
&gt;&gt; Right, so n squared doesn't sound so

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.180
bad if you're comparing
it to k to the n.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.855
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; But anyway,

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:37.420
[LAUGH] the point is that
we can't get around that.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.600
And so
that's really what I wanted you to do.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.660
So the next thing I want to talk about
is combining this idea with the bandit

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.590
idea that we talked about earlier,
and get an algorithm for general MDPs.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:48.090
&gt;&gt; Okay.
