00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As you might have seen in some of the preceding units,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I like to write parody songs about computer science topics.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I provide links to my songs about sorting and the halting problem,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I also have one about binary numbers that turned out to be pretty popular.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
When I was recording the units of this class,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I decided I wanted to make a new song for this class.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I told my friends at Udacity, and they were very supportive.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In fact, they joined in and helped me make my first collaborative academic parody song.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I wanted to use a currently popular song and use it to touch on the main topics in the class.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It was very fun to make, and I'm so appreciate to my friends at Udacity for making it happen.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I think it came out really well, and I hope you enjoy it.
