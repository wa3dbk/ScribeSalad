Since the conference app doesn't use touch that much, we're

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.400
going to have you take a look at adding touch support

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.130
to a different example. Let's take a look at how we

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.270
would code a simple drawing application on a web page. First,

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.670
let's look at this, as we would write it for the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.430
mouse. You can see where we've hooked the mouse down, mouse

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.660
move and mouse up events. And you can see are handlers

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.820
for each one of these simply creates a new stroke and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.560
the adds points to that stroke as we go.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.690
Now, we'd like you to change this code to use

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.610
pointer events. Don't forget to set the touch action attribute

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.269
on the HTML element that you're using as an event

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.420
listener. We've already included the polymer polyfill, so you

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.990
don't need to worry about doing that. Just change the

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.980
event handlers to be pointer events and then make any

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.080
appropriate changes to the handlers themselves if there are any.
