00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's move on to drawing lines.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.340
You can follow along by loading
up 1.3.03 demo drawing lines.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.160
So first, let's get start up
as usual by declaring and

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.080
initializing a ShapeRenderer.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.364
Also, we gotta remember to
clean up after ourselves and

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.910
get rid of anything we're not using.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.275
Also note,
instead of using ApplicationListener,

00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:23.910
we're using ApplicationAdapter here.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.150
ApplicationAdapter is just a convenience
implementation of ApplicationListener.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.680
It stubs out all of the required
methods with implementations that

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.420
don't do anything.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.152
So all we've got here is actually
create, dispose, and render.

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:40.950
All right, as always, all
the interesting stuff happens in render.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.780
So first, we clear the screen.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.510
We actually clear the screen and then,
we start a new shapeRenderer batch.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.745
This time, using the Line ShapeType.

00:00:48.745 --> 00:00:53.350
All right, now we're going to draw
a line from 0, 0 to 100, 100.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.641
Let's give it a try.

00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:59.075
Well, that didn't go according to plan.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:02.495
There's nothing on the screen and
we actually got an error down here.

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.505
Let's see.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:04.595
Illegal state exception.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:08.115
Call end before beginning
a new shape batch.

00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:08.845
Oh, right.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.850
So all we did here was
start the batch and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.070
then draw a line but
didn't end the batch.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.370
Then the next time render got called
it tried to begin a batch but

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.320
shape render was already in the middle
of a batch so we got a crash.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.340
All right, let's try this again.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.010
Awesome.
We're in business.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.960
Let's try something more interesting.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.370
Let's try drawing a line of a different
color, by using shapeRenderer.setColor,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.680
and then using one of
the pre-defined color constants.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.213
Then we'll draw another line
slightly offset from the first one.

00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:39.281
Hm, whoops.

00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:41.001
Well we got our magenta line, but

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.340
the first line we drew
also ended up magenta.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.580
The way colors work with shapeRenderer
is it will assume you want white

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.760
until you tell it about
some other color.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.370
However, if you tell it
about some other color,

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.360
it will retroactively assume everything
you wanted you draw before that,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.400
you wanted to draw that color as well.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.627
let's try this setup.

00:01:57.627 --> 00:02:00.792
Hey, there we go,
that's what we were looking for.

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:04.270
We can also set colors
using our RGBA values.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.370
Now before we draw this line,
what color is this?

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.245
So it's fully opaque because
alpha's one, so that's good.

00:02:11.245 --> 00:02:18.370
All right there's no red and there's
no blue, so the line must be green.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.040
Let's run it and see.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.860
Our predictions were correct..

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.570
We can even do fancy things like drawing
lines with gradients by specifying

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.230
the color at start of a line and
the color at the end.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.000
And there we go.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.890
We got a nice fade from blue to red.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.630
One more useful thing for drawing lines.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.220
If we wanted to draw a whole
series of line segments,

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.300
it would get really tiresome
to draw each one individually.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.780
So we also have polyline.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.300
Polyline takes an array of floats,
where the floats at the even positions

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.830
are the x coordinates, and the floats at
the odd positions are the y coordinates.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.550
If we give this one a try,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.710
we see this crazy path with a bunch
of connected line segments.
