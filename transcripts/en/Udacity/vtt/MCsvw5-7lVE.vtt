00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.195
When building a successful e-commerce
business, the first thing that you have

00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:11.297
to realize is that the best customer
is a customer who keeps coming back.

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:13.380
And so as we look at Teespring,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.066
the people who do really well
on our platform are people

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:21.410
who've been able to build a brand
with our buyers on Teespring.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.810
And been able to bring them
back over and over and

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.130
over again to be able to
purchase more and more products.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.740
And the best thing,
what you can do to actually ensure

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.170
that is really invest
in customer service.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:43.380
And really invest in sort of answering
any questions that your customers have.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.350
And kind of really making
your customers feel that

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.570
you as the kind of e-commerce platform,
or

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.640
as a product owner,
actually care about what they want.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.930
And so it's really easy to kind
of think about, all right,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.910
let's optimize the purchase flow,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.730
let's kind of cut costs where we can,
let's offer the cheapest price.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.090
But at the end of the day, what's
going to bring that buyer back again is

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.510
the customer service and the actual end
to end experience that you offer them.
