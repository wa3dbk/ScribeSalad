00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.100
The graph that we selected in the last video is unlike any other function we've

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.434
seen before. And in fact, it's a different kind of exponential function. This

00:00:09.434 --> 00:00:14.439
graph shows another function that follows the same sort of pattern. Now, since

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:17.916
I've told you that the graph is exponential, we have an idea of what kind of

00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:23.690
behavior it exhibits. Every time we add some constant amount to x, f is going

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.448
to increase by a certain percent, or is going to be multiplied by a certain

00:00:28.448 --> 00:00:35.980
number. So, for example, if we add 1 to x here, what is f of x multiplied by?

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.230
I'll label a few points on this graph to make things a bit simpler. Now think

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.768
carefully about this. Make sure that you fill in the number f of x is

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.200
multiplied by.
