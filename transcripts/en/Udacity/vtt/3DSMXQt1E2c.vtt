00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.460
We know from the last question that the y-intercept of the function y equals 1

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.014
half to the x is 0,1 as we can see right here. What if I wanted a function

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:19.340
identical to this one, but with a y-intercept of 0,4 instead? Which of these

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.142
function do you think that is? Here's a little hint. Think about what

00:00:24.142 --> 00:00:30.970
transformation you'd have to do to move the point 0,1 to the point 0,4 instead.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.310
Then, think about what substitution you need to do in this equation to make

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.360
that transformation happen.
