00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So there are lots of different ways we could define "bigger."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's one possibility:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're going to make a procedure; we'll give it the name, "bigger".

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It takes 2 inputs.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We can give them any name we want.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Since there's no real meaning to the inputs, we'll just use "a" and "b".

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And now we want to use a test to figure out which one is bigger.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We're going to use a comparison, so we're going to see if "a" is greater than "b".

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then we want the result to be the value of "a"--that's the bigger one.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we'll return "a".

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If that's not the case--well, if it was the case, we returned "a";

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
if it's not the case, then we're going to get here, and we can return "b".

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So this way of defining "bigger" is a little bit asymmetrical.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Given what you've seen so far, this is probably the best way to do it.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There's another way to do that, that uses an extra construct

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that allows us to have 2 directions that we can use the "if" in.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So instead of just having what we had before,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000
where we have an "if" and we have a test expression,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and we have a block that executes when the test expression is True,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
what we want to do is have something that executes when the test expression is False.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And we can do that by using an "else".

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We can have--after the "if", instead of the next statement,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we can have an "else" that's part of the "if".

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This means if the test expression was True,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.950
we're going to execute this block.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.000
If it's not True, we're going to execute the other block,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is inside the "else".

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
As before, the indentation tells us when we're done with the block,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so after the "else", whatever code is here

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
will execute whether the test expression is True or False.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.831
The test expression determines whether we execute

00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:41.000
the block inside the "if" or the block inside the "else".

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So let's see how to rewrite "bigger" using "else".

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We'll use "a" and "b" as the names of our parameters, as before,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and we'll start the same--we're going to have our "if"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and our test is still "a &gt; b",

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and if that's the case, then we return "a".

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Instead of having the next statement return "b",

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we're going to think about having an "else" clause

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that says: well, if "a" was not greater than "b", what shall we do?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If "a" is not greater than "b", then "b" is either the same size or bigger,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and what we want to do is return "b".

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So this means the same thing.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In this case, neither one is particularly better.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I think this one is a little more symmetrical.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
There are lots of cases where it makes things work a lot better by using "else".

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And I'll show you one way that this could be different.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
If we didn't want to have two returns--

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.169
maybe we'll want to do something else with the result, instead of just return it--

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.000
well, with the "if, else" we can do that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.446
So we can have--inside the first "if", we'll assign to the variable "r" the result "a".

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:40.000
That's going to be the one that's bigger.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Inside the "else", we'll assign to the variable "r" the result "b".

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That's the one that's bigger when the "if" test fails.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And now the next statement here could return "r".

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Usually, we like our programs to be shorter

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
rather than bigger.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
In this case, when we're defining "bigger",

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
maybe the "bigger" version is better because that's a little easier to understand and follow.
