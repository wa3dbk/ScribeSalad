00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.029
Now let's convert this into a quiz. Now

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.500
remember, that we use this tree to find out

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.430
our representation. We need one bit for sending

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.840
A, two for D, and three each for B

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.390
and C. So, if you send a message

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.150
in this language, what is the expected message size?

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.530
Write your answer down here. Remember the unit for

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.730
this answer is going to be in bits. Go.
