00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here are the three lines of code I used to program this in.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
First I computed the sum of a vector Q using the function sum,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which makes it really easy.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Then I go through all the elements in Q and just divide it by s,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which is the normalization, and when I run it, I get 1/9, 1/3, 1/3, 1/9, and 1/9.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So I've just implemented the absolute key function of localization,

00:00:24.000 --> 09:59:59.000
which is called the measurement update.
