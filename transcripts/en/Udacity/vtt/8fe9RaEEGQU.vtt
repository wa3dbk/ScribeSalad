I'm Eric Haines and I'll be teaching about something I love, computer graphics.

00:00:04.208 --> 00:00:08.394
What's not to like? In this area of computer science, you will write code to

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:12.828
create cool pictures. I've been programming computers since 1974 and I've been

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:17.182
working on computer graphics since 1983. With computer chips constantly getting

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:21.068
faster and with graphics accelerators, in particular evolving at a rapid clip,

00:00:21.068 --> 00:00:25.106
the rules about what's possible change time and time again. There's always new

00:00:25.106 --> 00:00:29.776
things to learn. I guarantee that the computer languages and hardware we will

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:34.016
use will change. The good news for you as a student is that I'm going to focus

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:37.942
on what makes computer graphics tick. The underlying principles I'll cover here

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:42.075
will give you a firm foundation in the field. I'm particularly excited that I'll

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:46.650
be able to teach this class now. A few years ago, such a class would have been

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.145
extremely difficult. With the rise of a web technology called WebGL, you can

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:55.230
simply click on a link and immediately run a 3D demo for yourself. In some

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.630
trivial sense, everything you see on your computer screen can be called computer

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.326
graphics. Word processors, videos, such as this one of me, paint programs, and

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:06.003
much else result in images on your monitor.
