00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.566
It's time to expose the ingernexs
prostate cuff configmat and

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:09.040
[INAUDIBLE] assert secrets to
secure monolith pot at runtime.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.540
Examine the secure monolith
pocket figuration file.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.345
This is our first multi-container pod.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.365
You'll see that we have the nginx and
monolith containers in here.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:22.325
These containers are deployed
in the same pod because they

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:23.795
depend on each other.

00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.315
We've talked about the monolith before.

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:26.345
So let's focus on nginx.

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:29.785
There are two things
interesting to note here.

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.785
One, we've added a graceful
shutdown to the container by

00:00:32.785 --> 00:00:34.445
adding a life cycle hook.

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.150
So on shutdown,
we want to run that command.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.310
This will allow ingernex to do the right
thing, handle all remaining traffic and

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.940
shutdown cleanly.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.490
Two, at the bottom of our
pod configuration file.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.010
You'll see we added
corresponding volumes.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.490
So that the internet's container Can
now access our secrets and configs.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.030
Create the secure model
of pod using kubectl.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.440
If we examine the secure-monolith pod,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.070
we'll notice that it has two
containers running inside of it now.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.970
Now that the secure-monolith
pod is up and

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.150
running we can access it using
kubectl port-forward command.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.853
In a second terminal,

00:01:10.853 --> 00:01:17.352
let's forward local port 10443 to
443 of the secure mine with pod.

00:01:17.352 --> 00:01:20.700
Remember, 443 is what our Internet's
container is listening on.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.430
Use a curl command to test the http
end point in another terminal.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.000
And now we get a response
back from the server.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.510
Over the secure https connection.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.290
We can use the kuectl command to verify
traffic to the Internet container on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.370
the secure monolith part.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.708
The kubernetes ttl port
forwarding command is great for

00:01:41.708 --> 00:01:43.320
testing pods directly.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.000
But in production,
you want to expose pod using services.
