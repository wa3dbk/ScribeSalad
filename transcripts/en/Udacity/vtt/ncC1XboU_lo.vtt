00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.740
So now I hope you understand how to use dictionaries. And

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.370
so the next step, we're going to go back to the search engine

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.190
code from the previous unit, and modify it to use dictionaries instead

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.020
of indexes. And this will have the big advantage that now

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.990
we can do our lookups in constant time as long as we

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.380
increase the number of buckets with the number of keywords. So to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.770
start thinking about this, the question is which of the procedures that

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.510
we've defined for our search engine will we need to change to

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.540
make use of the dictionary instead of using the list?

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.250
So, here's the choices, all the procedures that we've defined

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.180
so far. So we had a procedure get_all_links, and get_all_links

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.950
would scan a web page, return a list of all the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.786
links in that web page. We had the procedure crawl_web;

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:45.080
we have crawl_web, which started with a seed page, and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.770
then followed all the links that could be found in

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.690
that page collecting pages, and for each page, collecting the keywords

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.410
on that page and adding them to the search

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.960
index. We have add_page_to_index that would take a page; it

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.600
was called by crawl_web when it, a new page was

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.530
found and would add that page to the index by

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.800
finding all the words on that page, adding them to

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.930
the index. We had add_to_index, which would take the index,

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.670
a keyword and the URL where it was found and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.460
add that location to the index. And we had lookup,

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.850
which would take a keyword and give us a list of all the URLs

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
where that keyword would appear. So to answer this, you may need to look at

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.270
the code, and you'll find it on the website. Think about which ones of

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.380
these procedures we'll need to change to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.880
replace the list index with the dictionary index.
