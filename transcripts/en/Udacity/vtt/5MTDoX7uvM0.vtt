Earlier on, we looked at solving equations which looked something like this.

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.834
Here, we have 3x plus 4 equals 19. Let's consider something slightly different

00:00:09.846 --> 00:00:14.519
however. What if instead, we have the equation y equals 3x plus 4, let's say

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:19.066
that we want know the value of x when y is equal to 19. Well, we know on one

00:00:19.078 --> 00:00:24.550
hand that we can just use substitution to replace y here with 19 and end up with

00:00:24.562 --> 00:00:30.095
the equation that we saw before. Then, we could isolate x and have an answer for

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:35.665
it. We can also however use a graph to figure out the x-coordinate when y equals

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:40.995
19. Please use this graph to find that x value. Also, please take note of the

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.443
scale of the x-axis versus the, the y-axis.

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:51.400
On the y-axis, every grid line up counts as 2, whereas, on the x-axis, it's only

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:51.531
1.
