00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] I want to give you a better idea what these actually look like,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and my wife was kind enough to let me take some parts out of her computer.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Actually, she took them out of the computer so I could show you what they look like.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is DRAM; this is 2 GB of DRAM,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and what a gigabyte means is approximately a billion bytes.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What it actually means I'll show you in the Python interpreter.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In Python we can do exponentiation by using a star star.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is what we would write mathematically as 2 to the power 10.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So 2 to the power 10 is 1024.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is called the kilobyte; we use the prefixes like the thousand prefixes,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but the actual values in computing are usually powers of 2 instead.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
They're a little bit different than 1000.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's actually 1024 when we talk about a kilobyte,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and a megabyte is 1024 KB.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
That's equivalent to 2 to the power 20.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
A megabyte is just over a million bytes.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
A gigabyte is 2 to the power of 30,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which is just over a billion bytes,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and a terabyte is 2 to the power of 40,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which is just over a trillion bytes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
These are the main units we're going to talk about when we think about memory.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here we have 2 GB of memory, so that means we have

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
2 to the 30 that would be 1 GB.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We have 2 to the 30 times 2, which is 2 GB times 8,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which is the number of bits in a byte, and 1 bit is the equivalent to a light switch.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It can be in 1 of 2 states, so with 1 byte we have the equivalent of 8 light switches.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is comparable to having 17 billion light switches.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The kind of memory that we have here is actually DRAM,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
so it's really more like having 17 billion buckets,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and that means when you turn your computer off

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
everything that's stored in the DRAM is lost.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
To keep the memory here, it's like a bucket,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but instead of storing water it's storing electrons.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's a capacitor and when the power goes off that memory is lost.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
There are many different types of memory inside your computer.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I mentioned registers briefly, that's the fastest memory

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that is built right into the processor.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The main things that matter that distinguish the memory that you have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is the latency which is the time it takes to get a response.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So the latency you can think of as the time to retrieve a value from memory.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We'll talk about latency more next class in terms of what that means in networks,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
which is really the same thing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
For this DRAM the latency is about 12 nanoseconds,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and as a reminder, a nanosecond is 1 billionth of a second.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The other thing that really distinguishes memory,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the reason we have so many different types of it,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
is the cost.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The cost varies depending on mostly the latency and the amount of memory you can store.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The cost for this memory, if you bought it today, is about $10 for 2 GB.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
That's 10 US dollars, about 7 Euros.
