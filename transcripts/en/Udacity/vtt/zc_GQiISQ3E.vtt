00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, here's a question that's really, really hard.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When we graph the new Gaussian, I can graph one that's very wide and very peaky.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If I were to measure where the peak of the new Gaussian is,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
this would be a very narrow and skinny Gaussian.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This would be one whose width would be in between the two Gaussians.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
This is one that's even wider than the two original Gaussians.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Which one do you believe is the correct posterior after multiplying these two Gaussians?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is an insanely hard question.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'd like you to take your chances here,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.575
and I'll explain to you the answer in just a second.
