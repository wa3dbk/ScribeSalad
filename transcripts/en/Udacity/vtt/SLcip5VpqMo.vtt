00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.540
So, to reiterate just once more.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.560
Using the key .prototype here, instead of the key .method is purely cosmetic.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.081
Don't get confused thinking about the possible effects that this might have on

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:14.770
the in-memory model at runtime, since there really aren't any.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.510
Here's some examples of associations,

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.350
you might be making in your mind that would mislead you.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.010
First of all, the Car function does not delegate it's field lookups to

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.600
the objects stored at Car.prototype.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.000
There is no such thing as car.move, for example.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.364
We never imagined that Car would delegate it's field lookups to

00:00:33.364 --> 00:00:36.890
car.methods and so, we shouldn't expect that car would delegate it's

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.240
field lookups to Car.prototype.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.700
Another point is that result object from the Car function.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.410
Only delegate to Car.prototype because of our

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.880
own call to this Object.create function.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.460
It's not because we're using the key .prototype to store this object that we

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.650
have a relationship between instances and the Car.prototype object.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.550
So you should really see this .prototype object as a freely provided object for

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.840
storing things with no additional special characteristics.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.670
Mentally, you can substitute the word .methods if it helps you reason about it.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.708
To underscore my point, observe that this Example function has the exact same

00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:21.535
relationship with the Car.prototype object that the Car function does.

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.755
Both functions return objects that are set up to

00:01:24.755 --> 00:01:28.250
delegate to the object stored at Car.prototype.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.100
The fact that the prototype object is stored as a property of

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.660
only one of those two function is completely immaterial.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.420
Both functions behave exactly the same as they would,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.020
if that prototype object had been merely stored in some global variable.
