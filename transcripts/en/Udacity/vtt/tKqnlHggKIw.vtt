00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.340
These have just been some of the methods that we

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.880
can use when performing statistical tests on data. As you

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.109
can imagine, there are a number of additional ways to

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.820
handle data from different probability distributions or data that looks

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.560
like it came from no probability distribution whatsoever. Data scientists

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.190
can perform many statistical procedures. But it's vital to understand

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.980
the underlying structure of the data set and consequently, which

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.440
statistical tests are appropriate given the data that we have.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.530
There are many different types of statistical tests and even many

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.460
different schools of thought within statistics

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.870
regarding the correct way to analyze

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.640
data. This has really just been an opportunity to get your

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.884
feet wet with statistical analysis. It's just the tip of the iceberg.
