00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.560
In this problem, we're going to not repeat, repeated work, by

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.390
implementing a relatively simple optimization technique. In this optimization,

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.440
more commonly known as Common Expression Elimination, let's say we're given this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.110
snippet of code. If we look closely, we can see that the values of a,

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.920
b and c. Don't change, yet we re-compute it when we calculate z.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.720
So, we're doing two additional, addition operations that we need to,

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.110
It's perfectly possible to replace that sub-expression with the variable x.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.210
That way, we can take advantage of the fact that we calculated x, and

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.190
avoid the additional work. Keep in mind that optimization was only possible

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.120
because the values of a, b and c hadn't changed since the last time we used it.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.920
Here I've changed the middle statement to be b equals 2.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.790
That means that if I did the same optimization where I replaced this.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.420
With X, it's very much possible that X doesn't actually equal a,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.510
b and c added together. So our strategy for

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.260
solving this is is going to be very similar to what you would do by hand.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.860
We're going to go through each statement one by one and in this scenario, let's

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.880
say we're going to remember that we've already calculated the values of a plus b

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.480
plus c and that happens to be stored in X. That way if we see a request. For

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.930
a plus b plus c, we can simply replace it with x. However, at each step we also

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.840
need to keep track of what values have changed. Here we can see that b equals 2

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.190
now invalidates a plus b plus c, because we used the value of b there.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.610
Let's get started. Code time. So here I have the code for

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.640
a solution. The first thing we have here is a helper function.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.840
That returns a list of all of the variables used in an expression. That way

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.450
we can feed it a plus b plus c, it'll return a, b and c in a list. That way,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.170
it makes it much easier to check if new statements invalidate a cached response.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.690
So here we have our optimize function that takes in the abstract syntax tree.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.680
First thing we do is declare our empty data structures. First thing is

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.830
the dictionary that has the saved calculations. And then we have the resulting.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.226
Optimized abstract syntax tree that starts out empty. So we're going to go

00:02:20.226 --> 00:02:23.550
through each statement in our abstract syntax tree. And extract a little bit of

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.890
info from that statement to make it easier to reason about and write the code.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.660
The first thing we do in this loop is to check if the right hand side of this.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.450
Statement has already been computed. And we have a version of that right hand

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
side, that doesn't have any values that have been changed. That means that we

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.490
can use it. If that's the case, we are going to create our new statement.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.180
With the simplified right hand side. Otherwise we're going to remove. The saved

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.210
expression calculations that use variables that we modify in this statement, and

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.540
then we're going to update our available dictionary of safe calculations. And

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.120
before we're done with the loop,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.530
we're going to add this new statement onto our abstract syntax tree, and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.430
once we're done with everything, we're going to return the result.
