00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.604
Before we used the equation of a line to draw a graph, but how about this time

00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:09.074
we use the graph to find the equation? I've drawn three lines for you on the set

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:13.854
of axes, and I'd like you to start by finding out the slope and the y-coordinate

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:18.517
of the y-intercept for each of these lines. Please notice that I have labeled

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.076
them f, g, and h. So, just fill in this table with the proper values for m and

00:00:23.088 --> 00:00:23.164
b.
