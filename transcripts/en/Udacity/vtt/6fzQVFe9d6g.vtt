Classical raytracing gives us a lot of paths from the eye into the environment.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.498
However, there are various paths ignored by this basic algorithm. What paths

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.960
are ignored? Paths from the eye to the background. Paths from a light to an

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.718
object to a diffuse object. Paths from a light to a mirror to an object. Or

00:00:16.718 --> 00:00:19.919
paths from the eye to the light itself. Check all that apply.
