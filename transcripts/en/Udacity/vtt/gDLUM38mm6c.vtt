00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.360
Okay, the next phase of our quiz. So, we've previously

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.600
wrote this make password hash function that takes a name and

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.910
a password and that returns a salted version of that password.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.970
Now we need to write the next version the next function,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.410
which is going to basically take a name and a password

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.850
as if a user entered it you know, on the login

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.320
form or something and a hash value from our database and

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.900
returns true if they match. Now, you're going to have to modify,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.625
make password hash a little bit for this to work. See if you can figure out how.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.870
I'll, I'll show you what the test case

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.060
should look like. You should be able to say

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.512
h equals make_pw_hash, name and password, and then

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:46.732
you should be able to say valid_pw spez, hunter2,

00:00:46.732 --> 00:00:50.860
h. This should print out true if you if you, if you have a valid hash. Now,

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.440
remember, in our previous demo, to give you a little hint when I

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.990
was running make password hash with the same inputs over and over, I was

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.640
getting a different result every time. That's because we're making a new salt

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.620
every time. So see if you can work around that problem. Okay. Good luck.
