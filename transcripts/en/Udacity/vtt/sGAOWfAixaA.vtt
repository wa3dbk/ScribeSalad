00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.444
To solve each of these equations, we need to take the square root of both sides

00:00:03.444 --> 00:00:08.570
of the equations. When we do this, we need to include the positive and negative

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.212
sign, since we can have either the positive root or the negative root. So x can

00:00:13.212 --> 00:00:18.716
equal plus or minus 3, or x could equal plus or minus 2. Notice that we really

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:23.760
have four solutions to the original equation. This should also make sense since

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.790
the degree here was a 4. We'll have at most four solutions to this equation,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.663
since the highest power is a 4.
