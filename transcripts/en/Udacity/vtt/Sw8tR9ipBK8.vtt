00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.840
Let's start with an informal definition of software architecture. It is

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.143
the organization or the breakdown of the system in to component subsystems or

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:14.410
modules. Architecture is almost universally done in layers.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.900
That is, there's a most abstract version, and

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.600
then the components of the abstract version are broken down into sub-components,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.820
subsystems and so on, until we get to a level, a low enough level where things

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.670
can actually be implemented. So, for architectures as we mentioned a second ago,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.940
often also make use of a stereotypical architectural styles and

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.920
we'll be looking into those styles in this lesson.
