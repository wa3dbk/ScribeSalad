We will spend a lot of time in this class referring to Reddit.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You know, we've used it as database examples, 
I refer to the system architecture, things we did,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I've referred the mistakes I've 
made over the years on Reddit.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm going to kind of take from the top how we 
built Reddit and how we grew it over the years

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then I'm going to talk with Neil, who 
is the current lead engineer of Reddit,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and he is going to talk about how they taken over 
since I've left, which is a couple of years ago now,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and continued to grow all the site 
as it has grown tremendously.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we started in June 2005--

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
me and my co-founder, my college roommate, 
his name is Alexis Ohanian.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was the engineer and Alexis was 
our kind of everything-else guy.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
He paid the rent. He did the business-guy 
stuff. He did the marketing things.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
He was my sounding board for future ideas. 
He did design work for Reddit.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Him and I basically lived Reddit for 
the first 2 years, the two of us.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When we started, the first vision 
of Reddit was written in Lisp,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which is an actually very old programming 
language, one of the first ones.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I think it was originally invented in '50s.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It is still one of those powerful languages. 
It is very fun to develop in.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
One of the other professors here in Udacity, Peter 
Norvig, is one of the world's Lisp experts

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and a couple of his books are 
extremely good on the topic of Lisp.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It is more popular out set universities than it is 
in the real world, it's really need to working.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
During this time, we had variable traffic, 
but everything was in Lisp--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
our Handlers, as you'd expect. Our HTML 
was all generated by Lisp.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Our CSS was all generated by Lisp. Javascript.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Lisp is a language that lands itself to 
generating other languages

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and other pieces of code really, really nicely.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'm not to get in to the details of it, but Lisp 
was all we had. We had Lisp plus Postgres.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We didn't have any memcached at that time. I've just 
stored everything in an in-memory hash table.
