00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The answers are get, keep, and grow--are the three parts of customer relationships.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
As we'll see, customer relationships start with get.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Get is how you actually acquire customers and get them to purchase your product.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Keep--just like it sounds.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
How do you keep customers for long period of time rather than losing the ones

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you've spent all the money acquiring?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And then grow is a neat trick that smart companies do--is that they understand that it's a lot

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
more expensive to get customers than to keep them and grow them.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so they figure out how to sell existing customers more products.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Get, keep and grow--the three components of customer relationships.
