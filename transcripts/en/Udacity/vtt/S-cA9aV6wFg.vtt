In the meme app,

00:00:00.981 --> 00:00:05.272
we need to show the Activity view in
order to enable users to share memes.

00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:07.254
Let's go back into our
experiment app and

00:00:07.254 --> 00:00:09.811
see about presenting
the ActivityViewController.

00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:12.571
We'll start out with just
an empty image object,

00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.020
we can then use that image to
instantiate a UI ActivityViewController.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.619
And then we just present it.

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.100
Let's see how that worked.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.424
And there's our Activity View.

00:00:23.424 --> 00:00:26.330
One can make an alert
view in a similar way.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.509
Here we're just constructing
our AlertViewController and

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.061
presenting it and
then we'll try and run it, and

00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.002
then we'll try and
present our AlertViewController.

00:00:35.002 --> 00:00:37.270
Oh, uh-oh, okay.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.343
So let's scroll up to the top of
the console to see what's going on.

00:00:42.343 --> 00:00:47.000
URL alert controller must have a title,
a message, or an action to display.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.752
Okay, so if we add one of those,
this should fix the error.

00:00:50.752 --> 00:00:52.340
So we'll try that.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.588
Let's close the console up.

00:00:54.588 --> 00:00:58.583
And then we'll return to our

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:03.750
ViewController and close that too.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.375
So here we're adding a title and
a message to our AlertViewController, so

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:11.138
let's see if that fixes the problem.

00:01:11.138 --> 00:01:14.410
All right,
show me an Alert View hey, sweet.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.414
Okay, now we're successfully
presenting our AlertViewController, but

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:21.415
right now there's no
way to make it go away.

00:01:21.415 --> 00:01:23.467
Remember that any time
you present a view,

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.640
you also need to provide the user
with a way to dismiss it.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.168
The first two view controllers
we presented had their

00:01:29.168 --> 00:01:30.572
own Cancel buttons built in,

00:01:30.572 --> 00:01:34.295
but Alert View doesn't have that, so
we have to solve the problem ourselves.

00:01:34.295 --> 00:01:38.937
We could just try adding this
dismissViewController method right after

00:01:38.937 --> 00:01:40.720
presentViewController.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.740
Let's see what that does.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.423
Okay, show me an alert view oh,
well it showed me an alert view but

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.244
then the alert view immediately left.

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:53.877
Which is not that surprising since we
called dismissViewController immediately

00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:56.420
after we called presentViewController.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.842
What we really want is for the AlertView
to be dismissed after the user has taken

00:02:00.842 --> 00:02:03.124
some action like clicking an OK button.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:05.993
AlertView has an interesting
way to do this with closures.

00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:08.169
As you know, closures like this one,

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.640
enable us to pass methods
around as arguments.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.335
So let's see how that looks.

00:02:13.335 --> 00:02:17.306
Okay, our AlertView appears,
I click OK, and it goes away.

00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:17.880
Perfect.
