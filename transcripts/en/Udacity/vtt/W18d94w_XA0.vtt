00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.166
And the answer here is clearly that halt of inverse halt and inverse halt returns no,

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:11.732
because that is the way that we constructed inverse halt. So if inverse halt receives an input,

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:19.566
it only terminates if halt of the program as a program and the program as the input returns no.

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:25.166
Otherwise, it would have gone into an infinite loop. And now let's think for a second about what that means.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:33.532
So halt of inverse halt and inverse halt says no. The first time inverse halt is a program, and the second time here,

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:38.999
it's the input. So what halt's saying no basically means is the following:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.532
If I take inverse halt and give it inverse halt as an input, then this does not terminate, because halt says no,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:50.432
and we assume that halt is a correct algorithm. But that's a bit strange, isn't it?

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:59.666
But now wait a minute: We just said that running the program inverse halt of inverse halt actually halts.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:07.832
But when we look at the implication of this, then it tells us that inverse halt, when run on inverse halt, does not halt.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:12.732
So, something doesn't seem quite right here. Which one is it? Does it stop or does it not stop?

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:16.667
Before we go deeper into that, let's ask the question exactly the other way around.
