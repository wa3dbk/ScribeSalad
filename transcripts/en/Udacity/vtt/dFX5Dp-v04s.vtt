00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so we've got our form,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
you've done all this before.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've got our error case.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We've got a shell of a success case.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We are going to go ahead and fix that now soon,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we're rendering our form nicely with our error message

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and preserving our fields.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So far nothing is new to you other than the templates.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The next thing we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
start adding the database so we can store the art work

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that is submitted by users.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The way you define an entity

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in Google app engine is to define a class.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So we're going to make a class called art,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and this is going to represent a submission from the user,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and this inherits from db.model,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and db.model is something that is included from Google.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You can see I've actually already imported up here

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
from Google.appengine.ext import db,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and so our art class inherits from the db.model class,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and this, this will allow us to create an entity.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So the first thing we need to do is

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we need to define the types of this entity.
