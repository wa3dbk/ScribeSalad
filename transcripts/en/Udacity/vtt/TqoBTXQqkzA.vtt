I'm having kind of a hard time when I have all these x's floating around. So,

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.883
let's just take it easy. Let's write a super simple inequality, maybe 1 is less

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:13.317
than 2. Those are two numbers that I think I can handle right now. Let's check

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:17.741
this on a number line to make sure that I'm not crazy. Well here's 1 and here's

00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:22.172
2. We're going to look at just the range of values that is less than 2, and that

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:26.895
is all of these values to the left of 2. 1 is definitely in this interval. But,

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:31.111
I was looking at our earlier inequality, I ran into a problem when I divided

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:35.526
both sides of the inequality by negative 1. I'll make some room here, and now,

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:39.945
let's see what happens if I divide both sides of the inequality by negative 1.

00:00:39.945 --> 00:00:44.229
So, what number do we get on either side of our inequality, if we divide both

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.568
sides by negative 1? Make sure you keep the numbers on the sides that they're on

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:52.265
right now for the purposes of this answer. After that, I would like you to

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:55.565
consider your answer, and tell me whether or not this makes sense.
