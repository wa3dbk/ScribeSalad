00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.932
For this problem, we also take a function 4 n squared, plus

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.500
log n to the seventh power plus 9 n times log n

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.440
squared plus n to the two thirds power. And state whether it's

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.030
a number of different sets. Specified by theta and big O notation.
