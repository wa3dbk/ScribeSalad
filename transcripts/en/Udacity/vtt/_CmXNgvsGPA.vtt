00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.980
Now, I'll run git push origin different-oil.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.250
As you saw before, pushing the branch updates the pull request.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.330
So, now the pull request can be automatically merged.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.220
If I look at the changed files within the pull request,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.570
I still only see my changes.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.500
That's because this view, only shows changes that are present in my branch, but

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470
not present in the master branch.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.130
And Sarah's changes are in both branches now.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.460
Finally, I'll leave another comment for Sarah, so

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.510
she'll know to take another look and make sure everything looks good now.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.250
That's because GitHub will email Sarah, if I leave this comment.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.500
But it actually, won't email her that I've updated the pull request, so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.160
I want to make sure she sees the update
