00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.090
One type of network IDS configuration,
is inline sensors.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.930
The primary motivation for
using inline sensors

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.620
is to enable them to block an attack,
when an attack is detected.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.600
That is, in such a case,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.280
an inline sensor performs both intrusion
detection and intrusion prevention.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.590
And of course, for
an inline sensor to be effective,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.570
it must be placed at a network point
where traffic must pass through it.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.610
We can deploy an inline sensor as
a combination of network ideas and

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.620
a firewall,
in a single piece of hardware.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.870
Or, we can deploy the inline sensor
as a stand alone, inline network IDS.
