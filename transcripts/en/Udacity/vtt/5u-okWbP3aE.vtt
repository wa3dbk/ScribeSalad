00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.040
The plus 1 in Kruchtens' 4 plus 1 is the use case view.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.240
Use cases are important execution sequences from the external actors or

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.220
user's point of view.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.170
We'll have a look at the use case diagram that UML offers.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.730
Some other UML diagrams that can be used to convey individual use cases.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.960
And we'll even see some structured text that can convey a use case.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.280
Here's a use case diagram from UML.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.210
Each of the ovals corresponds to a use case.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.040
The stick figures correspond to external actors.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.470
Some of the lines indicate are, are labeled and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.550
indicate that the particular use case is used for a special purpose such

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.760
as being included in another use case or being shared among several use cases.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.190
Important thing is that the use case diagram in UML conveys a set of use cases,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.570
not an individual use case.
