00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.486
Since we know that our area needs to be less than or equal to 750 square feet.

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:09.036
We can just replace area on the left side of this inequality with the other way

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:13.407
we know how to express it, length times width. And then, plugin those side

00:00:13.407 --> 00:00:18.117
lengths using these quantities down here. So the new length, of Grant's booth,

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:22.733
will be 20 feet, the original 20 feet, plus x, the amount that he's adding on.

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:28.064
So we have 20 plus x and then that's multiplying it by the new width, which will

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:33.101
be 15 plus x. This quantity will be the new area, which we know must be less

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:36.328
than or equal to 750. So here's our inequality.
