00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.719
So let's look at what lock synchronization looks like.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.128
So we said that a lock, or mutex is

00:00:06.128 --> 00:00:09.105
just a location in memory. So let's say that

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:12.488
we are using integers, to represent the lock structure. So

00:00:12.488 --> 00:00:16.110
really, a lock is just a number. We initialize

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.980
a lock variable. So you pass a lock variable to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.410
initialize to let's say a lock_init function. And what

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.272
it's going to do is set the lock. To an

00:00:25.272 --> 00:00:29.116
unlocked value, which, let's say that's 0. So pretty

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:31.997
much lock initialization is just write 0, to that

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:36.610
memory location that represents the lock. Zero means unlocked

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.070
in this case. And now the lock function, the function

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.120
that tries to acquire the lock and make sure

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.870
that we're alone in doing that. We'll do something

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.587
like this. It will spin, as long as the

00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:50.352
lock var is 1, which is the lock value and

00:00:50.352 --> 00:00:52.880
once it sees that lock var is 0 not 1,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.724
it's going to put 1 in that value, to mark

00:00:55.724 --> 00:00:58.884
it as locked, and then we can enter the critical

00:00:58.884 --> 00:01:02.202
section because others will now see our 1 and spin

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:05.519
there, and then to unlock, we will just, set the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.640
lock variable back to being free, once we do this.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.853
Coherence insures that whatever is waiting here, now sees a

00:01:12.853 --> 00:01:15.499
0 and acquires the log themselves, so we let them

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.320
go, into the critical section. But this log function

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.044
doesn't really work. Suppose you have two threads, the

00:01:23.044 --> 00:01:25.932
purple, and the green that come to this point

00:01:25.932 --> 00:01:29.488
at the same time. The log was initialized to

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:35.420
0, both of them read the log for the first time, see 0. Both of them exit this

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.040
loop because the lock var is not 1, so

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.640
both of them come here, write 1 to the lock

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.740
var, and then leave this lock function, and now both

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.070
of them are in the critical section, which is what we

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.056
were trying to prevent. What we really need to correctly implement

00:01:50.056 --> 00:01:53.251
the lock function, is that the looking at lock var and

00:01:53.251 --> 00:01:56.985
seeing 0. And the writing to Lock var of 1, needs

00:01:56.985 --> 00:02:00.135
to be atomic, which means we really need to do this

00:02:00.135 --> 00:02:03.135
in a critical section of its own to make sure that

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:05.835
when we see a 0, we end up writing 1 before

00:02:05.835 --> 00:02:11.152
anybody else gets to see a 0. Or at least, when we see a 0 we try to write 1,

00:02:11.152 --> 00:02:13.492
but we know if we were the one to write

00:02:13.492 --> 00:02:17.167
1 or if somebody did it before us. We should not

00:02:17.167 --> 00:02:21.260
write 1 if somebody succeeded in writing 1 before us.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.980
So we have some sort of a paradox here, in

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.500
that, we need locks here, in order to implement the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.160
lock function. So how do we ever support a lock function?

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.470
Because in order to have a working lock function we

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.630
really need to have a lock and an unlock here.
