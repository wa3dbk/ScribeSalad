00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.739
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; For this problem we're going to practice finding the x and y intercepts.

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:09.290
We're given an equation, 2x minus y equals 6. And we want to find the

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.467
x-intercept and the y-intercept. You can put your answers in these boxes as

00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:15.539
ordered pairs.
