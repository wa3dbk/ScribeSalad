The thing that we're squaring here is everything inside the parentheses. So, we

00:00:05.302 --> 00:00:10.681
just want to multiply 5xy cubed by itself. If we expand this multiplication and

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:15.412
then simplify, we end up with 25x squared y to the 6th. What we can see is that

00:00:15.424 --> 00:00:20.272
our end result here, takes each factor from the original quantity inside

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:26.448
parentheses and squares it. So, 5 squared is 25, x squared is x squared, y cubed

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.205
squared is y to the 6th. So, you can think of this as the exponent distributing

00:00:32.217 --> 00:00:37.271
to every single factor that's multiplied together inside the term.
