00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.460
So this required some guesswork, since we hadn't actually run

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.850
any examples this large. But if you understood the examples

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.970
we saw with the smaller inputs, you should have been

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.610
able to guess that it would take about a second to

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.410
do a look up for a table with ten million keywords. And the reason for this, if

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.540
we look at the previous executions, we saw, based on the keywords in the index,

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.900
the time increased linearly. So, when we had 10,000

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.280
keywords we measured the time as 0.0009 seconds. When

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.410
we had 100,000, we measured the time as 0.009

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.220
seconds. We didn't measure any times beyond that. The

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.410
suggestion from looking at this is, well when, when

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.620
we increased the number of keywords by ten, the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.990
time also increased by a factor of ten. So

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.080
maybe if we could guess, that if we had

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.484
a million keywords, it would probably take about 0.09

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:55.564
seconds, to do a look up. If we had

00:00:55.564 --> 00:01:00.460
ten million, the time would take 0.9 seconds, which

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.800
is close to one second. If we had a

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.900
100 million, then the time would take about nine seconds.
