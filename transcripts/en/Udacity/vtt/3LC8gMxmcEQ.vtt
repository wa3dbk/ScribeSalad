00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.414
Well, to get the first term in both of our answers, we just squared the first

00:00:04.414 --> 00:00:08.719
term, x times x is x squared, and 3x times 3x is 9x squared. So again we're

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.158
going to start off with a, a squared. We square the first term. This middle term

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:18.162
is just like from before except instead of being positive they're negative. So I

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:23.972
take the first term, multiply it by the second term, and then multiply it by 2.

00:00:23.972 --> 00:00:29.723
X times negative 4 is negative 4x times 2 is negative 8x. 3x times negative 1 is

00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:35.551
negative 3x times 2 is negative 6x. So, we take the first term,a, multiply it by

00:00:35.551 --> 00:00:41.380
the second term, negative b, and then multiply it by 2, and we get negative 2ab.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.896
This last part is simply this last term squared. Negative 4 times negative 4 is

00:00:46.896 --> 00:00:52.300
positive 16. Negative 1 times negative 1 is positive 1. So we know negative b

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.640
times negative b is positive b squared. There's our pattern.
