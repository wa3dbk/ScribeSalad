00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For this problem, we are to calculate the expected number of edges

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in an Erdos-Renyi graph with 256 nodes and a success probability of 0.25.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But before we answer that question, I want to look at a simpler question

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
where we have 4 nodes and a success probability of 1.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In the case where the success probability is 1, every possible edge will be created.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we'll have a complete graph. In the case of 4, we'll have 6 edges.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And we've already discussed that the number of edges in a clique with n nodes is n(n-1)/2.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
To get the expected number of edges when pâ‰&nbsp;1,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we have to multiply the total number of possible edges by p.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And so, in the original problem, we have n is 256 times n-1 is 255 divided by 2

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
times p that is 0.25, which is 8160.
