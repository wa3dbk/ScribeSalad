00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.050
One point I want to stress in the distinction between sketching with

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.300
the visualization and something like EDA is that exploratory data analysis is

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.830
typically performed, when you are exploring the structure and values of the data

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.320
to find insights, erroneous values or are there features of your dataset.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.390
That are inherent to the form of the data itself.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.530
Sketching in contrast is performed to experiment with

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.950
the visual display of the data and explore the best visual encodings for

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.770
the given data values and types.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.068
One last point about the distinction between something like EDA and sketching.

00:00:39.068 --> 00:00:43.660
Is the EDA is often thought of between yourself and the data.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.150
It's for you to discover insights in your data and

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.440
figure out the right questions to ask.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.480
Sketching, on the hand, is to communicate some insights to others.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.740
This is iterating and prototyping the best way to

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.410
visually display some insight that you have all ready found.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.340
This is somewhat similar to the distinction that the grammar of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.700
graphics makes between the data and the aesthetic.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.510
Think of sketching as iterating on the visual aesthetic, and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.630
EDA as iterating on the data, itself.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.310
Do you think a scatter plot is better suited for this data than a bar plot.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.620
Often people use a scatter plot to display time series and distributions.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.100
And while it can work for these types of things,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.700
just like a chef wouldn't use a butcher's knife to cut vegetables.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.550
I think that scatter plot is better suited for

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.350
data, where each field on the x axis is not correlated with itself.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.170
What do I mean by this exactly?

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.070
Well, given time,

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.330
one year is implicitly dependent on the year that came before it.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.080
A subtle distinction about why not to use a scatter plot for this data set.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.610
Is similar to a lot of the choices that front-end designers, make for

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.430
common user interface best practices.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.940
For example, it's very rare that you see a site with the horizontal scroll

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.640
going left to right rather than vertically up to down.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.460
If you've seen MySpace's new site redesign.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.330
You'll know that they're an exception, and the reason why sites often don't do

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.020
this is, because it can be very disorienting for a user, since 99% of sites,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.230
probably more out there, scroll vertically if a user scrolls the mouse up or

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.510
down rather than horizontally, and they come to expect this behavior for

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.580
every site.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.420
If a site maps scrolling up and down to actually horizontal action on the page,

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.620
from left and right.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.850
It's not wrong or incorrect, but simply just unconventional.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.180
And in this same vein, if people come to know a scatter plot

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.700
to represent data where the x values are uncorrelated and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.870
independent, they might assume that the data that you've chosen to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.840
represent by a scatter plot has x values that are independent and uncorrelated.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.070
So in this case, a scatter plot actually succumbs to the same issues as

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.390
the bar plot, and actually doesn't highlight the missing data as well.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.030
So it might be even a little worse in my opinion.
