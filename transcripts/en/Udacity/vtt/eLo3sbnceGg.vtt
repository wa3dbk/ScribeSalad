00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.860
Okay, let's do step two now, which is to

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.010
rename files. Now, I provided the link to the

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.750
documentation for the module OS in the instructor notes.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.500
I want you to scan that documentation and find

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.960
out which function we can use to rename files.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.130
By the way, this sort of a search is

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.860
done quite commonly by Software Engineers. Once you've found

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.560
that function Enter the name of that function in

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.320
the box provided.
