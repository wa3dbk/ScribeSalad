00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Even though the overall equation is simple, there's two things to be careful about.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
First, you cannot write 1/3 because that would be 0.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Integer divided by integer would be an integer so you have to put in at least one decimal point here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The second thing to be careful about is Python's power operator.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If you forget the parenthesis here, it would be forming the first power

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and would be dividing the result by 3, which is not what we want obviously, and here's the result.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you start with an initial value of 0, the results stays at 0 all of the time,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but if we start with a positive number that's ever so slightly above 0, such as 10⁻³⁰⁰,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we get a completely different evolution

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and as you can see, there's hardly any difference between starting with 10⁻³⁰⁰

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and starting with 0.01.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
From a numerical view point, this differential equation looks as though

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
0 is a highly unstable fixed point.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Once you get a tiny bit above 0, the solution is going to quickly divert from that

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and mathematically speaking, this is a differential equation whose solution curves are not unique.

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
If you start with 0, you will branch off at any point in time in this fashion and get another solution.
