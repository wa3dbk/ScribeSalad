00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.560
Back in the day using a computer
monitor was dangerous business.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.100
It meant sitting without
flinching while an electron gun

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.940
shot charged particles at your
face at nearly the speed of light.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.830
Only to have them slam into a thin
layer of glass covered in poison.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.305
Depending on where and
how many electrons were shot at you,

00:00:17.305 --> 00:00:20.287
they would produce explosions of
different colors and brightnesses.

00:00:20.287 --> 00:00:24.700
Which your eyes would see as
an adorable paperclip, or whatever.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.440
This system is called
a cathode ray tube, and

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.160
it was the bane of LAN
parties everywhere.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.320
Since the screen is a big rectangle, and

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.780
the electron gun can only paint
one dot of color at a time,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.540
the gun had to traverse the whole
screen many times a second.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.330
Well I'm sure you can think of many
cool space villan curves that would

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.940
get the job done.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.570
The chosen solution was a lot simpler.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.690
The chosen solution was to divide
the screen into horizontal scan lines.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.530
Much like the lines in a book.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.450
And the traverse the lines
from top to bottom.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.200
This was called Raster scanning.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.970
&gt;From the Latin Rastrum, or rake.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.780
It's like raking a zen garden, but

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.410
instead of having a rake with many tines
you have to draw each line individually.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.040
The roster scan implies that
the colors in the screen have to be

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.480
laid out in a rectangular grid.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.540
While this might seem obvious,
it didn't necessarily have to be so.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.660
You can certainly imagine
a hexagonal grid of colors, and

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.180
that might well have been better from
a human perception point of view.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.980
Turns out though that the math
of drawing to a hex grid is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.910
super frustrating, so maybe it's best
we stuck with rectangular grids.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.930
So ultimately, for a computer to draw

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.230
it constructs a two dimensional array of
colors and memory and ships those colors

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.440
to whatever device is going to be
ultimately displaying the colors.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.940
Be that a monitor, a projector, or
some sweet virtual reality device.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.770
Note that these roster elements are also
referred to as picture elements, or

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.600
pixels, for short.
