00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Each of these things can cause more errors. The answer is all of them marked.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The poll being taken before the election can certainly affect its accuracy because

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
sentiments shift over time.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Some being under-represented in the samples.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Certainly, if voters who favor one candidate versus another are under or over-represented

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
that will change the results.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Similarly if we tend to have people who are more likely to vote

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
represented the same as those who are less likely to vote,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
they're not being over-represented enough.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So these two things ideally should be linked.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And in a well-designed poll, they try to do this although it's hard to do this perfectly.

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And responses that differ of course will cause additional error.
