00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the answer is we need to find the second element of countries,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
so that's this element.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Remember that lists are indexed starting from 0,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so to find the entry corresponding to India,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we need to find the entry at position 1.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The result of countries[1] will be the element of countries at that position,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which is the list containing 3 elements,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the string India, the string Delhi,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and the value 1210, which is the population of 1.2 billion people.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
To select the capital, that's the second element of that list,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
so we use index 1 again to get that element,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the value of countries[1][1] will be Delhi.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And then we can just use print to print that out.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's try that in the interpreter.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, running countries[1] will give us the element of countries

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that corresponds to India.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And then to get the capital, we select element 1 from that.
