00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.090
Now we're going to look at two main concepts in ROC analysis.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.650
The first one is the Iso Performance Lines.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.140
The idea here is very simple.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.770
If you draw a line through ROC space, then the points

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.210
in the ROC Cuves that intersect with the straight line have the same

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.930
performance and this performance is measured by the slope of this line.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.280
The gray line that I drew, intersected the ROC curves in one,

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.355
two, three, four, five, points.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.580
All these points have the same performance and

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.240
that's the fall on iso performance line.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.780
So you see these lines can be determined by the objective of optimization,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.530
such as the lines that can give maximum accuracy or specificity or sensitivity.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.500
Another important concept is the concept of the area under the curve.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.700
An ROC curve with a larger area under it performs better on

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.490
average than and ROC curves that has a smaller area.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.320
In our case here you see the green line has

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.240
a lesser area than the red line under it.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.730
Thus, the SVC performs better than the logistic regression.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.160
Since a greater AUC, or area under the curve, implies better performance.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.200
In our case we choose the random forest classifier as it

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.990
performs best on average given the area under the curve is the greatest.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.250
One very interesting property of the ROC curve is that is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.790
invariant under the class distribution, and thus the results are applicable

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.650
to a dataset with different proportion of class instances.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.950
What this means is that it doesn't matter, as far as the ROC analysis goes,

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.730
as to which class has how many points to train upon.
