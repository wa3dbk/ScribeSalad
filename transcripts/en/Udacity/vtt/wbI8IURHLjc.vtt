00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.705
Our equation would be 30 divided by x plus 4 equals 15 divided by x. Great

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:10.682
thinking if you found this. Again the key works here are in the same time. We

00:00:10.682 --> 00:00:17.006
know Olivia can bike 30 miles in the same time that Terrance can go 15. So,

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.974
since we have expressions for time, for those two distances, we can set these

00:00:20.974 --> 00:00:23.600
times equal to one another.
