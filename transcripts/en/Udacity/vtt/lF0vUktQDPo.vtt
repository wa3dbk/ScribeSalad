00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.510
Graphs have some additional
properties that make them useful for

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.980
modeling various types of data.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.150
Edges can have a direction, meaning
the relationship between two nodes only

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.890
applies one way and not the other.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.990
Directed graph is the term for

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.770
a graph where the edges
have a sense of direction.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.170
For example, if you're using a graph
to represent travel plans, a directed

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.970
edge can be used to show which city
you start in and which you travel to.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.240
Often one node will be the start and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.839
the other the end of the relationship or
action taking place.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.980
You might describe the edge of
a graph as the first node, a verb,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.449
the word to, and the other node.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.610
Here, it's, From SF, travel to Tokyo.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.570
If you make a round trip and travel
through the same two cities going in

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.490
opposite directions, you might have
two edges between the same two nodes,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.390
one representing each
direction you travel in.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.540
An undirected graph has edges
with no sense of direction.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.110
For example, if you have a graph of
people and edges are drawn between two

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.840
people who have met before,
directed edges might be unnecessary.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.390
I previously mentioned that graphs
can have cycles but trees can't.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.830
A cycle happens in a graph when
you can start at one node and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.800
follow edges all the way
back to that node.

Cycles in

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.759
graphs can be really dangerous
when you're describing algorithms.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.200
You might write some code to travel
through the nodes in your graph.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.000
But if you have a cycle, you might just
go through the same sequence again and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.160
again and again in an infinite loop.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.850
You often need to make sure the graph
you're taking in as input is acyclic,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.530
meaning it has no cycles.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.770
One type that shows up often is a dag,
or directed, acyclic graph.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.800
It's really just what it sounds like,
a directed graph with no cycles.
