00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.760
Now this course isn't about vagrant or
virtual machines.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.280
That was just some overhead
work you needed to accomplish

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.720
to get to this point.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.930
You're now logged into a Linux box.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.920
Whenever you get to this prompt,
I want you to ignore all of that

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.270
virtual machines and
vagrant stuff as much as possible.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.800
Yes technically this computer is
just a virtual machine sitting on

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.000
your computer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
But that's not too different than what
you'll be doing as you start setting up

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.820
your own web servers.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.570
Most likely you'll be given
a virtual machine from a service

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.010
provider like Amazon.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.540
And you're log in to it via SSH.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.590
This experience is pretty much the same
as what you have configured now

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.240
on your computer.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.670
You are remotely connected to
a completely different computer.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.990
What does that mean?

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.040
You can do anything
here on this machine.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.500
And it will have no lasting
impact on your personal computer.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.510
Remember, this is an entirely
different computer.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.720
You can turn it off.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.840
Throw it away.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.590
Rebuild it any time you want.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.300
So I want you to have no fear
when SSHed into that computer.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.640
You will not break
anything on your computer.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.970
Now, let's get comfortable with this new
computer, your Linux virtual machine.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.720
And see how it organizes all of
the files you'll be working with.
