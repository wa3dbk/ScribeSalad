00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.906
Well, we can easily see that ten students are from the US. To find out how many

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:11.284
students are from the US, China, or Pakistan, we'll just add 10 plus 1 plus 12,

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:17.291
which is 23. And finally, the two countries with the fewest students look like

00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:22.728
they're Pakistan and Sweden. See how easy it is to quickly analyze data when

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.864
it's organized in a coherent way? By doing so, we can quickly describe data, see

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:28.565
patterns, and make decisions.
