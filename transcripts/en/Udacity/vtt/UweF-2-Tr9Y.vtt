00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.770
We want to be able to calculate
the total value of a portfolio

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.790
day by day by day.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.160
Once we have that information,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.770
then we can compute statistics
on the overall portfolio.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.170
So let's start with an example.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.900
Assume we start with a portfolio
value of one million dollars, and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.950
we're going to take a look
at that portfolio from

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.890
the beginning of 2009
to the end of 2011.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.060
And our portfolio consists of
these three symbols, S&amp;P 500,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.760
XOM, Google, and Gold.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.878
And at the beginning of 2009,
we're going to allocate .4 or

00:00:38.878 --> 00:00:44.657
40% of our portfolio to SPY,
40% to XOM, 10% to Google, and

00:00:44.657 --> 00:00:50.154
10% to Gold, and we'll enter
those positions in the beginning,

00:00:50.154 --> 00:00:53.754
and we'll hold them,
and step forward, and

00:00:53.754 --> 00:00:59.150
see what the overall value of
the portfolio is day by day.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.020
How do we calculate the total
value of the portfolio day by day?

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.870
Here's how to do it step by step.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.500
We start with our prices data frame.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.360
Remember the four columns with
prices every day, indexed by date.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.120
The first step is to
normalize these prices.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.220
As we've done before, it is just the
price values divided by the first row.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.399
So after we normalize, we have
a new data frame, normed, which is,

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.580
as we said,
all the prices divided by the first row.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.440
That's going to give us now this
new data frame where the first row

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.570
all 1.0 and then it proceeds after that.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.480
And these are essentially cumulative
returns starting from the start date.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.560
The next step is to multiply
these normed values

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.600
by the allocations to
each of the equities.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.950
So we'll just multiply normed
times our allocations, allocs, and

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.560
that gives us a new data frame alloced.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.172
Now as you remember,
our allocations were 0.4, 0.4, 0.1, 0.1.

00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:09.538
So when we do that multiplication,

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:12.410
the first row is going to
represent those numbers.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.350
And the data after the first
row will be sized accordingly.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.730
Our next step is to multiply our
alloc data frame times start_val.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.590
And what that'll give us is,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.310
in this first row the amount of
cash allocated to each asset and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.080
then going forward, it'll show us
the value of that asset over time.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.880
So we've got now a new data frame,
pos_vals, what that means is position

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.870
values, that at each day,
that's how much that position is worth.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.110
So we started out, for instance, with
400,000 for the first one, 400,000 for

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.957
the second one, 100,000, 100,000.

00:02:51.957 --> 00:02:56.426
But now as we go forward each day,
it's as if we invested say

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:59.860
100,000 in this one, and it reflects how
much it was worth each day after that.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.030
Now that we have the value each day for
the individual assets, we can calculate

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.670
the total value for the portfolio
each day by summing across each day.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.770
So on the first day for

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.460
instance the value of the portfolio was
four hundred thousand plus four hundred

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.430
thousand plus one hundred plus one
hundred thousand or one million.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.360
Now those values change of course as
the stock prices change going forward.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.340
So each day is a little bit different.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.254
We can calculate the value for
each of these days by taking the sum

00:03:32.254 --> 00:03:36.710
of pos_vals,
position vals using axis=1, so

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:43.270
that's telling python to sum
across each row like that.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.660
So that sums each day
across into Port_val,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.390
which now reflects the value each
day for our total portfolio.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.690
Let's recap now.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.290
We start with our prices.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.220
We normalize that to the first day,
so the first row here is all ones.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:08.510
We multiply it times our allocations,
and that gives us now in each column,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.300
the relative value of each
of those aspects over time.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.839
We multiply by our initial investment,
and

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.200
that causes now each row to be
the real value of that investment

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.370
each day over time,
starting with our initial allocations.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.010
If we then sum each row

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.710
we get the value of the portfolio on
each corresponding day, and that's it.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.410
That's how you calculate
daily portfolio value.
