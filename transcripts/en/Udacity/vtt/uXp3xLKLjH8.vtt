00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.480
Most concisely, an operating system contains code to access the physical

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.930
resources, that is contained in a computer system, and arbitrate among competing

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.400
requests for those hardware resources, coming

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.040
from multiple applications that may be

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.410
running simultaneously on the processing platform.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.660
So in other words, the operating

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.850
system is just a program, like any other program you may have written. Okay,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.170
slightly more complex than a hello world

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.360
program, I'm being facetious here, intentionally. But you

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.760
get the point. It's a matter of climbing the latter of programming, just like,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.890
a ball player may start from t-ball to little league to the minor league and

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.740
then to majors, you can also do it. If Microsoft can do it, you can do it. If

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.950
you can write a hello, world program today, you can eventually write an

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.860
entire operating system. So what the operating system provides are well-defined

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.930
APIs for accessing the hardware resources that are managed by the operating

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.220
system. And these resources are provided as operating

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.130
system services through this well defined interfaces, and an application may

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.440
make a request to the operating system for such hardware resources through this

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.480
well defined api interface. And the application, via the response from the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.910
operation system gets the services from

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.900
the operating system via these API codes.
