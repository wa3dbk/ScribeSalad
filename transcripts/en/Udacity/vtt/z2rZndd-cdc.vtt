00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.530
For this question, you need to add a layer to this

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.320
plot to make the months be discrete. To do this, we

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.570
can add our scale_x_discrete layer. We're going to pass it the parameter

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.700
breaks, and set the breaks from zero to 203. Now I'm

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.160
going to step every 12 months. Since 12 months is a

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.380
year. And you might be wondering how I decided upon 203.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.160
If I type in range mitchell month I can see. The

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.950
range of the month variable and it runs from zero to 203.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.990
So this is my lower limit. And my upper limit. We can run this code

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.520
and we'd get a little bit of a better plot with our months in discrete units.
