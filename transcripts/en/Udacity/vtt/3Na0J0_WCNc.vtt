00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.550
Let's assume that we have a single

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.630
autonomous system with static link weights as shown.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.190
In such a setup, routers will flood

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.710
information to one another to learn the network

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.560
topology, including the link weights on, links

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.730
connecting individual routers. An operator can affect how

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.950
traffic flows through the network. By configuring the

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.900
link weights. By changing the link weight configuration,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.970
an operator can affect the shortest path between

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.290
two points in this graph. Thus, affecting the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.280
way that traffic flows. In the link weight

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.560
settings shown here, traffic would flow along the green

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.660
path. Suppose that the operator would like to

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.080
shift traffic off of a congested link in the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.580
middle of the network. Such as this one.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.870
By changing the link weight from one to three.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.407
The shortest path between this node and this node,

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:56.970
now takes an alternate route. So we can see

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.530
from this simple example, That, by adjusting the link

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.160
weights in a intra-domain topology, the operator can affect

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.500
how traffic flows between different points in the network,

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.280
thus affecting the load on the network links. In

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.600
practice, network operators set these link weights in a

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.150
variety of ways. One could set the link weights

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.760
inversely proportional to capacity. Proportional to propagation delay, or the

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.920
operator might perform some network wide optimization, based on traffic.
