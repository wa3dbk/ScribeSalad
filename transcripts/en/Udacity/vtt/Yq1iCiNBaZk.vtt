00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.950
And here's the code that we use to do that.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.445
Now, you might remember formattedName from before.

00:00:06.445 --> 00:00:08.427
And we added formattedRole.

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:15.061
Now, to create our formattedRole, we took HTMLheaderRole.replace,

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:21.940
and we replaced the data placeholder with the role that we created up here.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.400
So, this next bit of code is a little bit tricky.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.740
So, over here we have our header div.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.950
We can see that header already has an unorder list inside of it.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.600
So, if we append the data, it would actually put the data right here.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.580
We want it to show at the beginning of our header tag, right here.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.760
In order to add elements to the beginning,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.350
we actually need to use prepend instead of append.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.240
So, we want our name to appear first and our role to appear second.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.060
So running through this code, when we append our formattedRole,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.739
it'll show up at the top here.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.000
And then when we prepend our name, instead of showing it

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.290
at the end as append would, it will insert it in the beginning.
