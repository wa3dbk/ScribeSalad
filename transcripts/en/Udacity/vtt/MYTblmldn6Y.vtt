So the first thread is thread Id 0 in CUDA.

00:00:03.412 --> 00:00:10.880
Inside the if statement, you want to check if my thread Id is 0 which is comparing thread Idx.x to 0.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.890
In this case, only thread 0 will launch that kernel, and it will only get 1 kernel launch

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.890
no matter how many threads I've launched in my block.
