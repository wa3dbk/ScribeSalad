00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.630
Okay let's look at the solution for this. So the question is in what cycle is

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.315
this instruction dispatched? Well, that instruction is waiting for ROB1.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:15.370
ROB1 is going to be broadcasting cycle 12, value four will be broadcast then and

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.540
at that point, we will also dispatch this. Remember that when we capture a value

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.390
and that's the last value, that's the cycle in which we dispatch and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.940
we begin executing in the following cycle. So, the cycle in which we dispatch,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.980
the cycle 12 because that's when we captured the result, and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.329
this instruction, the ROB4 instruction, begins executing in cycle 13.
