00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.175
The most robust way to do this would be to set the 0 value to 10, and then to

00:00:04.175 --> 00:00:10.372
set the last value to 10 use values.length and subtract 1. Instead of writing

00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:16.059
values of values.length minus 1 we could have written values of 9 equals 10.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.419
This is a good answer too but it will only work if the array has exactly ten

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.710
elements in it. This one will work for any size of array
