00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.170
These days, we understand
a lot about human behavior.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.970
For example,
our eyes are naturally drawn to motion.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.760
If something is moving while
everything around it stays the same,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.750
we're naturally drawn to
the thing that's moving.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.220
This is a powerful tool in UI design,
really useful for directing

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.970
your user's attention to an important or
immediately relevant UI element.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580
But that's just the beginning.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.920
We saw in lesson two, that shadows
can tell you a lot about a surface.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.570
Well, how that surface moves can
actually tell you a whole lot about

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.810
it as well.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.340
More specifically, an object's motion

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.960
can provide important cues about
how you could interact with it.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.430
Let's take a look.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.890
Take a look at this example of tabs.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.280
Okay, now take a look at this one.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:47.850
Can you tell the difference?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.230
Here they are side by side.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.530
In both cases pressing on the tab
at the top changes to that tab.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.200
But, in the second example, a little
slide animation is used to switch tabs.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.860
This subtle animation helps communicate
that you can actually swipe the tabs

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410
to switch between them.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.580
We call this instructive motion.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.380
Without this kind of instructive motion,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.350
it would be less likely that users
would discover this behavior,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.000
as the spatial relationship
between pages would be less clear.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.960
In this example, as the music
player controls move into view,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.170
notice how the volume
control slides into place.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.950
This animation provides a subtle cue
that the user can move the slider,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.690
horizontally, along the track.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.610
And remember in Lesson 2 how we talked
about the elevations of surfaces and

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.405
how they can imply what
happens upon scrolling?

00:01:42.405 --> 00:01:46.898
Well changes in elevation could help
communicate changes in interaction.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:51.430
When two surfaces are adjacent like here
at the same elevation they might move

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.420
together, but at some point one
surface might change its elevation

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.490
to communicate that it now moves
independently of the other one.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.120
The way that content enters the scene
can also imply ways to interact with it.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.669
In this example, the bottom sheet enters
from the bottom of the screen, implying

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.160
that it can be dragged upward or
dismissed by dragging it back downward.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.900
In all these examples of instructive
motion, you can see that how something

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.220
moves can give you plenty of hints
about how you can interact with it.
