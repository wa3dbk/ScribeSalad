00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.510
The qualities that
investors are looking for

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.790
in a company I think can boil
down to three questions.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.580
The first is, is the market big enough?

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.790
Is there enough opportunity out there
for a company to go out and succeed?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.081
The second question is,

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:17.958
is the problem that you're trying to
solve something that's important?

00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.524
Is it something that a lot of
people believe is an actual problem

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:22.948
that needs to be solved?

00:00:22.948 --> 00:00:24.310
And the third thing is,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.250
is your company best positioned to solve
that problem better than anybody else?

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.390
And you have to ask yourself
those three questions.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.880
There's one other thing
you have to look at.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.860
And that is that for early stage
investors, they're looking for

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.030
a 20 to 100 return on their money.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.320
And when you think about your problem
and you think about taking money and

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.570
what you will ultimately be
able to return, you have to ask

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.820
yourself the question, can you return
that much money to the investor?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.395
And if you can't,
then you probably need to go back and

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:56.220
re-evaluate the problem that
you're trying to solve.
