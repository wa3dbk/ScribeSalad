00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.971
It turns out we can. The numerator would be eleven and the denominator would be

00:00:04.971 --> 00:00:08.925
X minus six times X plus six. Great job, if you've figured that one out. When I

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.800
look at this numerator and these two terms, I can see they share a common factor

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.966
of eleven. If we factor eleven out of our numerator, we'll get eleven times X

00:00:17.966 --> 00:00:22.195
plus two. Now we can see this X plus two is a factor and the numerator. Add in

00:00:22.195 --> 00:00:27.815
the denominator, which means we can simplify. These factors cancel to 1, and

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:31.876
we're left with 11 divided by x minus 6 times x plus 6.
