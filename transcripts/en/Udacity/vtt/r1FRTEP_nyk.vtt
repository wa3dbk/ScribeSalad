00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
For this problem we have 6 graphs,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and we want you to order them with a clustering coefficient

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of the red node of each graph.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Order them from the lowest clustering coefficient to the highest clustering coefficient.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
For example, if you think f has the lowest clustering coefficient

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
put that first and then maybe b, e, a, c, d.
