00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.744
Here the answer should be the quantity x minus 3 squared. Great pattern

00:00:04.744 --> 00:00:09.182
recognition if you figured that one out. We can see that the first and last

00:00:09.182 --> 00:00:14.730
terms are perfect squares, x squared is x squared and 3 squared is 9. This term

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.010
is negative which fits my negative sign in the factoring pattern, so I'll have x

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.580
squared minus 2x times 3 plus 3 squared. The a is really x and the b is really

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.878
3. I know I can factor this using a minus b squared, so I just write

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:34.675
parentheses, x minus 3 squared. The one thing we want to notice is that, if this

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:39.060
term is positive, then we use a positive in the squared binomial. If this term

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.383
is negative, then we use a negative sign in our factored form.
