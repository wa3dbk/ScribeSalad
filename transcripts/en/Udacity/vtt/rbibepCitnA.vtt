00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.940
Another example here mosaicing.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.640
Now we've talked about mosaicing before.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.420
We talked about panoramas about aligning
images and bringing them together.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.300
Well instead of just a small
discreet set of images,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.500
suppose you actually have a video.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.830
So you're taking your camera and
you're panning it around.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.660
What you might want to do
is make a single image.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.620
Okay?
And this comes from

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.940
Michael Irani's work.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.070
Of where you can see
where all the frames are.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.400
Okay you can sort of see these,
this jagged line,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.560
each one being the edge of a frame.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.802
And you realize what happened is the,
the camera was swept out this way.

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:34.928
All right, and
I'm able to make this single image.

00:00:34.928 --> 00:00:39.310
All right, and If I'm rotating

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.060
my camera about its axis,
I'm not actually doing any translating.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.790
The reconstruction can be
perfect because I don't have any

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.270
motion parallax.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
And if these things are planes
I have to align some points.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.110
How many points does it take?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.280
It's a homography question.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.650
That's right,
even Megan got four points for that.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.730
And in fact, if I am moving, but

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.170
things are really on a plane,
it's still, four points.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.080
So there are other applications
of motion analysis.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.610
You know,
segmenting objects in space or time.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.450
Sometimes you can get
the 3-dimensional structure

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.560
if you know how the points are moving,
you know which point is which.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.290
Just like when you saw the person.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.630
You might want to learn the dynamics
of how some things move.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.650
Maybe you're doing, physiology.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.430
And you're watching people moving, and
you want to understand something about

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.770
their gait, and
the dynamics of their gait.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.460
All right?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.150
Recognizing events and activities.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.690
You'd like to be able to say,
what just happened in the video?

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.520
So it's not just object recognition,
it's action recognition.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.900
And finally, you might just
want to process the video and

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.590
understand the motion
to improve the quality.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.540
So you might do motion stabilization,
right, so that you've

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.480
got this jerky camera and you'd like
to get a nice smooth video out.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.260
There are simple ways of doing that and
complicated ways.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.480
In fact,
a colleague of mine here Irfanisa and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.160
a former, student of mine Veroquatra and
some others did some work on

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.320
stabilizing video especially when you
have rolling shutters in cell phones.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.760
Anyway, these are all reasons for
wanting to process motion.
