00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.350
We had said that the title of this
lesson is Common Sense Reasoning, but

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.670
let's dig a little bit deeper so

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.650
that we can see where the common
sense reasoning is coming here.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.482
Consider the sentence,
Ashok put the wedge on the block.

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:13.845
Imagine an agent that
pulls out the frame for

00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:17.730
move-object with a primitive action and
fills in all of these slots.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.540
And by now we know how
the agent can do that.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.980
I were to ask the agent,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.830
did Ashok's hand move when he was
putting the wedge on the block?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.110
I would expect the agent to say,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.130
yes, because that is what happens when
people move the wedge to the block.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.050
They grasp their hands around the wedge,
they move their hand,

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.880
then they release their fingers.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.720
Now this is what common sense
reasoning is about, making inferences

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.370
that are not necessarily part
of the input sentence here, but

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.790
are part of the background
knowledge that the agent has.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.467
So the agent can make
inferences about the world,

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:51.770
common sense inferences about the world.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.512
So the question then becomes, what is
the knowledge that an agent must have so

00:00:55.512 --> 00:00:59.253
that it can, in fact, make the kind of
inferences that we are talking about,

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:00.597
common sense inferences?

00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:04.406
Suppose that the agent had not only
knowledge of the primitive action

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:07.660
move-object, but
also about some of the sub-actions.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.760
So here are some of the sub-actions for
the human context.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.743
So in the context of moving wedges and
blocks,

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:17.195
the agent might already
have a kind of micro-story.

00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:19.786
Which says that when
actions get done and

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:22.985
things get moved from one
place to another place,

00:01:22.985 --> 00:01:27.420
then typically fingers are first
closed around the first object.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.120
Then the hand moves and the fingers
are released around the second object.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.971
&gt;&gt; So Ashok, if we can decompose
move-object into a series of

00:01:33.971 --> 00:01:38.110
move-body-part actions, was
move-object really a primitive action?

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.365
&gt;&gt; That's a valid question, David.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:44.150
Move-object was indeed a primitive
action related to the various

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.120
superficial forms in which words can
occur in a sentence, as an example,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.320
transported, carried, or moved.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.780
However, this primitive action
move-object can have its own story

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.080
in terms of further decomposition.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.590
Notice this particular decomposition,
this particular story is specific to

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.840
the structure of the sentence where
Ashok puts the wedge on the block.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.720
This raises lots of hard issues.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.389
How many such stories are there?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.889
Do we have a story?

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.180
Must an agent have such a story for

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.230
every single situation
that it encounters?

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.355
Those are hard questions, and

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:20.610
it's not clear that currently hasn't
answered all of those questions.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.399
So this theory by no
means covers all stories,

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.770
many of the stories are beyond
the scope of this theory.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.488
And in fact, even for
the stories that are within this scope,

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:32.209
there is a hard question about
computational tractability,

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.840
because a number of such stories
can explode very quickly.
