00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.812
So, now let's look at the brain and what happens when we're engaging in short

00:00:02.812 --> 00:00:06.916
term or working memory. Here we see that the prefrontal cortex focuses

00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:11.076
attention on a sensory stimuli, and will hold the information long enough for

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:16.663
us to solve the problem at hand. Then it will transfer the information to the

00:00:16.663 --> 00:00:20.982
hippocampus for memory consolidation. We also know that the encoding stage of

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:25.315
memory is consolidated through rehearsal and repetition. So, if we repeatedly

00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:29.150
fire the neural impulses that are necessary to convert a short term memory to a

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.196
long term memory, this will occur in the hippocampus. Now, the main reason

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:39.344
Henry Molaison or HM, could no longer form long term memories is because a

00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:44.424
large part of his hippocampus was removed. But as I said, we know that the

00:00:44.424 --> 00:00:48.796
hippocampus isn't the only thing that's important for working memory. We also

00:00:48.796 --> 00:00:52.111
need our prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for our ability to maintain

00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.399
attention and focus. So, when you're reading, having a conversation or looking

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.739
at a map. When trying to figure out directions, it's our prefrontal cortex that

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.375
allows us to keep this information available. Do you remember earlier in the

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:10.020
lesson when we discussed the visuospatial sketchpad in phonological loop? Well,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.548
we see that in each of these areas is where brain activity occurs during each

00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:18.167
of these processes. So, we know that auditory input is processed and rehearsed

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:22.930
in the phonological loop from the prefrontal cortex. To the language

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.470
comprehension center, which is located to the back and left part of the

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.389
parietal lobes. We call this language comprehension center, the Wernicke's

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.328
region, after the person who discovered it. You may remember this when we

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:39.471
talked about it in lesson three. As for visual information in the visuo spatial

00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:44.094
sketchpad, it goes from the prefrontal cortex to the temporal lobes for spatial

00:01:44.094 --> 00:01:50.788
information. And then to the occipital lobe for visual information. Now, we

00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:54.180
know that our explicit memory storage are stored in the respective cortex in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.100
the area that it was originally processed. Now, other types of memories such as

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.455
implicit memories are stored in structures of the subcortex, specifically the

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.845
striatum, amygdala and cerebellum.
