00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.100
Memcached is a very fast in-memory cache. It was built

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.730
by a company called Danja, to power a website called

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.230
LiveJournal. And before Facebook took over the world, LiveJournal was

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.910
a very popular site where people had you know, their

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.090
own blogs. Kind of like Tumblr or Blogspot. I don't

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.240
know a bunch of, a bunch of things have, have

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.670
risen to take the, the place of LiveJournal. But LiveJournal

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.750
was a very popular site back in the day. And when

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.540
I say back in the day, I mean 2003 is when memcache was released. Now just

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.862
about every website on the internet uses memcache

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:37.030
these days. I don't know about Google but

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.890
certainly it's used by Facebook. It's used by

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.910
Reddit. You know, it's used by YouTube. Twitter,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.000
it is an essential piece of software when

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.940
you're writing web applications. And in fact other than,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.470
than Linux itself memcache is probably the piece of software

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.730
that's, most in common between every website online. It's, it's pretty

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.710
astounding. It's very, very simple. And it's very, very effective

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.860
at what it does. Okay. To draw a bigger version of

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.920
that picture I did on the quiz, how memcached fits

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
in, it looks something like this. Memcached is a process. Often

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.290
you run it on its own machine. But you can also

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.340
run it on the machines with your APP servers, and it's

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.960
a very simple system. The algorithm doesn't change. A request

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.490
comes in we check memcached. If a response is there, we

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.540
send it back to the user. If it isn't there

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.530
we check the database instead. And right to memcached, you know.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.500
As we've been doing, the algorithm should be pretty familiar

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.760
to you by now. What's handy about it, is that all

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.350
of these apps servers can interact with memcached. Memcached is

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.460
fast enough and can support many, many sockets that it works

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.122
very well in this scenario. Also most memcached libraries have built

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:49.030
in towards this notion of having multiple memcached machines. Because memcached

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.500
is just a key value store. Just, it's like basically a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.220
giant hash table. You can hash on the keys to decide which

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.950
server to send your data to. And because it's a cache

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.590
it's okay if you, you know, lose data from time to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.110
time because you'll just get it, you'll get the authoritative copy

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.860
out of the database. And this distribution of keys over multiple servers

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.190
is gnereally handled by the library. You know, sometimes you have to

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.270
do it yourself. But most libraries and the Python library we'll be

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.980
using, and this class this abstracts all of this for you so

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.720
you don't have to deal with it. It's very common to actually

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.860
run a little memcache server on each machine, and then have each

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.640
app server you know, communicate to all the caches. You kind of get

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.920
this big ball of this big ball of connections. But everything works

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.970
out okay so. And mem cache is a very simple protocol and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.520
the operations it does are very simple. So, ultimately we're going to

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.960
be storing you know keys to values. Where the keys and

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.670
values are both strings. And the operations look something like this.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.520
We've got set and this takes a key and a value. And

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.560
we've got get, this takes a key and returns a value.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.780
And we've got delete, which takes a key and deletes the key.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.490
There are other operations and there are actually a few other

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.170
parameters here. But these are the basic ones, and you can see

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.460
what these three main operations, set, get, and delete, we could

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.300
actually implement all of the caching we've been doing in ASCIIchan

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.580
in a system that will scale a lot better than having,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.720
you know, just a dictionary in our process. It also means

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.090
that if, the advantage you get from using memcaches if our

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.070
process restarts, we don't have an empty dictionary anymore, we have

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.930
our memcached and, and our content lives on. So, what I'd

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.390
like you to do first, is implement a fake version of memcached.
