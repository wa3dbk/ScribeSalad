00:00:00.064 --> 00:00:03.074
And the answer, of course, is that modern DRAM systems

00:00:03.074 --> 00:00:08.191
such as the ones used by high-performance GPUs transfer large chunks of data per transaction,

00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:12.082
and therefore, if you can coalesce your memory request by many threads

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:17.819
that are performing a transaction at the same time, then you'll get many more useful bytes out of that transaction.

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:23.021
So the second statement, that DRAM systems transfer data in many small chunks, is simply false,

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:29.538
and the third statement, that GPUs have no on-chip caches to prefetch data, that's also false.

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.900
Modern GPUs do have on-chip caches,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.183
although it is the case that prefetching data is not a particularly effective strategy for GPUs.

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:41.878
The caches are quite small considering the number of threads that are trying to use them,

00:00:41.878 --> 00:00:47.083
and so you can't really afford to speculatively load data that some thread might use.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:51.254
Okay, you have tens of thousands of threads that are actually trying to use those caches to hold data,

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:54.722
so prefetching is not an effective strategy, and this is also not a correct answer.
