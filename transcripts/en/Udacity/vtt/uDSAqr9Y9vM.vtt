00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And obviously the new mean is 1.2 times the old mean because we're multiplying

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
everything up by 20% raise that makes a factor of 1.2 over here and zero over here

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
because we don't really add a constant amount of money per person its variable.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a multiplicative change. For the variance it's more interesting.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In our new variance, we multiply each salary by a factor of 1.2 and the same is through for the mean.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
When we look at this, we can bring the 1.2 outside these brackets and it becomes (1.2)².

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The reason why I squared this, we can bring it outside  Xi and u but there's a square over here

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we can move it outside this sum as a factor.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now this is true for the variance but not the standard deviation.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The standard deviation is cleared of the variance.

00:00:48.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The standard deviation was up by factor of 1.2 only, with a constant offset of zero.
