00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.330
Let's look at the solution to this part of

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.954
our BTB &amp; BHT quiz. The question now is, which

00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:08.528
of the four BTB entries do we use for each

00:00:08.528 --> 00:00:12.808
of these instructions? Leave the field blank if none is

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:15.365
used. We already know that we use the BTB

00:00:15.365 --> 00:00:18.332
once here and a hundred times here, and that's all

00:00:18.332 --> 00:00:21.973
of the BTB uses. So the only instructions that we

00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:26.120
really need to put something for is this and this.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.073
How do we determine which BTB entry do we use? Well, we look at the address and

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:39.813
just the same way that we did it for the BHT, in this case, the address is

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:43.820
C008. The BTB has four entries. We take

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.860
the lower most two bits, in this case, because

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.230
we need two bits to tell us which of

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.275
the four entries. But, we don't use the bits

00:00:51.275 --> 00:00:54.778
that are always the same for all instructions. In this case, the lower most

00:00:54.778 --> 00:01:01.158
two bits. So, really, this is the number of the BTB entry for the C008

00:01:01.158 --> 00:01:08.971
instruction. 10 is 2. So we will use the entry number 2. The other instruction

00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:15.911
that we need to figure out is at the address C01C. So it's going to

00:01:15.911 --> 00:01:21.351
be C01C. Again, ignore the lower most bits that

00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:24.519
stay the same. Take the next two bits because

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.928
we need to know which of the four entries

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:29.775
to use, and we get 11, which corresponds to

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:34.880
the entry number 3. As you can see, only entries number 2 and 3 are used in this

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.670
loop. If this instruction were a taken branch, it

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.004
would have used and entry number 0. This one would

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:43.236
have used 1, 2, 3, and then, because

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:45.716
we have 4 entries, this one, again, would be

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:47.907
using entry number 0, 1, 2, 3. But

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:50.326
because these are the only ones that actually use

00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:52.037
these entries, all we have to do is

00:01:52.037 --> 00:01:54.960
access the entry number 2 here. It's accessed once,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.890
if you remember. And access the entry number 3

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.530
here. It's accessed a hundred times, if you remember.
