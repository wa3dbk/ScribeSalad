00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.400
All non trivial design involves refinement. Moving from a high level

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.540
of understanding to an implementation. Multiple levels may be involved,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.570
not just two, depending on the complexity of the problem. To execute

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.680
a multilevel design properly, three properties must obtain. The top level must

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.860
faithfully represent the requirements. Each level must be internally consistent.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.020
And third, each lower level must faithfully represent the level above it.
