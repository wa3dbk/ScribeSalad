00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.657
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We can actually use slope intercept form to graph this line as well. We can

00:00:04.657 --> 00:00:09.489
graph this equation by starting with the y-intercept or the b. So, I look on my

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:14.579
y-axis, and I go to 20 units. 0,20 my y-intercept. You can start at this point

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:19.362
because we begin graphing with the letter b. Now that we have the point of the

00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:24.337
y-intercept, we can graph using our slope. Positive 2. I know slope is rise

00:00:24.337 --> 00:00:28.705
divided by run. So, I'm going to write my number 2 as 2 divided by 1. Both of

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:33.474
these numbers are positive, so I need to move in a positive direction. I'm going

00:00:33.474 --> 00:00:37.806
to go up two units and then right one unit. These are my directions for how I

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:42.414
should move from this point on the graph. I should move up two units, and then

00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:46.941
right one unit. Notice that my y-axis is in increments of 4. So, I only need to

00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:51.192
move up half that amount. Half that amount would be two units. Then, on my

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:55.493
x-axis, I move one direction to the right. So, I moved two units up, and then

00:00:55.493 --> 00:00:59.949
one unit to the right. That gets me to my next point on the graph. If I repeat

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.507
this process, I can continue getting other points on the graph. I go up two

00:01:04.507 --> 00:01:08.482
units, right one unit. Up two units, right one unit. I know it looks a little

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:13.086
funny on this graph, but it's because we've used a scale here. So the coordinate

00:01:13.086 --> 00:01:16.728
grid doesn't match these numbers. It looks a little different.
