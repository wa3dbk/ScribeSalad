00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
Okay, now that we have seen how to do registry naming and

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.760
how to follow the true dependencies and so on, we are ready to learn what

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.310
the instruction level parallelism or ILP is. So, we will now define what it is.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.100
So, the ILP really can be defined as the IPC instructions per cycle when

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.990
we have a processor that can do an entire instruction in one cycle.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.340
So it doesn't need a pipeline. It can fetch the decode, execute, write result,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.470
everything, in just a single cycle for one instruction.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.510
Also, the processor can do any number of instructions in the same cycle.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.200
So theoretically, it could just fetch and execute your entire program in the one

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.140
cycle. But it still has to obey true dependencies. So if

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.450
one instruction depends on another, then they cannot be done in the same cycle.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.560
You have to first do one and then the one that needs its result.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.060
So as you can see, ILP really is kind of what an ideal processor can do.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.230
Subject only to obey true dependencies. How do we compute the IL P for

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.610
a program? Well, we first rename all the registers. So we do register renaming

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.590
first. And then, we pretend we execute. So what we do is, we say okay,

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.870
in the first cycle, these are the instructions that don't depend on anything. So

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.280
they can go. In the next cycle, we go through the same thing and so on until we

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.260
run out of instructions to do. At which point we know how many cycles it is.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.580
Now the one thing that you should remember about the ILP and that will help you

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.980
realize what it is and how to do it is that ILP is a property of

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.080
a program not of any particular processor. So basically, we define the ILP to be

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.480
what would this program do as far as the IPC is concerned on an ideal processor.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.070
So it has nothing to do with what kind of processor you actually run it on.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.110
It has everything to do with just the dependencies in the program. So

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.590
be mindful of that, because for example it doesn't make really sense to say

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.397
something like what's the ILP on this program on the I don't know, Intel Core i7

00:02:01.397 --> 00:02:06.540
processor. Because the ILP on the Intel Core i7 processor is beside the point.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.258
Because the ILP is really the performance of this program on an ideal processor

00:02:10.258 --> 00:02:14.470
that has nothing to do with Intel i7. Okay, so just, just remember that,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.330
when you're asked to produce the ILP, you should just consider the program.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.930
It doesn't matter what the processor looks like, because the ILP is computed for

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.170
a perfect processor anyway. In contrast, you could

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.720
say that the IPC of this program on a given processor is something else, but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.990
be mindful of this. Basically the LP you only need to see the program,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.830
you don't really need to know what the processor looks like.
