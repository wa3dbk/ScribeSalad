00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.220
Customer wants to buy something,
company wants to sell something,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.660
what's sitting in between them?

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.580
A form.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.280
If you think about registration,
a company wants to grow their user base,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.660
someone wants to be part of that
community, or product or they have.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.650
And again what's between them is a form.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.850
So in all these places where
this connection happens

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.480
between the organizations that
make things on the internet, and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.220
the people that use those things,
there's generally a form.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.730
And those forms as you say
consist of input fields.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.210
The biggest mistake that i think people
make is treating those things from

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.500
what I would call almost
a back end perspective.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.560
That is inside of a database,
to simplify things, you have these name

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.800
value pairs, right, name and
then a field for what the name is.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.260
And you've got a whole
bunch of these things and

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.500
they constitute something like
the record of a user, or a purchase.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.710
And when it comes time to collect
that information to fully fill in

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.210
that database, what you do is you just
spit out those name value pairs as input

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.530
fields and labels.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.810
And ta-da, job done with a form.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.650
So both of these things I learned
almost the hard way, if you will,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.730
at eBay about how to think
about them differently.

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.960
When I was at Ebay many years ago it was
the 28th largest economy in the world.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.680
So lots and lots of people buying and
selling things on there.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.440
And we found that when we made small
changes to these forms we could really

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.870
have a huge impact.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.740
In fact when we redesigned
the registration form process,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.480
we had to go back to Wall Street and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.160
restate earnings because that was
how tremendous the impact was.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.230
And when you think about the ability for
something like a form to impact

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.980
something like the 28th largest economy
in the entire planet, you really start

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.410
to understand the importance of all
the little details in the forms.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.600
And that goes well beyond which
name value pairs you include.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.380
How you put the labels in,
what kind of form control you use,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.350
what kind of feedback you give to people
as they're filling in this information.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.240
How do you organize it?

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.515
What do you do to message the before and
after parts of the form?

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:01.650
because it's a part of a broader flow.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.442
And so the biggest mistake is really not
considering that full envelope of form

00:02:05.442 --> 00:02:10.169
design, and really just regurgitating
a database's fields onto a screen and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.560
putting a submit button on the bottom
