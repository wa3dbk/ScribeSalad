I want to highlight another thing. Let's look at this

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.660
data. It looks kind of, strange, right? This data's actually

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.820
in JSON format. The same JSON that we discussed

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.390
earlier in this class. As I insinuated earlier, we can

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.650
kind of, think of JSON data as a Python

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.110
dictionary. Let's make this data easier to read and I'll

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.410
show you what I mean. See how each piece

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.720
of data in this JSON object corresponds to a key,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.550
very much how like every value in a Python dictionary corresponds to a key. So

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.530
our first key here is album. And the value is actually another JSON object. Here

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.320
we have key name, value unapologetic, key

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.150
artist, value of Rihanna, and so on. Although

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.760
JSON is not equivalent to Python dictionaries,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.730
you can think of them as similar abstractions.
