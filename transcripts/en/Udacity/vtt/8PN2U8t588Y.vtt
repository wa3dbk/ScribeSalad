00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.395
Let's look at the solution to our
message passing versus shared memory

00:00:03.395 --> 00:00:06.840
quiz.If we have one core
initializing an array, and

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.680
then all others reading
the entire array.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.480
Data distribution, the number of
lines of code you need to do it

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.020
in message passing, is significant.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.830
The number of lines of code we need for

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.960
that in shared memory is
really zero lines of code

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.930
because once the array is initialized
in memory others can simply read it.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.910
They don't need to really
distribute the data in any way.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.990
In contrast, in message passing
the core that initializes the array

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.690
now needs to send it explicitly
to all the other cores and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.620
the other cores need to
receive it explicitly.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.560
So there is definitely more
lines of code in message passing

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.230
than in shared memory.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.710
Once you have the data distribution for

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.640
shared memory you don't
need do anything for it.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.160
For message passing you need to send and
receive.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.020
Synchronization that makes sure the
array is initialized before we get to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.650
read it, adds how many lines of code?

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.340
In message passing, it adds 0 lines
of code because the sends and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.380
receives that we needed to to do to
the receive the data already insure

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.580
that until we receive the array,
we cannot read it.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.240
So when we get to read it after the
receive, we know that it's been already

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.620
initialized, because the send
happens after the initialization.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.110
In shared memory, however,
while the initialization is happening,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.910
the other threads could
just begin reading it, so

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.320
we need to add some explicit
synchronization out to make sure that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.390
the reader's wait while
the initialization is happening.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.660
So we here have more
than 0 lines of code.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.610
In this case the message
passing code is simpler

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.050
as far as synchronization is concerned
than the shared memory code.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.020
This is typically going to be what
happens between shared memory and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.150
message passing.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.380
Message passing needs to
distribute data, but in doing so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.240
it also synchronizes.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.800
Shared memory doesn't need to distribute
data, but if synchronization is needed

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.240
after the distribution it needs
to add explicit code to do that.
