00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.650
One of the things we also should discuss is the terminology confusion about

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.029
the out of order processors and how we name different parts of them.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.330
We have been calling the stages of the execution, issue was when we obtained

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.440
the reservation station and the A.R.B. entry. Dispatch was when the instruction

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.870
was selected for execution, and commit was when the instruction has committed.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.440
This terminology was introduced in the original [UNKNOWN] algorithm and

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.290
then commit was introduced in the first paper that talked about [UNKNOWN]. So

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.910
most of the academics are going to use, this terminology, so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.760
most of the research papers that are written will use something similar to this.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.300
However, some companies and some of the papers, will for issue use the term,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.990
not only issue, but also, allocate because, this is when we allocated resources

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.001
for the instructions. And so pretty much we allocate and then [UNKNOWN] and so

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.280
on. So they're going to call this allocating, sort of issue.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.170
And, to confuse the issue even further, some call the issue part,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.319
dispatch. So we dispatch the instruction to reservation stations and

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.510
the ROB entries. Similarly, what we have been calling dispatch,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.180
some will call execute. Some will call it issue, so we issue the instruction

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.860
from a reservation station to execution, as well as our usual dispatch,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.600
which is we dispatch the instruction to execution. And finally, the commit is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.190
most often called commit, but sometimes, it's been called complete, which

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.945
introduces some confusion because actually the instruction completes execution.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:37.220
Well before it commits, it's just that now, the term complete will refer to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.580
commit if that is the nomenclature that they are using. And then, commit is

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.890
also often called retire. So we retire the instruction from the processor. And

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.170
because a lot of papers have been written by academics, especially graduate

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.070
students, commit has also been called graduate. You can guess why.
