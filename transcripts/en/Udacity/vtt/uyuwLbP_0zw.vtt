Okay. My answer looks something like this.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I had to import minidom so we could use that,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and then we used a parse string for minidom,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which is what we used previously in lecture to parse the XML that were passed in in this parameter.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then I used getElementsByTagName GML coordinates.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Sometimes if the XML is more complex, you can't just cheat

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and find the one tag name that you're looking for,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but in this case we know there's only going to be one coordinates element

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in a valid response, so we can just see if there's any element in here that has this tag name.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If we have that element, this should return True.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We're actually kind of going out on a limb here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If this wasn't such a simple document, such a simple protocol,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'd probably have to check to see are there childnodes?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Do those childnodes have values? That sort of thing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I haven't done any testing that would suggest that. Just assuming it's all there it doesn't work.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
What I do is if it's all there, we call a split, which splits on the comma to get the two parts--

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the longitude and the latitude--and then we reverse them and return with latitude and longitude.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If we print our response, this is what we get.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now if I were to change our XML a little bit--let's say we just get rid of the actual coordinate

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
from the sample XML I passed in--and run this, we get None as our answer.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That should work for now. Good job if you got that, and let's add this to our program.
