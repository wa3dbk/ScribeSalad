00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right, here is our algorithm before for mean.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We're going to change this to work for max--max as it turns out is the name of my son

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because I just find the stuff really important.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In the very deep sense, the thing for computing is functionally equivalent to the mean.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's really very, very similar kind of calculation that's happening,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but the details are going to end up being a little bit different.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We're going to start off instead of the total of zero sort of a bit the max-so-far being

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
whatever the first element of the list is, and then, so we should make sure that we don't

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
compute that one twice then we're going to consider all the other elements in the list, and if

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the element that we're currently considering beat the max-so-far, then we have a new max-so-far.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There can be only one and that's what we do, we just apply this task to every element to the list

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
keeping track of the max-so-far, and then, when we're done,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the max so far is the max-so-far of everything--woohoo!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, perhaps not surprisingly Python--you don't want to do this.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You don't want to write your own max routine because Python already has one,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but just as before, you have to be really careful when you use things like max in your programs

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to keep in mind that this is a linear time operation--it's not constant time.
