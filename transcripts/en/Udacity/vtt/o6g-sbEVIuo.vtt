00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.987
Let's keep moving forward with completing this square. What terms belong in

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:07.708
these 2 boxes to help us complete the square? Since the right side of the

00:00:07.708 --> 00:00:11.738
equation doesn't change from this step to this step, that means that the total

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:15.759
value of the left side shouldn't change either. Think about what that means

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.913
about the relationship between what belongs in this box and what belongs in this

00:00:19.913 --> 00:00:20.204
box.
