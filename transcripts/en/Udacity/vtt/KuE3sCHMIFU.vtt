00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.070
There are dozens of frame works besides Bootstrap available,

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.320
Foundation 4 by Zerb and

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.540
Yaml 4 by Derk Jesse, provide huge sets of features comparable to Bootstrap.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.344
You'll find everything from responsive grid systems and nice looking buttons, to

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:21.060
Javascript modules for interactive elements like drop down menus and carousels.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.950
If you need simplicity other frameworks like 960 Grid, Susy and Frameless

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.610
provide their own grid systems without the overhead of additional features.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.930
Bootstrap is currently one of the most popular frameworks and

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.460
actually that's why we're using it.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.870
It does, however, include some advanced functionality you might never need.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.010
The good news is that because it's so robust, after you've mastered Bootstrap

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.660
you'll be able to pick up other, simpler frameworks with very little effort.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.980

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.630
