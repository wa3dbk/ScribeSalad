00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.336
Our numerator is a difference of two perfect squares. So we can factor it as 2x

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:11.022
plus 5y times 2x minus 5y. This denominator isn't identical to one of our

00:00:11.022 --> 00:00:16.024
factors, but it is an opposite polynomial for this factor. We can see that the

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.720
2xs are opposite in sign and the 5ys are also opposite in sign. So these two

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.981
factors simplify to be negative 1 and were left with negative 1. Times 2x plus

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:32.921
5y. We can distribute our negative 1 to get our answer, negative 2x minus 5y.

00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:36.180
Fantastic work if you got that expression.
