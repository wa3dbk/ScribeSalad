00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, let's talk about a slightly different issue, which is, "What we should do

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about test coverage for concurrent software?"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now in general in this class, we haven't been dealing at all with testing of concurrent code 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and this mainly it is a difficult and specialized skill. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's talk briefly about what coverage of concurrent software would actually mean. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
First of all, hopefully it's clear that while applying sequential code

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
coverage metrics to concurrent software is a fine idea.      

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Probably, these aren't going to give us any confidence with the code lacks

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
concurrency here such as race condition and the deadlocks.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's talk about how we would figure out if we've done a good job testing concurrent software. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So let's take for example this function x fer, which transfer some amount of money  

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
between bank account one and bank account two. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This particular function is designed to be called from different threads. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So what I've done here is mark a1 and a2 in red and these variables are representing the different  

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
bank accounts and then red in order to indicate that these are shared between different calls to x fer. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And so the transfer function is going to be called from one thread so some thread is going to transfer

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
money between accounts and also several other threads are going to do the same thing. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So we have is multiple threads calling this transfer function and as long as the threads are moving 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
money between different accounts, probably everything is all right.  

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
On the other hand, since the transfer function does not synchronize--

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that is it hasn't taken any sort of a lock while it manipulates the accounts.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If these threads are operating on the same accounts concurrently, then it's going to be a problem.  

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're going to mess up the balances of the accounts that are involved.  

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And so I ask the question, "What sort of coverage what we be looking for

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
while testing this function in order to detect this kind of bug?"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And the answer is some sort of a coverage metric to make sure that threads T1 and T2  

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
both call this function at the same time while transferring a money between the same accounts. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the coverage would essentially be T1 gets part way into the function

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then let's say it stops running, the processor then starts to run T2

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
for which it operates on the accounts and then completes and then this interleaving of actions     

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
between the different threads would be what would constitute a unit of test coverage so that is to say   

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we want to make sure we tested the case where the transfer account is concurrently call.  

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So that's one kind of coverage that we might look for when testing concurrent software.
