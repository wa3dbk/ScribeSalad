00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.200
The Dimple code to draw the bar chart is only actually five lines of code.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.410
In D3 this would take around 30 lines, and introduces many

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.530
more sources of error if we have to code 30 lines of code, rather than five.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.570
This really goes a long way to show how proper abstractions can go

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900
a long way towards developer productivity.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.970
The first line here simply creates a new

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.950
chart object in the specified element with the specified data.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.580
The first argument is a D3 selection that represents the SVG element.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.660
Which we would like to append our Dimple chart to.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.690
And the second argument is a JavaScript object representing the data which we

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.580
would like to display.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.250
In this case, the SVG is, was returned from the d3.select call.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.310
Or what is rather returned from the D3 code

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.360
that initially appends the SVG object.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.630
And the data object passed to dimple.chart is simply the same JavaScript object,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.520
in this case, an array of JavaScript object literals,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.540
that gets passed to the draw function callback.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.060
&gt;From our data loading function.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.820
The data loading function is below our window here but its simply D3's.TSV

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.940
function which loads a tab separate value file in this case world cup.tsv.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.580
And once it gets loaded via AJAX, passes that data content,

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.120
to the draw callback, which we see here.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.400
So the flow, which sometimes takes some getting used to,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.090
is a call to d3.tsv pass in a data file.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.920
Once loaded, the data file gets passed to draw.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.180
Which we can see here in our callback function.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.350
And this data object is the same as the contents of our

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.960
World Cup file which then gets passed in to the dimple chart constructor.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.050
There are a few other ways to manipulate the chart object itself if you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.060
are interested.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.500
And I definitely recommend always reading the documentation of any

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.440
function you use.
