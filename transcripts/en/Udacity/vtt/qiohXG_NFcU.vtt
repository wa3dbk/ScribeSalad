First, the document parser creates a paragraph

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.980
node and adds the text fragment. Then it

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.560
encounters the script tag, at which point

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.180
it pauses DOM construction and waits for JavaScript

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.360
engine to execute the script. The script

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.850
appends with JavaScript and exits. At which point,

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.470
you resume DOM construction and append is

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.820
awesome text fragment. As a result, we get

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.280
awesome page with JavaScript is awesome.
