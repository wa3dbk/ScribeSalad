00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.570
Your device has a pretty nifty developer
option for showing GPU overdraw.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.810
Once you toggle back to active,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.580
you'll notice that your layouts
are all drawn with a tint.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.860
A pixel drawn once is
shown in its normal color.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.640
But when the pixel is drawn over itself,
it's tinted.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.200
You've got blue for one overdraw, green
for two, pink for three and red for

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.290
four or more.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.080
Clearly, the goal here is to
minimize the amount of red, and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.440
keep everything fairly blue.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.410
To see how this works,
we'll look at Sunshine both before and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.740
after Dan updated it with a look
inspired by Material Design.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.370
You'll notice that most things
are pretty consistent, except that

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.710
after material, everything is a shade or
two darker on the tint scale.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.460
This is because material design focuses
on beautiful components and transitions.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.110
And so
it comes with a heavier drawing cost.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.560
Some events have a heavier cost as well.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.540
Clicking, for example,

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.060
tends to result in a shading effect as
an indicator of the action to the user.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.410
You can see this with a red
overdraw on a touch event.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.690
With material design, though,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.270
we increase the number of these types of
smaller overdraws with the addition of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.860
animations, such as the scroll animation
or the hover action in the menu.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.070
These animation elements add
a bit of magic to the app and

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.030
help create a beautiful user experience,
but as you've seen,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.420
there's clearly a rendering cost.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.460
Perf considerations are a trade-off.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.470
You want to do fancy things, but
you might be doing too much, so

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.450
use your tools to set up
a regular testing process and

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.540
then evaluate why your changes for the
better versus how it could be improved.
