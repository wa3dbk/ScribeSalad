00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.750
Now, I don't want you to feel intimidated by all of these complexity classes

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.370
rather you should be proud of yourself and I would say congratulations to you

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.380
for having learned so much in this course about computational complexity

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.620
where you met Alice, Bob, and Carol and later, we also met Dave

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.000
We didn't know anything about their problems.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.830
We didn't know if there was a good algorithm for vertex cover or if we just couldn't find one.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.890
Similar for clique and independent set and shortest tour.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.509
Later, we also learned about SAT and then we started out with the concept of NP completeness,

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.050
which suggested that many of these problems here are hard.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.700
Then we went on to search trees to show how some of these problems

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.259
nevertheless can be solve efficiently, and we introduced the concept of pre-processing.

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:45.500
We showed that some problems are fixed using parameter tractable

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.540
using either the size of the solution or some parameter such as distance

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.370
from triviality as a parameter.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.650
We talked about constant factor approximation algorithms, the concept of a PTAS,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.730
problems for which there's likely no constant factor approximation algorithm

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.300
unless P=NP.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.909
We talked about Monte Carlo randomized algorithms.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.280
We talked about Las Vegas randomized algorithms.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.810
And we talked about which of these problems, although worst-case analysis

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.509
might suggest otherwise are usually very well solvable in practice.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.500
This is my final quiz for you in this unit.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.570
What I would like you to do is think about all the things you now know about these problems

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.210
what you know about vertex cover, what you know about clique and independent set,

00:01:28.210 --> 99:59:59.000
about shortest tour, and 3-SAT and then just make check marks here on what you know.
