00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.770
In object orientated analysis we saw that nouns could give us a good lead into

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.580
what the classes are going to be. Similarly verbs can be used for

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.160
several purposes one of which is to describe what the relationships are between

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.540
the classes. In UML there are three kinds of relationships.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.550
There are associations. For example, association between people and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.900
vehicles, people drive vehicles.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.580
There's generalization, that is a car is a kind of vehicle. And

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.800
there's dependencies. There might be a dependency between cars and

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.270
pollution laws. If a pollution law changes, cars might have to be adapted.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.370
For example, putting on some kind of pollution control device.
