00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.660
Okay, so to understand better
how the order book works and

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.080
how exchanges work, let's look
at a couple more example orders.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.207
For brevity I'm leaving
out the symbol IBM.

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:14.990
This is all about IBM, so
just keep that in mind.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, so a market order comes
in to buy 100 shares at market.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.893
So again, we see that there's 1,000
shares that people are willing to sell.

00:00:24.893 --> 00:00:29.134
And the exchange has to give
the best price to the client, and so

00:00:29.134 --> 00:00:32.348
we give the client 100
shares at this price.

00:00:32.348 --> 00:00:34.530
So what happens, the order comes in.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.319
100 shares go away.

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:38.640
And now the order book
has changed just so

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.811
that there's 900 shares available
here now instead of 1,000.

00:00:42.811 --> 00:00:47.312
And the execution price is $100.

00:00:47.312 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's consider now a limit order.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.624
Someone wants to buy again 100
shares at a limit of 100.02.

00:00:55.624 --> 00:00:59.212
So, again looking at the order book,
again,

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:03.380
we can satisfy that order and,
again, at $100.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.610
So we're saying that we want
to pay no more then $100.02.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.660
So again, we can execute at 100, and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.410
now this goes down to 800 shares
instead of 900 being available.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.830
And the execution price for
this transaction again, is $100.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.060
And note also that that's less
than that limit price of $100.02.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.260
Let's look now at one last order,

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.890
a market order,
where someone wants to sell 175 shares.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.210
So that comes in.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.770
And we have 100 shares available
at 99.95, so those get sold.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.330
And there's none left
there at that price.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.290
So a 100 shares get executed at 99.95.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.290
So to get this 75 more shares,
we need to go deeper into the book.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.160
So we'll take these 50, 0 left there.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.340
We still need 25 more shares
to meet this order for 175.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.050
So we go even deeper into the book and
take some of these.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.073
So after all these transactions,

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:14.293
the order book has been
changed quite substantially.

00:02:14.293 --> 00:02:18.595
And this client gets
a 100 shares at 99.95,

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:22.457
50 at 99.90, and 25 at 99.05.

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:27.450
So all together, there's some average
price at which this was executed for

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.720
that client.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.590
Note now that as time has gone on, the
executed prices have been decreasing.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.080
Clearly we're seeing
that's a consequence of

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.920
there's much more sell
pressure than buy pressure.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.440
So that's how the order book works and
how exchanges

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.109
use order books to facilitate
transactions between their clients.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.210
This is what an order book
looks like in real life.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.100
Here in the middle, we have prices.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.900
And on either side here,
we see the order sizes.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.150
We're seeing here, sell orders and
how large they are, and

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.990
on this other side, buy orders and
how large they are.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.910
And the prices that they're being
executed here are in the middle.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.290
And as you can see,
it's changing dynamically and

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.440
rapidly as trades are executed.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.750
Here we see a price chart showing
how the prices is going up and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.270
down as these trades are being executed.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.030
So that's a live order book.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.590
This is using the trading
platform called Think or Swim.
