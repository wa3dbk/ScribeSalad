00:00:00.265 --> 00:00:04.800
FHIR is currently in its second
edition as a draft standard for

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.820
trial use or DSTU under the HL7
standards development process.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.157
According to Grahame Grieve,

00:00:13.157 --> 00:00:19.130
FHIR will contain some 100 to 150
resources when it is fully specified.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.400
But, as of the summer of 2015,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.860
it is anticipated that around a dozen
of these will be in final form.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.890
You can explore all currently proposed
FHIR resources using the link provided,

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.000
