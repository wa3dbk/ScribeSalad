00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.407
So as always, we're going to start to
simplify this term by identifying the

00:00:04.407 --> 00:00:10.112
constant factors in it. So for those, we
have 4 and -3. And remember, we want to

00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:14.336
move those to the front of the term, so
that they are the first two factors that

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:21.718
we have written. So this term is equal to
4 times -3 times the variable factors that we

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:27.379
have left over, x, y and x. So right off
the bat we know how to deal with two of the

00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:34.832
factors here. We know that 4 times -3 is just
equal to -12. So we can replace 4 times -3

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:40.558
with -12 and then write the 3 remaining
factors. There's something interesting

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.859
here though. We have two variables that are
the same. We have x and x. I'm going to

00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:48.713
rewrite this one more time with the order
of the variables switched so that the x's

00:00:48.713 --> 00:00:52.815
are next to each other. That's just
generally a good rule of thumb in algebra

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.564
is to write things that you think are
related to one another next to each other.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.294
This x times x is interesting. This is the
first chance that we're going to get to

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:06.075
use exponents. We've seen them already a
few times in this course, but we haven't

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:10.695
gotten to write our own factors with
exponents in them. So, this may seem like

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:16.094
new material or it may be review for you,
but x times x can also be written with an

00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:25.726
exponent as x^2.
In the same way, x * x * x = x^3, and so

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:30.776
on, and so forth. Remember that in all of
these equations right here, I didn't need

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:35.202
to write any of these multiplication
signs. If we had just written the x's

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:38.912
directly next to one another, without any
symbol in between, multiplication would

00:01:38.912 --> 00:01:43.355
still have been implied. So instead we
could just have xx equals x^2.

00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:48.579
I just wrote this out to be abundantly
clear. The exponents show how many of the

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:53.985
same factor are multiplied together.
Incidentally if 2 x's mulitiplied together

00:01:53.997 --> 00:02:00.360
is equal to X^2 then when we have just 1x
is equal to x^1.

00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:05.008
This seems a little bit silly to write
though, writing X to the 1 is more

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.836
complicated than writing just x so, we
usually don't move from having x to

00:02:09.848 --> 00:02:14.319
writing x to the first instead. So using
this information about exponents, we can

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.775
replace this x times x with an x^2.
And with that information we can rewrite

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:28.463
this term as -12x^2y.
We're obeying all the conventions we know

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:32.819
about how to write terms because we have
the constant factor at the front, and then

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.888
we have our variables in ascending
alphabetical order. We have the x^2 before

00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:41.313
the y. That was awesome, I know that this
was a pretty complicated thing that

00:02:41.325 --> 00:02:44.934
involved a ton of different concepts, some
of which we haven't focused on a lot yet.

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:48.599
But don't worry if exponents still don't
feel totally comfortable, we're going to

00:02:48.611 --> 00:02:50.596
keep working with them a ton more.
