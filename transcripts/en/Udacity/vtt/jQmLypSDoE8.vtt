00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.140
Okay, so now you might be thinking--well, okay, so programs can become so complicated

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.620
that no algorithm can decide whether they run infinitely or not.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.930
So is there a short program for which I could show you undecidability.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.610
Oh yes, there is such as a program--it's not very practical but it is an example

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.070
for undecidability for very simple program.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.370
Here's a simple example of a problem that is actually

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.570
not decidable, although it's very simple to write.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.810
So the input to that problem is an integer and we will just call that integer i

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:36.740
and the output is the number of iterations that it takes to get to i=1 using the following two rules--

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:47.750
If i is even, then set i to i/2 so they divide by 2. If i is odd, set i to 3i+1, just two simple rules.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.080
And so for example when you start out with i being 10, then we first apply the first rule.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.180
We get down to 5, 5 is odd so the new value is 16 and then we divide by 2, we divide by 2,

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.480
we divide by 2, we divide by 2, so we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 iterations.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.480
So i=10, then the answer is 6.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.840
So now we're going to let you play a little bit with this algorithm

00:01:12.840 --> 99:59:59.000
and then discuss the undecidability for it.
