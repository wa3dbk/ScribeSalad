00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.152
Now, to indicate that we want the positive and the negative versions of a

00:00:04.152 --> 00:00:08.780
number, we can write this symbol out in front, plus or minus. Now, in MathQuill,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.274
to create this symbol, you need to write backslash pm and then a space. The next

00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:17.396
step, like we said, is going to be to take the square root of both sides.

00:00:17.397 --> 00:00:21.245
Including both the positive and the negative routes. I've already dealt with the

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.995
left side for you and I'd like you to fill in the right side.
