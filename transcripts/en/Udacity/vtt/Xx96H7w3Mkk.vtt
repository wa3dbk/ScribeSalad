00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.925
I need to replace x with x minus 5 and y with y plus 2. Remember, that the

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:09.954
vertex of y equals 3x squared is at 0,0. So, if we want to move the graph down

00:00:09.954 --> 00:00:15.240
to and to the right 5, then the new vertex will be at 5, negative 2. Let's take

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.703
a look at that new graph. Here, I've plugged in those transformations you talked

00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:25.083
about in the last quiz, replacing y with y plus 2 and x with x minus 5 to make

00:00:25.083 --> 00:00:29.562
the vertex be at 5, negative 2, like we just figured out. So remember, the 3

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:34.319
here, this coefficient in front of the leading term, squish the parabola down to

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.953
be skinnier than the parent function. And then, the addition of these constant

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:40.690
terms shifted the graph over.
