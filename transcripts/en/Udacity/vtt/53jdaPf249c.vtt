00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's imagine we run a retailer with thousands of stores around

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.730
the world. And we have a big ledger that contains all

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.000
of our sales, the big book of sales for the year

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.110
2012. We've been asked to calculate things like the total sales per

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.500
store for the year. Let's say the lines of the ledger

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.460
look like this. The date of the purchase, the location of the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.990
store, what they bought, and the amount. One way we could

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.670
do this is just start at the beginning of the ledger and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.100
for every entry we see, write down the store

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.720
location and the amount. Then keep going. For the fourth

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.830
entry, we see that we've already written down Miami. So

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.119
we'll update the amount to 62.15, and we would continue.
