00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Yes, indeed, we could have the 24 down here,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but it can't be any deeper than the third level by the same argument

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that puts the smallest at the top.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you're the third smallest and you're, say, six or seven levels down,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
what are those numbers that lie above you in the tree.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They have to be smaller than you, so you can't have been at least not the unique third smallest.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, the answer I was looking for is 3.
