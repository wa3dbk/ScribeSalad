00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.200
So one of the things you'll do when
bringing people on to your project,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.120
is have consultations.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.300
You might have a designer or an engineer
come in to help you understand

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.750
what would be part of your
minimum buyable product, and

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.620
what might need to go in
a version two or version three.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.280
To do that,
we've brought in James and Karl.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.310
Now guys, we have this app here, this
is a prototype built out in envision.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.930
And the idea is that it is
an essentially a to do list or

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.720
calendar app.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.420
And I want to understand sort of
what we would go about making first,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.990
if we wanted to make
a version zero of this.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.080
So as you can see,
we've got these sort of welcome screens,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.930
these sort of home screens.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.894
And as we go on we've got a bunch of
extra features that I thought were

00:00:40.894 --> 00:00:42.201
really cool that we added on.

00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:45.540
We've got, you can view your tasks
by the month or by the week,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.564
you can see an overview of
what tasks you've completed,

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:51.540
what proportion of tasks
you've completed over time.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.130
You can also see tasks grouped
up in certain ways, so

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.860
you know all the tasks about cars or
all the recipes you've wanted to make.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.620
And then you've also got
sort of a profile and

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.960
a timeline of things we've done.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.420
And then sort of general
settings screens and a menu.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.695
Does that make sense?

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:08.473
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:08.473 --> 00:01:09.482
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:13.490
&gt;&gt; So, I'm really excited
about getting this built.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.450
First off, James, as a designer, what
are the things that you would like to

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.900
focus on in making this
a better app right now?

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.390
&gt;&gt; Color.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.880
I would probably change this
color palette and then,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.640
I really like this overview screen,
like this graphic is really cool.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.970
But I'd probably pull some
colors from the images,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.340
like maybe from your title bar and
use the Palette Library for

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.590
Android to make it kind
of more interesting.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.954
And I really like this group setting.

00:01:45.954 --> 00:01:49.942
And that's another place where
I might change up the colors,

00:01:49.942 --> 00:01:54.315
I might use more interesting
topography to make it more impactful of

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:58.764
how many items I have in this
automotive area, or books or whatever,

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:03.420
because that's not that readable
&gt;&gt; That makes sense.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.020
And Carl, how does that sound to you?

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.570
Do you think that that would be
a reasonable set of things to start

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.860
working on as every one?

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.330
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a lot here
in this envision prototype.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.870
I think that we should probably talk
about some of the core elements

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.410
before progressing into building
absolutely every screen.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.229
We probably want to talk about just the
most interesting interaction elements.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.840
So for instance,
I have to question whether or

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.760
not we really need high
fidelity graphs at this point.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.150
We're talking about
building a to-do app.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.840
So, let's focus on the core
elements of managing to dos.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.190
So if I'm understanding you correctly,
we want to at least have as our first

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.920
bit, building out, making a to-do,
checking off a to-do, things like that.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.437
&gt;&gt; And
do you think that it's worthwhile for

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.474
us to build out those small features?

00:02:53.474 --> 00:02:57.760
This stuff is really cool and we wanted
to include that in the app in the end.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.920
&gt;&gt; Ultimately, we can make
the app as big and featureful and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.690
fancy as you want.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.110
The thing that we have to do though
is express the core elements first,

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.720
the core functionality.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.570
What are users actually
doing with this app?

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.540
And in this case they're
managing their to dos,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540
they're managing a little
bit of their life.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.820
So we have to make that easy.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.470
We have to bring that to the forefront.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.130
There's a lot of extraneous views
here that maybe don't support that

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.430
core work flow.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.570
And so let's, I think it would best for

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.250
us to focus on the core
elements going forward.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.940
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.480
Now James, with what Carl just said,
that we want to focus on the core

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.756
elements, what would
we be able to work on?

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:39.955
What would we be able
to use your time on,

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.630
to make these core elements
a little bit better?

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.870
Right now, that core element if I'm
understanding it right, we would want

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.640
to have this screen where we have these
to-dos and be able to check them off.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.140
We would want, sort of our screen
of actually making a to-do.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.880
And then we'd want something
like I don't know, a calendar or

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.670
something, to help manage their life.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.550
&gt;&gt; Okay, so if we're focusing
on those three screens,

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.470
starting with this general
overview to do screen,

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.890
I would focus on the transitions between
that screen and the creating a to do,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.430
just to make it more instructive and
make more intuitive for the user.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.370
For this calendar,
probably a similar type thing, and

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.140
just focus more in making it glanceable
and more easy to read for, this

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.870
is the to do I have, this is what I need
to do at this moment, or for this day.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.280
&gt;&gt; So even if we're just
building a small feature set,

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.668
there's still stuff for
you as a designer to work.

00:04:35.668 --> 00:04:36.632
&gt;&gt; Oh definitely.

00:04:36.632 --> 00:04:40.023
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, you know, we've been
talking about this small feature set,

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:42.319
and I'm not sure if this
is actually a set that we,

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.250
I have the ability to pay you guys for
yet.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.420
I have a relatively small budget for
this and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.520
I want to make sure that we can
get this done within that budget.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.520
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we should adopt
a philosophy of launch and iterate here.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.310
That'll give us the agility to
move where our users are going

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.340
with our software, and allow us to
really focus on min viability first.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.300
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I think we probably have
enough to pay you guys to make this

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.450
initial minimum viable product
really good, really beautiful,

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.880
and actually functional.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.790
And then from there we can use the rest
of my budget as the users dictate.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.750
&gt;&gt; I think that's a great idea.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.780
&gt;&gt; Perfect, so that's how
a consultation session might go.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.560
You'll have some concerns from either
side and you'll have to balance them.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.600
&gt;&gt; And at the end you'll hopefully have
a sense of what is the minimum viable

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.470
product you'll be building.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.810
As you go through this, you'll have
multiple consultation sessions

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.180
at each release of the app,
and it might be valuable for

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.150
you to bring these concerns
in every step of the process.
