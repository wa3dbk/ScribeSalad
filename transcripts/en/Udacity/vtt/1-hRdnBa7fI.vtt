00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.232
The interval we need here goes from 
negative 2 to 2 and includes both of

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:06.802
these inputs. 
If we plug in any number outside of this

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:09.884
interval into our function, the number 
that we'll get under the square root sign

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:13.348
will be negative. 
We're looking for real numbers here, not

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:16.129
imaginary ones, so that's not going to 
work for us.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.620
None of those kinds of inputs will be 
allowed.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.849
You can see we have a pretty restricted 
domain here.
