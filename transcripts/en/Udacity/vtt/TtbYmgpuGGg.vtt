00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
We would have 52 and 817 1000ths inches squared. This is our correct answer.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.228
Fantastic thinking if you got there. Now, I know we haven't seen a problem like

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:14.449
this one yet, or that involves the square of a quantity, so don't worry if you

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.455
struggled. Let's see how we can do it. Because the area varies directly, we want

00:00:18.455 --> 00:00:21.984
to make sure that we list the first quantities that cross from one another. And

00:00:21.984 --> 00:00:26.404
notice too that the area doesn't just vary directly with the radius, it varies

00:00:26.404 --> 00:00:31.854
directly with the square of the radius. So we have to square the first radius.

00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:35.695
And then, for our second area, it will also vary directly with the square of its

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:39.434
radius. Now that we have our proportion set up, let's fill in each of the

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:43.499
numbers in the appropriate place. This would be our first area and this would be

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:50.344
the radius that goes with it. So we want to put 28 and 278 1000ths here, and 3

00:00:50.344 --> 00:00:55.490
here. Next we have the second radius which we know is 4 and 1 10th. So that will

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.590
go here, and then we'll use x for the area of 2. That's the area we're looking

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.874
for in our question. First I'm going to square each of these numbers to get this

00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:09.016
fraction. Next we cross multiply to get this equation. And finally we divide

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:12.143
both sides by 9 to get our final answer.
