00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.880
You know that the FirebaseArray
class uses ChildEventListeners.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.930
And it does that by implementing the
ChildEventListener callback interface.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.490
The point of the FirebaseArray class
is to keep a collection of items

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.270
that are in the Firebase database,
in sync with a bunch of matching

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.000
database snapshot objects that
are in the fire base array class.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.050
Specifically the snapshots are stored in
an instance variable called m snapshots.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.830
So Firebase array uses these child event
listeners to see when things are added,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.900
removed, changed, or
moved in the Firebase database and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.369
then make the changes in its
own internal array list.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.700
And then it triggers the Firebase
list adapter which makes all

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:35.470
the visual changes.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.425
I was actually messing around with the
Firebase array code a bit earlier and

00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:41.750
created a little mini project.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.810
And you can use this mini project to get
practice using some of the child even

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.070
listener code.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.455
This is all optional, but if you'd like
to get some practice writing code with

00:00:49.455 --> 00:00:52.739
some ChildEventListeners, I'd suggest
taking a deep dive into the code of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.880
the Firebase Array and
Firebase listed after classes.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.400
It'll also make it a bit more clear
about how the internals of these

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.570
classes work.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.590
I'll send over my code now and
you can take a look.
