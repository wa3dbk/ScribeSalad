00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.600
As you probably guessed, these are not fireworks for the 4th of

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.670
July but, rather, the explosion of the Ariane 5, which happened 30 seconds

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.250
or so after takeoff due to a software error. And this is

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.020
just an example of what can go wrong when we don't build software

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.600
and we don't test and verify and perform quality assurance of software

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.540
in the right way, and quite an expensive one. In fact, to develop

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.250
and to build the Ariane 5 it took 10 years. The cost

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.240
was around $7 billion and there were $500 million of cargo on board.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.280
Luckily, at least there were no humans on the

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.400
rocket. And you can find more details in case

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.610
you're interested about the Ariane 5 accident in the

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.230
lesson notes. I put a couple of links there.
