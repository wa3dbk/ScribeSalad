00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.400
In order for f of x equals a to the x, to exhibit exponential decay. A must lie

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.925
between 0 and 1, not including either of these numbers. When a is in this

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.955
interval, the value of the function is multiplied by a fraction each time x

00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:21.881
increases. Making f of x get smaller and smaller. Let's experiment with this

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:25.587
for a second. Here we are, back in friendly old Desmos, and I've typed in the

00:00:25.587 --> 00:00:30.836
general function that we've been talking about, f of x equals a to the x. I've

00:00:30.836 --> 00:00:37.130
made a into a number that I can adjust by sliding this right here. Right now, a

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.718
is set to 1 and, as we calculated before, this is just a horizontal line, f of

00:00:41.718 --> 00:00:47.610
x equals 1. Now, let's see what happens as I decrease a. You can see right

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.315
away, just when I let it go below 1, we already have a function showing

00:00:51.315 --> 00:00:56.894
exponential decay. As I continue to make it smaller, the decay gets more and

00:00:56.894 --> 00:01:00.930
more steep. It's happening more quickly. That's going to continue to happen

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.590
until a gets too small. When a reaches 0, we have that constant function again.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.504
Except, this time, it's at f of x equals 0. We can, of course, also slide over

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:14.415
into the exponential growth area as well. That would just mean we need to

00:01:14.415 --> 00:01:20.010
increase a past 1. Let's try that. Here were are back in our exponential decay.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.096
And there we go, we're growing. Just above 1 we already see that new pattern

00:01:26.096 --> 00:01:31.380
forming. And the growth gets steeper and steeper as a increases. Since we're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.375
going to be multiplying by more and more each time x increases. If I let a get

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:41.634
really big, our graph's going to increase at incredibly quick rate. I would

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.548
encourage you to visit the Desmos website and play around with this on your

00:01:44.548 --> 00:01:47.858
own. It's really fun to see how many different things you can do with

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.459
exponential functions.
