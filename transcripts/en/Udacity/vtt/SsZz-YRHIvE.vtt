00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, Kolmogorov Complexity gives us an interesting way to think about randomness.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's certainly a useful notion

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in many areas of computer science.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But, it's not going to give us a practical way

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to tell if the sequence is random.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It won't even give us a theoretical way to do that because it's uncomputable.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The next thing we might think about trying is statistical tests.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And, this in fact often used as part of an argument

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that something produces random numbers.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It should be part of that argument, but it can never be the whole argument.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The only thing we can do with a statistical test

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is show that something is non-random.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We can't ever prove that it is random.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We can always find some non-random sequence

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that satisfies all of our statistical tests.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, we're left with our best argument

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is how the sequence is actually generated.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
If we know how the sequence is produced,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we can have some confidence that it satisfies

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the randomness requirements we have,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at least for generating a good key.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And, the real requirement there is unpredictability.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We want to know if our sequence is a sequence of numbers like this;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
where each xi is under the reign of 0 to 2 to n-1

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That even an attacker who's seen the first m numbers in the sequence

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
can only guess the next one with the same probability they would have

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
if they were just guessing by chance,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
only 1 out of 2, 2 to the n, the size of the elements in the sequence.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, that's the property we want.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If we're going to get that property--and we can't do it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
by using Kolmogorov complexity because that's uncomputable

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and we can't do it with statistical tests because they can only show non-randomness--

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the way we're going to try to achieve that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
is by generating the sequence in a way that produces values

00:01:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that are unpredictable to the attacker.
