Welcome to lesson two. In this lesson, we'll learn

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.500
about the advantages of using R to perform data analyses.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.280
We'll install RStudio. And we'll learn the basic data

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.360
types and commands of R. Before we get started, I

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.990
want to share with you how one data scientist used R

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.710
to improve the health outcomes for the citizens of Chicago,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.520
Illinois. Data scientist Corey Nissen used the R programming language

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.665
to analyze tweets from people in the city of Chicago.

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:29.790
Corey analyzed tweets in real time by searching for the words food poisoning

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.689
in each of them. I want you to read more about his analysis and

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.170
his work by clicking on the link in the instructor notes. Try to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.540
find the answers to these next three questions as you read through the article.
