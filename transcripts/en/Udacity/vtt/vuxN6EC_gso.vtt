00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.620
One last note here is that we need to load in the dimple.js library in

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.420
addition to D3.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.380
Let's go to our text editor and

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.130
look at our template file that we'll be working with.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.620
As you can see here,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.920
it's a pretty standard HTML file as you've seen in lesson one.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.850
And as you can see at the top here, we first load in d3.js from D3's site.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.720
And the second script that we're loading in is dimple.js from dimple's site.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.090
Now it may not seem like a big deal but it's important that you put the script

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.270
to load the dimple library right below the script to load D3's library.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.270
Since D3 should be loaded before dimple.js gets loaded.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.140
As you can see here, in the head of our web page,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.870
we have the familiar draw function which will get called with D3 loads in data.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.060
And what we have here is a bunch of code to create a chart in Dimple.js.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.630
I don't want to go through this just yet, but

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.550
I want to show you the structure of the file we're working with.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.900
And just at the bottom here we have the familiar script tags in

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.290
the body which makes a standard call to D3 to load in

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.950
our tab separated values file world cup.tsv.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.670
And once our data gets loaded we'll pass the data to our draw function which we

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.380
defined above.
