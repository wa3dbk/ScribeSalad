00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.310
Now in configuration design, we not only know all the components like legs, and

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.939
set, and arms, and so on. We not only know the variables for

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.500
each of the components, like size and material, and cost.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.270
But we also know the ranges of values that any of these variables can take.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.200
Thus the seat of a chair may have a certain weight, or length, or

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.220
depth. Here between the sides and the seat in a very simple matter in terms of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
the mass of the seat as measured in grams. So 10 to 100 grams, you'll see in

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.260
minute why we're using this simple measure. So when it is brackets for

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.340
this material slot suggests that there is a range here, it will show the range

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.720
on the left [UNKNOWN]. TThe cost then will be determined by the size and

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.370
the materials. Let us suppose that this table captures the cost per gram for

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.370
certain kinds of materials. Now you can see why we're using gram as a measure

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.430
for the size of the seat. We wanted to very easily relate the size to the cost.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.750
The material slot now can take one of these three values. This is the range of

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.980
values that can go into the material slot. Given a particular size and

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.440
a particular material, we can calculate this cost. Note that this representation

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.700
allows us to calculate the total mass of the chair and the total cost of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.900
the chair, given the total mass and the total cost at least of the components.
