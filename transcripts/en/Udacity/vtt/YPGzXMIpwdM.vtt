00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
In this unit, we will be working with Monte Carlo approaches because we're looking at

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.720
NP complete problems and actually as you will see there is not that many algorithms using randomness

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.990
for NP complete problems anyway and one I'm going to show you

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.220
in more detail is a Monte Carlo algorithm.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.340
Now the important thing about a Monte Carlo algorithm is this here, the probability.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.550
Now of course it would be great if the probability with which we get the best possible solution

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.260
would be some constant because then we would have a very good algorithm

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.020
as the next quiz will show you.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.720
So say we have a Monte Carlo algorithm with probability 1/2, how often do we need to run it

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.470
until we are 99.9% certain that we have the best possible answer

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.820
and please enter your answer here in this box.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.400
Now if you don't feel comfortable with probabilities, of course, you can also skip ahead,

00:00:45.400 --> 99:59:59.000
but even if you just have a basic knowledge of probabilities, you can probably get this one.
