00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.174
So we have this new right triangle

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:05.177
but what is this vertical distance here?

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:07.824
When you think you know it, type it in here

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.924
and I have already included the units of centimeters.

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:15.803
You will also want to round your answer
to the nearest tenth.

00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:20.206
So you should have one digit after the decimal point.
