00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.698
Here, I've taken the two solutions to the equation we solved before and I'd like

00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:09.327
you to multiply them together. So what is 3 plus 4i times 3 minus 4i? I'd like

00:00:09.327 --> 00:00:13.791
you to work all these out by hand but before you do, think about what pattern

00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:18.327
you see here or how these two factors relate to one another and try to predict

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:20.867
what kind of answer you'll get over here.
