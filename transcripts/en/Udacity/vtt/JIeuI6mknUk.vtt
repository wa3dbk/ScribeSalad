00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.450
So welcome to Unit Five. The main topic for this

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.890
unit is trying to understand the cost of running programs. So

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.260
far, we haven't really worried about this. We've been very happy

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.590
to write code. If we get the correct result, that's a

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.640
great thing. But once we start making programs bigger, worrying

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.750
about programs that do more things, running on larger inputs, we

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.380
have to start thinking about the cost of running our programs.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.290
And this question of what it costs to evaluate an execution

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.570
is a very important problem in computer science. In some

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.490
sense, it's one of the most fundamental problems. Many people

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.930
spend their whole careers working on this. And it's a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.060
problem called Algorithm Analysis. I haven't yet explained what an

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.220
algorithm is. But you've actually written many of them already.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.370
So an algorithm is a procedure that always finishes. A

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.920
procedure is just a well-define sequence of steps. It has

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.410
to be defined precisely enough that it could be executed mechanically.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.080
So to be a procedure, it has to be something

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.550
that can be executed without any thought. And we're mostly interested

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.140
in procedures that can be executed by computers. But the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.300
important part of what makes it a procedure is that the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.320
steps are very precisely defined and don't require any thought

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.950
to execute. To be an algorithm, it has to always finish,

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.170
and we've pointed out already that this is a very tough

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.900
problem to figure out whether a program will finish. In general,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.470
it's not possible to answer that question, but for many specific

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.720
programs it is, and in order for a program to be an

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.610
algorithm, we have to know that it always finishes, and it always

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.150
produces a correct result. So once we have an algorithm, well, we

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.870
know we have a well-defined sequence of steps, so we can reason

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.660
about what will happen on any input, and we know that we

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.720
will always finish and always produce the correct result. So then we

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.920
can think about what the cost is of executing that algorithm on

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.810
some input. So how should we think about cost?

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.280
And the way computer scientists think about cost is

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.860
quite different from how most people think about cost.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.080
So if you're normally thinking about cost, well, if

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.340
you've got a specific object, let's say, you've got

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.447
a cool car. This is supposed to be a

00:02:02.447 --> 00:02:05.246
cool car. It doesn't quite look like a cool

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.365
car, and it's got a cost associated with it.

00:02:08.365 --> 00:02:11.470
Let's say, that's a $25,000 car, and you have some

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.040
other car. So you have one car, it's got a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.880
particular cost, that's what it costs you get that car.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.365
You could another car that would be smaller and green, and

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:24.480
let's say that car costs $10,000. And when we think

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.340
about the cost of things normally, we have very specific things,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.290
and they have specific costs. And we know that the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.550
red car costs $25,000; the green car costs $10,000; the red

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.420
car costs more than the green car. We

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.190
just need to compare those costs. So when we

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.790
think about the cost of algorithms, we don't

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.680
have a specific execution in mind usually. What we

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.730
want to understand is how the cost depends on

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.830
input. So we might have two different algorithms. Let's

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.060
say this is algorithm one, and we have a

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.670
second algorithm that solves the same problem. And both

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.410
of these are algorithms that take inputs and produce output.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.660
And if we want to decide which algorithm is better, well, we

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.980
don't have a specific cost for the algorithm the way we

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.760
do for the cars. And we can say the red car

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.230
costs more than the green car. The cost depends on the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.820
actual input that we run the algorithm on, so it might

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.640
be the case for some inputs algorithm one is faster, and

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.350
for other inputs, algorithm two is faster, and I should label

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.920
this algorithm two. So what we need to understand is how

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.380
the cost of executing the algorithm depends on the input. We

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.450
don't want to do that for every specific input, right, if we

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.450
had to do that for every input, well, we might as

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.930
well just run it on the input and see what it costs.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.510
What we want to do is be able to predict this without

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.430
actually having to run on on every input. Normally, there isn't that

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.120
much that matters about this specific input. The main thing that's going to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.940
matter about the input is the size of the input. That's not

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.434
always the case, and we'll see examples where other properties

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.760
of the input matter, but the primary way that we talk

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.340
about cost in computer Science is based on the size

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.660
of the input. As the size of inc, input increases, how

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.420
does the cost to evaluate the procedure increase? So cost

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.920
ultimately always comes down to money. And when it comes down

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.410
to money, well, what are the things that cost money when

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.110
we execute algorithms? And the main things that costs money are

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:24.090
the time it takes to finish. If we get an answer

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.370
more quickly, well, we've spent less time on it, and we

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.570
can also rent computers by the time to execute. There are

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.980
lots of cloud computing services now that will give you a processor

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.360
of a certain power for a certain amount of time, for

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.600
a certain number of cents per hour. So time really is money.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.060
So we don't need to turn our cost estimates into money

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.570
because we don't necessarily know how much our computing cost will be.

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.970
But if we can understand the time it takes to execute, that

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.380
will give us a good sense of the cost. The other main

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.000
cost is often memory. So, if we know that we need a

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.630
certain amount of memory to be able to execute our algorithms, well,

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.140
that tells us something about the size of computer we need and

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.320
how expensive that's going to be. So, we don't usually talk about cost

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.570
in terms of dollars when we analyze a logarithms, we're talking about

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.880
cost in terms of time and memory. But those things in real

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.160
implementations end up being cost in terms of

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.080
dollars. So we're mostly going to focus on measuring time,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.630
and time is usually the most important cost

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.210
of running an algorithm. Memory is often another consideration.
