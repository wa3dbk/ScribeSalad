00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
Even though some of us might think
we need a traffic psychologist

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.740
when we're stuck in traffic for hours
and going crazy, it's not a real subfield.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.270
Neither is canine psychology,
although there are psychologists

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.749
who primarily use animals
in their research.

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.110
And behavioral psychology has been used
to teach animals how to do amazing things.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.243
For example, did you know that rats
can detect landmines through smell?

00:00:22.243 --> 00:00:25.996
Or that dolphins can locate
underwater mines and protect boats?

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:28.960
Psychologists can learn a lot
from animals through research.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.911
And psychological methods
can be used to teach animals

00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:33.924
how to help and work with humans.
