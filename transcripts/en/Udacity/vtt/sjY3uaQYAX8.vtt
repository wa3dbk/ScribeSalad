00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.320
We're going to go a little, into a little bit more depth with respect to

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.300
the singleton pattern and provide you an example of it.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.370
Singleton's provide you a way to ensure that a class has only one instance and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.940
to provide a global point of reference to that particular instance.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.770
As far as motivation is concerned, consider the top level of your architecture

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.370
where there may appear components that should only have one instance.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.140
For example, a database or a log-in manager.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
How do you guarantee that only one such instance exists?
