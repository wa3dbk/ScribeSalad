00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
And there's actually only a single decidable property here.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.020
All of the other properties are undecidable.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.180
Now let's go quickly through them, one by one, to discuss why that is.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.380
So always returns 1; you know that is undecidable by

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.260
Rice's Theorem.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.870
It's a similar case here; we already have that.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.990
Adding 2 numbers, Rice's Theorem.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.130
Doesn't do anything, Rice's Theorem.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.150
No matter how you define doesn't do anything;

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.750
it will always come back to Rice's Theorem.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.060
Converts an MP3 file, Rice's Theorem.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.720
Reads a file; that is an interesting one,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.050
because you could argue that this does not fall under Rice's Theorem,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.440
but even if you have that argument,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.050
it's still not decidable, because what I could do, for example

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.230
so I can modify any program so it will only read a file

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.080
once it's done

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.620
and that again will allow me to solve the halting problem.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.760
Is the program a virus; Rice's Theorem.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.030
Writes to a file.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.320
similar logic as reads to a file.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.830
Modifies itself; that is an interesting one,

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.800
because of course here you could say

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.190
Well, of course I could just go through the code

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.550
and whenever the program accesses itself,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.190
I know it has that property,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.200
but the thing is this:

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.980
the program could have certain lines that suggest this program modifies itself,

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.690
but deciding whether those lines will actually be reached

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.540
once the program executes,

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.070
that again would allow you to solve the halting problem,

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.540
so also this isn't decidable.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.170
The same one here; of course you can look at a certain program

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.920
and say, Doesn't the program return integers?

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.620
but you had a program that can decide

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.060
if a program only returns integers,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.550
that again would allow you to solve the halting problem,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.560
And the same thing for downloading data.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.280
If I had a program that designs generally

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.400
for any other program if it downloads data,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.510
I could use the same technique as for reading a file.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.160
I could basically modify any program

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.130
so that it could run completely on its own data

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.320
that it already has included

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.240
and downloads data basically to signify that it's done.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.390
If I could decide this in the general case,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.280
then I would have also solved the halting problem.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.350
Now the question of course is,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.340
If this here has any practical relevance;

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.750
for example, reading a file,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.480
because for most programs, of course,

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.050
you will be able to decide

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.350
if they ever read a file or not.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.690
Then again, on the other hand, if you look at general software testing,

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.390
this is an interesting question from a perspective of code coverage, for example.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.320
If you could decide if a program reads a file,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.610
and of course you want the program to read a file,

00:02:18.610 --> 99:59:59.000
then that would tell you something about the correctness of that program.
