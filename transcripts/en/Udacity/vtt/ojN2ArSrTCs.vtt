00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's see a slightly more lively example.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a lot going on in this example, and some of it you may not have seen before.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I'm making a procedure called makegreeter that--and this is cute--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
inside of it defines another procedure.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If you haven't seen this before in Python, don't worry,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but it is possible to make 1 function inside another.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Here I'm making a function called greeter

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that takes a person to be talking to and prints out a particular greeting to that person.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And then this makegreeter function returns greeter this function that I just defined in here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Wow! This is not obvious.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So down here I'm making a variable sayhello,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which is the result of making a greeter who always starts with "hello from uttar pradesh".

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And then I can ask that greeter to say hello to Gracie

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and also say hello to Lucknow.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So sayhello points to or references a particular version of greeter

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
where the greeting has been locked in to be hello from the UP.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If you haven't been there, Uttar Pradesh is a region in India.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Its capital city is Lucknow, known as The City of Nawabs.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It's known for its manufacturing and retailing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and possibly also silversmithing. Cool place. Very populous.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So here I've recopied the same code from before.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Nothing has changed except that I'm abbreviating Uttar Pradesh with u.p.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And now over here on the right I'm drawing out the chained or nested environment frames

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as we're calling sayhello("gracie").

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I'd like you to help me out with just the last part.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Down here in this final environment frame there's a single variable bound to a value.

00:01:41.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I'd like you to fill in these 2 blanks so that this picture of the environment is complete.
