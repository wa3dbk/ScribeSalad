We can rewrite 2 in exponential form as 2 to the 1st power, which means that

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:10.653
log base 2 of 2 to the 1 is just 1. Interesting. If we want to rewrite 1 as 2

00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:16.070
to some power, it's 2 to the 0. So it looks like log base 2 of 2 to the 0

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.879
should be 0. These are definitely some special values.
