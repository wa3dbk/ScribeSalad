00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.911
Our first solution to this problem is that we

00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:06.488
don't do out of order load/store execution, instead we

00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:10.160
do in order load/store execution. This is what happens

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.830
in that case. The load is a miss, the add

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.680
is stalled, the store is stalled because of that,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.130
because they're both, both waiting for the load to eventually

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.200
finish. The subtraction gets done. We now know the

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.732
address for this load. At that point in the load/store

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:28.924
queue, we will check whether there are any preceding instructions

00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:32.174
that might eventually resolve to the same address. Or even worse,

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:35.590
we check whether there is just all preceding instructions are done.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.692
Because this load is not done, we are not going to consider

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:42.124
this store for execution, that is for producing the value for

00:00:42.124 --> 00:00:45.028
this address, and as a result, we are also not going to

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:48.270
do this load. So pretty much what now happens is this

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.740
load here doesn't go to memory although it knows where the

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.470
address is. Eventually this mess is resolved.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.870
We compute R7 and then very quickly afterwards

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.220
we are going to compute the address for the store. So now what we have is,

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.880
this load gets done. This instruction was

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.380
already done. Eventually, the add gets done, and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.820
eventually the store gets done. The store is

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.840
considered done, not when it commits, but when

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.680
it actually knows the address, and knows the value that is

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.895
going to go to that address. At that point only, this load

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:24.982
is allowed to proceed because at that point, it can just go

00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:28.510
up and check whether any stores produced the values for the address

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.219
that we are interested in, and if so, just grab the

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.850
value. So the load can only finish after the store has finished.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.600
And the store will not do anything until this load is done,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.870
et cetera. So really, we are executing most of the instructions out

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.810
of order here. But loads and stores are still proceeding in

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.007
order. Of course you can see that this is suboptimal if

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.930
this store doesn't store to the same address. We have been

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.450
waiting here for a very time and thus we have delayed

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.013
all of the instructions that depend on the load. Worse, if

00:01:56.013 --> 00:01:59.256
the load would have been a cache miss. We were sitting

00:01:59.256 --> 00:02:02.480
there not trying to order things from memory, until many many

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.952
cycles later potentially, and only then we realize we have a cache

00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:10.169
miss and have to wait many many cycles more. So this is of

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.470
course not a very high performance solution, but it is a correct solution.
