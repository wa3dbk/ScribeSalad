00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.509
We've made a map,
we've put some information on it,

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:05.740
now let's make it yours.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.950
If you're designing a website just for
fun or for

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.900
a specific business purpose, the feeling
you want to portray can differ widely.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.320
&gt;&gt; Much like your personal fashion
choices, the style you apply to your map

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.910
can say a lot about the feeling
of your company or site.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.658
&gt;&gt; It can also help direct the user's
attention to the things that you

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:23.060
want to stand out.

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:26.686
&gt;&gt; It can reflect the classiness of
business or site that you're creating.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.519
&gt;&gt; Or it can simply be
a matter of personal taste.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.589
&gt;&gt; In any case, you'll want to make
it your own by applying styling.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.920
&gt;&gt; Google Maps come with a standard
style that most people are very

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.570
familiar with.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.309
The things that we're able to change
about it are called features.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.370
And they include things like water, land
features, roads such as highways and

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:56.429
local roads, points of interest, and
all the labels associated with them.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.719
Let's check out a few
examples of styled maps.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.206
First, here's a simple example.

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:04.298
We've changed the water to red and

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.840
set the hue of the whole
map to the same color.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.500
We've also turned off all the labels.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.739
Here's a pretty cool grey scale map.

00:01:11.739 --> 00:01:14.841
This could be great if you want to
draw attention to only a few color

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.000
details like markers.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.709
This is a good example of
a functionally styled map.

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:22.449
The user only sees the road elements.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.714
These samples are all from Snazzy Maps
and awesome site for pre-built styles.

00:01:26.713 --> 00:01:28.959
It's linked to the instructor notes.

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.310
&gt;&gt; Whatever you want to do,
you can do it.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.440
Let's make our own custom style.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.189
&gt;&gt; We'll create a styles array
in our initialize function.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.579
Styled maps use two concepts to
apply colors and changes to a map.

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.587
Map features are the geographic elements
that can be targeted on the map.

00:01:47.587 --> 00:01:51.630
Roads, parks, bodies of water, etc.

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:54.699
Elements are what about that
feature that you want to change.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.630
The geometry itself, the label,
the label outliner text.

00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:00.099
Stylers are the color and

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.629
visibility properties that can
be applied to the map features.

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:08.810
Map features and stylers
are combined into the styles array.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.479
Styles are cascading.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.724
So for example, if you make all the rows
red and then choose to make highways

00:02:14.723 --> 00:02:19.479
blue, you'll get blue highways and
red local and arterial roads.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.320
Also, unless you choose a style,
the map will stick with the defaults.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.072
We can craft styles from scratch but
there's also a ton of great and

00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:29.919
free options online
that give you starters.

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.375
And from there you can change
the colors, add and remove stuff,

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:34.340
make it your own.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.000
Just google search for
Google Maps API Styles.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.090
I'm using a set of styles
here I found online.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.080
But I've made the transit
station stand out more.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:50.238
At the same time, we'll set the styles
property within the map object options.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.170
Now, in addition to a zoom and

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.619
a center, the map object gets a set of
styles which we've defined above it.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.360
The map type controls parameter allows
the user to change the map type to road,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.310
terrain, satellite, etc.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.359
So we're disabling that
by setting it to false.

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:09.975
While we're being fancy, we'll jazz up
the markers a bit to match our map.

00:03:09.975 --> 00:03:14.490
I'm creating two new marker icons here.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.735
One is the default icon which
will appear when the markers

00:03:16.735 --> 00:03:17.493
appear on the map.

00:03:17.493 --> 00:03:22.469
And one that's a highlighted icon which
will appear when I hover over a marker.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:25.439
I've created a simple function
below to take in a color and

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.870
create a marker icon object.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.650
This make marker icon function
simply takes in a marker color and

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.235
creates a new marker image
using that marker color and

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:36.825
using some custom sizes and what not.

00:03:38.375 --> 00:03:41.944
Then, I'm going to go back to our loop
where we create all of our markers and

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:44.514
set the icon on each
marker to default icon.

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.103
Finally, I'm going to
add two event listeners.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:53.320
One for a mouseover event to change
our icon to the highlighted icon.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.099
And one for the mouseout event to
change it back to the default icon.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.139
This is going to make the marker
yellow when I mouseover it and

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.829
then turn it back to blue
when I mouseout of it.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.370
I only have a few markers, so
this may not be totally necessary.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.240
But if I had hundreds,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.760
this would definitely help
the user select the correct icon.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.150
Wow, that's a pretty funky looking map.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.780
I hope you guys like
neon as much as I do.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.670
Before you try it out yourself,

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.490
let's talk about one more
cool feature of styling.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.310
Custom map types.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.850
This sample let's the user toggle
between different styles.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:33.180
For a real estate app, we can enable
map types, for example, that can let

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.528
the user decide make subways and
transit stops stand out, focus

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:41.469
on neighborhood boundaries, or highlight
parks and other points of interest.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.580
Click on the link in the instructor
notes to see this sample.

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:46.969
Next, try out creating your own styles.
