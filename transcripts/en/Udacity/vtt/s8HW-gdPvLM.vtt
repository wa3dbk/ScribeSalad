00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.760
Copying rectangles and copying strings seemed to have different results, but

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.700
they were really the same process. We had two variables pointed at the same

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.940
object behind the scenes. Let's look at a different kind of copying. I make a

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.270
variable lucky number which is an int, and I set it to 13. And then for my

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.530
second lucky number I'm just going to set it to the same thing, and then I'm

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.050
going to change the second lucky number. After these steps, what's now our

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.137
lucky number? How about lucky number 2?
