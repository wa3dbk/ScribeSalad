I think the most important thing to do when you encounter an error is to take a

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.140
step back and breathe for a second. Usually it's some small inane thing, so I

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.370
try to look back through whatever part seems to be compiling incorrectly or

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.470
running incorrectly. And determining if I've, you know, misnamed a variable or

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.950
done something really small or inane and usually it's that. If it's not then I

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.510
like to proceed through the code line by line. And just sort of look at what

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.630
every variable is assigned to, and what, what's happening in each line in the

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.680
code. And usually by going step by step and slowly, I'll find the error pretty

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.130
quickly.
