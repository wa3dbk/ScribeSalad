00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
At this point, we have systematically fixed the first bug

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
using the scientific method to systematically come up with a hypothesis and refine it,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
refine it again, possibly come up with alternatives until we end up with a diagnosis.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So if you're an experienced programmer--and I assume you are--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you may now wonder, "Why on Earth should I actually go through all these

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.500
explicit steps if I can just jump into my debugger and fix the problem right away?"

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
It's actually likely that you have spotted the problem at the very moment you saw the code.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.500
If you're a very experienced programmer, you can probably spot errors like these

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
in hundreds and hundreds of lines from a distance of several hundred meters.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.500
You just look at the code and immediately see, "Well, there's something fishy in there."

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000
And all of this is, of course, right.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
There are many problems which you can immediately see

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
and which you can immediately fix within 5 minutes

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
including the one we just discussed

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.500
And it's perfectly okay, if it only takes 5 minutes,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.800
to jump right into your editor and to fix things,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.300
to jump into your interactive debugger and fix things,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.500
as long as it doesn't take more than 5 minutes--

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
because what happens if it takes more than that?
