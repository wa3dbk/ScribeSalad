00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For this problem, you're going to develop a semi-implicit solver to model

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
just a single corner of the car and its motion.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You saw the diagram that look pretty much just like this in the unit.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now all of these errors represent different types of quantities but they're just use for showing direction.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
V here represents the velocity of the car. W is the tangential velocity of the wheel.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Mqc is the mass of one quarter of the car

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and therefore, mqc*g is equal to the gravitational force on this quarter of the car.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
F here represents friction or the force of friction that is

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
acting in this direction against the motion of the car.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The force of friction is a function of S, which stands for wheel slip.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We can write out the equation for the force of friction just like this.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The force of friction is equal to, as you've seen before,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the coefficient of kinetic friction, which is the function of wheel slip, times the normal force,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
which in this case has a magnitude equal to that of the gravitational force.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can relate some other important quantities to the force of friction, and right here

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we can see that v-dot or the acceleration of the car is impacted definitely by the force of friction.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Change in the velocity of the wheel depends both on the force of friction and on B,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which is the braking acceleration.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
S here, as you remember, stands for wheel slip as I just said.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We also have this expression from U, the coefficient of kinetic friction.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Your first task in this problem is going to find an equation

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
for W at the n+1 time step that fits this form right here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In this equation, C, D, F, and K all could depend on a number of different things.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
For example, it might depend on W sub n, on h the time step, or the mass at the corner of the car,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
on the affective mass of the wheel, mew right here, mg the acceleration due to gravity,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
on B the braking acceleration, or on v the velocity.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
For v which you see right here, we're going to use v-sub-n because as it turns out

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
v changes very slowly compared to w.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In fact, what we have is a stiff system of differential equations.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You remember for our work earlier on in the course that stiff systems of differential equations

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
require you to use a very small step size or else we'll end up with completely unreasonable results.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
If you want to test this out, try plugging in h=0.1 seconds for the step size

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and see what kind of craziness this is.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
In order to figure out what to plug in for C,D, F, and K here, we want you to use

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the backward Euler method along with the information that we've given you here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Looking at the code, you can see that we've given you a substantial portion of the program already.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In fact, we've handed you a solver right here.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Since we're asking you to use the backward Euler method, which is an implicit method,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you're going to end up with an equation that is not linear and therefore, you can't solve explicitly.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Once you've used the backward Euler method to come up with values for C, D, F, and K,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
we want you to use this solver in conjunction with the backward Euler method

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to come up with an expression for w[step+1].

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In the solution video, I'll give you a more indepth explanation

00:02:55.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of what do solvers do and then how it works.
