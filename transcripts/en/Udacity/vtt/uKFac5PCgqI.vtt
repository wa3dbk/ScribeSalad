00:00:00.037 --> 00:00:03.960
Right off the bat, let's remember what slope-intercept form is. You've probably

00:00:03.961 --> 00:00:07.655
got it but it never hurts to write it down one more time. We want to get this

00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:11.302
equation in the form y with an coefficient of 1, or course, equals mx plus b.

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:15.157
The first thing we need to do then is to get our term with y to be the only term

00:00:15.158 --> 00:00:19.298
on the left side of the equation. So we need to subtract 12x from both sides.

00:00:19.298 --> 00:00:23.859
Then, to get the coefficient of y to be 1, you just divide both sides by 5.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.546
Then, if you're picky like me and you want the equation to be exactly in this

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:32.555
form, we just rearrange the order of our two terms on the right-hand side. We're

00:00:32.557 --> 00:00:36.561
allowed to do this because of commutativity and we end up with y equals negative

00:00:36.562 --> 00:00:40.266
12 5ths x plus 7 5ths. This is great. Now we can see right away that the slope

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:45.546
is negative 12 over 5. And the y coordinate of the y intercept is 7 over 5.
