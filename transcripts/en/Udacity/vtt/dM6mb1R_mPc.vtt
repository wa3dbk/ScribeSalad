00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Suppose you are sick,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and you wake up with a strong pain

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in the middle of the night.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You so sick that you fear you might die,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but you're not sick enough not to apply

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the lessons of my Statistics 101 class

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to make a rational decision whether to go to the hospital.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And in doing so, you consult the titer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You find that in your town, over the last year,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
40 people were hospitalized

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of which 4 passed away.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Whereas the vast part of the population

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
of your town never went to the hospital,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and of those, 20 passed away at home.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So compute for me the percentages

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of the people who died in the hospital

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and the percentage of the people who died at home.
