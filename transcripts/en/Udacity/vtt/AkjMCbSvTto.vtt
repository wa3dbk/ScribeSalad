Okay, hey everybody welcome to Unit 1. In this unit

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.780
we're going to be basically discussing the basics of the web.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.980
So, in this unit we're going to cover the web, what

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.260
it is, what it looks like, how, how their major

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.402
pieces fit together. We'll talk about HTML which is the

00:00:14.402 --> 00:00:17.610
main document type of the web. We'll talk about URLs

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.430
which is how you refer to documents on the web.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.310
We'll talk about HTTP which is the protocol that unites

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.750
the web, that the web runs on. And then we'll talk

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.470
about Web Applications and, you know, what they are and how

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.420
they fit into this big picture. And this is, you know,

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.580
the grand finale. This is what the course is actually about.
