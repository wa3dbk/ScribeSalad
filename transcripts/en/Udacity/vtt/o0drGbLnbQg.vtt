00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.058
We're going to look at how to solve an equation involving exponents by using

00:00:03.058 --> 00:00:06.668
logs. And then, we'll apply that knowledge later to the bacteria example we

00:00:06.668 --> 00:00:11.184
were working with at the beginning of this lesson. But first by thinking about

00:00:11.184 --> 00:00:16.325
how exponents work, what is x in this equation? We have 10 to the x equals 1

00:00:16.325 --> 00:00:20.359
million. This might not seem super difficult but it's always good to know

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.539
beforehand what we're expecting, when we try out a new method as sort of a

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.559
sanity check for ourselves.
