00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.861
You've learned how to create branches and

00:00:01.861 --> 00:00:05.310
how to keep track of which branches contain which commits, using diagrams.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
Now, let's take a look at how to combine changes from multiple branches into

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.190
a single version.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.200
Since the coins branch is finished,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.354
I'd like to incorporate the changes into the master branch.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:17.700
If no changes had been made to the master in the meantime, back when I

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.670
first started it, I could just update the label to be where I am now.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.860
But changes have been made in master.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.420
So I'll need to somehow combine the coin branch, with the master branch and

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.500
create a single version that contains all the changes from both.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.810
Git can actually combine the master branch with the coin branch automatically,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.160
which is pretty impressive.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.370
To get an idea of how this works, let's look at a simple example first.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.310
Suppose two people, I'll call them Jake and

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.820
Rachel, are editing two copies of the same file independently.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.490
You can imagine that this is the game.js file from the Asteroids repository or

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.700
any other file, really.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.100
At the beginning of the day, they both start with the same version of the file.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.840
During the day, each of them makes some changes, possibly adding some lines, or

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.420
removing some lines.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.330
At the end of the day,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.170
Jake's version of the file contains some lines of content.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500
We'll refer to them as B, D and E.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.750
Now of course, in reality,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.310
these would be lines of code or may be instructions for a recipe.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.620
But I'm using letters instead, so

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.790
that you can focus on how to create a combined version of file without getting

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.390
bugged down by thinking about the specific content.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.860
Similarly Rachel's version contained a couple of lines.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.370
A, B, C and D.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.270
Now, Jake and Rachel want to combine their two files into a single version with

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.790
both of their changes.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.470
For each line, mark whether you think it should be present in the final file.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.040
Pick yes if it should definitely be in the file.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.580
No if definitely not.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.400
And unknown if it's impossible to figure this out from the information you have.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.590
This is a hard question, so don't worry about getting it right on the first try.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.670
Just try your best and think about each line individually
