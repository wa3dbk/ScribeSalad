00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.400
So due to the client server interactions
that happen with the system,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.160
I'm giving you one
specific example here.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.490
A client makes a call to a file system.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.045
And the directory server
of the file system

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:17.945
makes call to the data server where
the file is actually located.

00:00:17.945 --> 00:00:23.255
So all of these are IPC calls, but
under the cover a shadow graph structure

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:27.985
emerges which is a trail of
the client server interactions.

00:00:27.985 --> 00:00:33.765
The client opening the file so
the TM on the owner has a link to

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.160
a TM on the directory manager and
the directory manager

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.930
is calling the data servers and
two different nodes and correspondingly,

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.600
there is a link from the transaction
manager on the directory server

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.930
to the transaction manager on the data
server on these two different nodes.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.990
So, if you look at it from the point
of view from the transaction tree,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.460
the client is the owner of
the transaction tree and

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.220
all of these sites are participants
in the transaction tree.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.610
I mentioned earlier that as
the owner of a transaction tree,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.620
the owner has the right to delegate
the ownership to someone else.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.080
Why would they want to do that?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.950
We think about it from the point of
view of the distributed system that we

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.840
are talking about.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.020
The most fragile parts of
the distributive system are the clients.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.500
They are the fickle minded
ones who can go away,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.539
who can abort a file request
that they started, and so on.

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.189
So in that sense if the root of
the transaction tree is on a client node

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.760
then cleaning up the bread crumbs may
become hard if the client box goes away.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.470
Because the owner will go away, and
that's the reason the owner can delegate

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.880
the ownership to any node
in the system and that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.650
node becomes the transaction manager for
this particular transaction tree

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.890
in terms of what needs to be done to
clean up anything that happens adversely

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.490
during the interaction that I'm showing
you in this particular picture.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.380
So the heavy lifting that Quicksilver
does has to do with what it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.820
needs to do under the covers in keeping
this order tree of transactions.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.540
Corresponding to the IPC interactions
from the point of view of recovery.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.640
Let's talk about how this
order chain is managed

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.570
by Quicksilver in order to
facilitate recovery management.
