00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's take a look at the first piece called the value proposition.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The value proposition answers the question what are you building and for who?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The value proposition says, "Hey, it's not about your ideal product,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
it's about solving a problem or a need for a customer."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is what pain are you solving, what gain are you creating,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and more importantly, who are your customers?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now value proposition is a fancy word for what product or service are you building.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is where you normally would list all your features and

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
here's all the speeds and feeds and benefits and whatever but we're really going to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
be asking a different question than might have been used to.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's not all about your technology. Your technology is just part of the value proposition.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Customers really don't care about your technology.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The customers are trying to solve a problem or fulfill a need.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
By the way, we'll be talking about this for multiple lectures.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The difference between a problem and a need is--a problem is I have an accounting problem

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
or I want to use the word processor, and those type of products solve a problem,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but they are other things that human beings do--like I want to be entertained or I want to have a date.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
There's just some basic hard wired social need or I want to communicate with my friends.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Like Facebook or Twitter. Those are needs. Needs are different than problems.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And by the way, if you could find products that solve needs, your total available market

00:01:31.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as you'll see later is huge compared to I solve specific problems.
