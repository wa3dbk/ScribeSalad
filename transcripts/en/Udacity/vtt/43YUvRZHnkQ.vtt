00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.665
Okay. Let's try an easier quiz this time with evaluating expressions. You'll

00:00:03.677 --> 00:00:07.101
need to remember how to perform operations with fractions. Here are some

00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:10.995
expressions. Notice, I have variables in the expressions. Here are the variables

00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.607
and their assigned values. A smile is equal to 3/4. A diamond is equal to 1/12.

00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:18.449
You can put your answers in these boxes here. Remember, if your answer is a

00:00:18.461 --> 00:00:22.060
fraction, enter it as a number, the fraction bar, and then a number. The first

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:26.738
number is the numerator, the second one is the denominator. Good luck.
