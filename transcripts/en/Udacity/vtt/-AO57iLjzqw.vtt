00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:02.320
All app is almost complete.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.130
As a last feature, let's give our users
a place to record the menu items they've

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.675
selected for a specific day.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.440
Here's our app in its current form.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.420
It displays menu items with the title,
image and details link.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.790
We want to add in order tracker that
will track what menu items have been

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.880
picked for a specific day and meal.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.740
To keep that modular we will create
this new feature as a component.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.728
We also need a way to let users
choose the item and the meal.

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:32.420
So let's add a drop down with
options for breakfast, lunch, and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.970
dinner and a choose button.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.430
When we create the order
tracker component,

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.380
we'll have HTML that will display
the selected menu item, for

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.250
a meal but how do we or how does
Ember keep track of this information?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.640
We need some data structure that
will keep the two of these in sync.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.880
This is what a service is for.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.670
An Ember service is an object that
can be used by different parts of

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.190
an application.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.320
If Monday is the active day,
then picking strawberry putting for

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.610
lunch will update the service.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.550
The order tracker is consuming
the service and will see this change and

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.050
update itself.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.910
So this order management
tracking feature is what we want.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.410
Let's build it.
