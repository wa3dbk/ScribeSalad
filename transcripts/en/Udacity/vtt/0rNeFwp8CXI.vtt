00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.900
An example of a distance vector routing protocol is the

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.150
routing information protocol or RIP. The first version of RIP

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.410
was defined in 1982 where edges had unit cost and

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.030
infinity. Where the count to infinity problem was 16. Table

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.050
refreshes occur every 30 seconds and when an entry changes,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.070
it sends a copy of that update to all of

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.060
it's neighbors except for the one that induced the update.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.150
This rule is sometimes called the split horizon rule. The small

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.520
value for infinity ensures that the count to infinity

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.300
doesn't take very long and every round has a time

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.130
out limit of 180 seconds. Which is basically reached, when

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.580
a router hasn't received an update from a next hop

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.570
for six 30 second periods. In practice, when a router

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.540
or link fails in RIP, things can often take minutes

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.660
to stabilize. So because of problems such as slow convergence

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.220
and count to infinity, protocol designers, look to, other alternatives.
