00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.450
In this section, we're going to cover drug research and that includes drugs as

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.614
medicine and drugs of abuse. We're going to look at both basic and applied

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:13.950
research. Meaning, the basic side is experiments conducted to gather basic

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.985
information on what drugs do to the body and the brain. And on the applied

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:22.348
side, we're going to look at ways that drugs can be used to help the human

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:26.490
condition. There's a lot of things we're going to consider in this lesson.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.452
We're going to look at why do people take drugs. We're going to look at how

00:00:29.452 --> 00:00:33.995
drugs work to produce their effects. We're going to look at physical and

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:39.132
psychological dependence as well as tolerance and withdrawal. We're also going

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:41.964
to look at how the root of administration plays an important role in the

00:00:41.964 --> 00:00:46.302
reinforcing effects of drugs. We're going to look at how set and setting can

00:00:46.302 --> 00:00:50.667
influence drug effects. We'll look at how genetics play a role in drug use and

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:54.263
abuse. We'll also look at how drugs are studied with animals and humans to

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:59.515
discover effective treatments for a variety of conditions. We'll also look at

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:03.740
specific classes of drugs and their physical, behavioral and psychological

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.280
effects. Also, how drugs are used to expand consciousness and very importantly,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.829
treatments for drug abuse.
