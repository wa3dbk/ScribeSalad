00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.760
Some traits can be obvious and distinguish easily

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.130
in whether they are learned or innate

00:00:07.042 --> 00:00:08.000
To help us illustrate this concept a little bit better. We have

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.280
asked some udacious friends to come in today and talk

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.880
to us for a bit. This is Clifton and

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.885
Eduardo and I am pretty sure both these guys have

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.870
the innate ability to speak, don't you guys?

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah off course.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.640
&gt;&gt; I am pretty sure these words are coming from my mouth.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, great, and based on their answers I would also

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.310
assume they would understand me if I were to speak in

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.820
english. And say science is amazing, because they both learned how

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.200
to speak English, but Clifton here also knows how to speak Mandarin.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.446
&gt;&gt;

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:33.741
[mandarin]

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:34.790
[mandarin]

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.840
&gt;&gt; And, what does that mean, exactly?

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.250
&gt;&gt; Oh, it just means, Science is amazing, in Mandarin.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.990
&gt;&gt; Clifton can do that because he learned to speak both

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.920
Mandarin and English. But, he may not understand Spanish, let's say.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.920
&gt;&gt;

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.800
[spanish]

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.960
What?

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.190
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.880
&gt;&gt; That just means science is amazing in Spanish.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.370
&gt;&gt; Okay, now I want you guys, see

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.172
if you can have a conversation with each other.

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:01.172
&gt;&gt;

00:01:00.172 --> 00:01:00.360
[FOREIGN]

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.040
&gt;&gt; okay guys. How's it going? Are you able to understand each other?

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.340
&gt;&gt; Not really. That's because you both have the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.970
innate ability to speak, but you've learned different languages.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.530
&gt;&gt; Another good example of a learned trait is something

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.010
like religious belief or cultural practice. Usually, people believe in a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.290
religion that they were raised in, but later in life, they

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100
can adopt a different religion, or even no religion at all.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.880
&gt;&gt; Another example would be music. You can perceive music and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.030
then you can have music that you like. Which one do you think is more

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.300
of a learned trait and which one do you think is more of an innate trait?
