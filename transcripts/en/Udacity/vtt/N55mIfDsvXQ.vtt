00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.260
Let's consider that we want to transmit a message

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.360
which is made up of four words, A, B,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.070
C and D. And let's assume that all the

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.330
four letters are used equally in the language. They

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.660
occur, the frequency of each letter occurring in the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.150
language is equal. So, you can be present A,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.640
B, C and D in binary, with two bits itch, each, like so. Which means if we have

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.280
a sequence such as zero, one, zero, zero, one,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.720
one, the six bits spell out the word BAD,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.060
bad. So basically we'd require two bits or symbol. Other way to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.630
look at this sequence is that you need to ask two questions to this sequence

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.520
to atleast recognize one symbol. So, two

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.650
bits per symbol also means that you have

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.990
to ask two yes or no questions per symbol.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.280
Now let's consider the second message to be made up

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.150
of the same symbols but in this case A

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.530
occurs more frequently than B, C or D. D of

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.080
course more frequently than B and C. and, let's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.800
assume that these are the probabilities by which we can

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.230
see A, B, C, or D. Now, we can do the same thing again, we can use the same

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:23.424
binary representation to represent A, B, C, and D. So again, we'll end up with

00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:26.190
two bits per symbol. But can we do

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.050
any better? Well, A occurs more frequently than

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.400
the others so can we somehow use this to our benefit and use a different bit

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.080
representation to get slightly less than two bits

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.390
per symbol? Think about it. Can you think

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.570
of a new representation that might be better?
