00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
And the game that I'm going to show you is called "Roadblock."

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.600
Roadblock is a game for 2 players.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.160
It's played on a graph with end vertices where the edges are colored.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.300
And coloring--well, in a way, it's similar to Shortest Tour.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.060
So in Shortest Tour or Traveling Salesman, each edge

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.700
had a number or distance assigned to it.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.400
And here each edge has a color, so you can have red edges, blue edges,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.940
yellow edges, any number of colors that you desire.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.730
And each edge has exactly 1 of those colors.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.450
Now, some of the vertices also have a label.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.610
Some of the vertices have a label that says, "player 1 wins,"

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.420
and others have a label that says, "player 2 wins."

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420
So the situation might look something like this.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.620
So here's the graph with end vertices, in this case, 11 vertices.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.020
The edges are colored either red, purple, or blue,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.020
and some of the vertices are labeled.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.430
Here we have the 2 vertices that say "player 1 wins,"

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.670
and here we have 2 vertices  that say, "player 2 wins."

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.290
So what are the rules of the game? Both player 1 and player 2

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.300
start out with a number of playing pieces that are also specified in the beginning.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.810
So each player has a number of pieces at specified vertices.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.570
So in this example I'm drawing here, it might look something like this.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.490
So player 2 might have a piece here; player 1 might have a piece here.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.340
Player 2 gets another piece down here, and player 1 gets another piece up here.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.260
So player 1 starts playing, then player 2 moves, then again player 1.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.340
So they play in turns, and here are the rules of the game:

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.020
In any turn, you can take 1 of your pieces and move it along the edges of the graph.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.110
But you can only move your piece along edges that have the same colors.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.640
So you can choose the color, but you must stay on that color.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.960
So, for example, player 1 could move this piece here, either to this vertex down here

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.920
or this 1 down here or this 1 over here; that would all be fine.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.020
Player 2 here, for example, could even travel 2 edges in 1 turn, or 3 edges,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.220
1, 2, 3, because they're all red.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.180
But what player 2 could not do is travel 1, 2, 3.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.870
Because then the color of the edges would change, along which player 2 travels.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.430
Each time you have a move you can change your color, but not during a move.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.590
And there is a second rule, and that is you cannot jump over other pieces.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.170
So player 1 here, for example, cannot travel along these red edges here

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.170
because player 2 has a piece here.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.380
And that is why it's basically called "Roadblock," because player 2

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.370
is blocking this road here for player 1.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.820
But, of course, player 1 could go here or here.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.990
How do you win this game? That is very simple.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.380
Player 1 wins the game if player 1 manages to place 1 of his or her pieces

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.210
on a vertex that says, "player 1 wins."

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.490
And player 2, likewise, wins when player 2 places his or her pieces

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.910
on 1 of the vertices that say, "player 2 wins."

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.710
It can be any graph, any combination of labels of the vertices,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.770
any edges, any color combinations of the edges.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.200
So you're given this configuration here as an input.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.420
The question is, can player 1 always win?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.220
Or, in other words, can player 1 'force' a win?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.500
And what I mean by that "is player 1 being able to force a win,"

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.730
means that no matter how smart player 2 plays, what moves he or she makes,

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:15.260
how intelligent and whatnot, player 1 will always be able to make moves

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.070
that will allow player 1 to win.

00:03:18.070 --> 99:59:59.000
So given this graph up here, can player 1 always win?
