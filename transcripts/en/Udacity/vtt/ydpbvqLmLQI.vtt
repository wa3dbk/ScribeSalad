00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.202
&gt;&gt; So we can see that this distribution is more spread out than this one. How

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:10.825
can we quantify this spreadoutness? How about we look at the maximum value and

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:16.648
the minimum value and find the distance between them? Let's say here that the

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:23.485
maximum value is 78,600 and that the minimum value is 21,180. And then let's say

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:31.281
here that the maximum value is 116,020 and that the minimum value here is 7,350.

00:00:31.281 --> 00:00:39.009
What's the range for this distribution, or the maximum value minus the minimum

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:44.083
value? And what's the range for this distribution?
