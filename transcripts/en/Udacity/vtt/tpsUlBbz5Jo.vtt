00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.916
So, here’s a new quiz and in this quiz you’ll

00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:07.400
be looking into densities that are non-uniform.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.647
In particular, I’m looking at the time of day

00:00:09.647 --> 00:00:11.746
when people are born. And, let’s assume

00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:14.873
for this exercise that it’s twice as likely to

00:00:14.873 --> 00:00:18.534
be born before noon than in the afternoon

00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:20.258
or the evening. So, if you look at the time

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:23.467
of day and the density for the time of day,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.850
I wonder if the shape is like this. This is

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.616
zero and this is midnight, right at 24.

00:00:29.616 --> 00:00:32.552
Perhaps like this or more like that? Pick

00:00:32.552 --> 00:00:36.000
the one that you think is most plausible.
