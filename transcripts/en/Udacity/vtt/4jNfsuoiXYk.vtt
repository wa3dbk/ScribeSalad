00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.610
My name's Ingrid Avenda単o and I'm an intern at Jawbone. I'm, I've been going to

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.175
school for art for three years and then I switched over to electrical

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:11.578
engineering. The reason I started that was it started off as a bet with another

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:17.560
friend and then the notion started off that I couldn't learn how to program.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.518
And I kind of feel a little bit spiteful, and be like no I can do this, I, I

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:24.995
can prove them wrong. I, I signed up for, or into the computer science course

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:29.785
and that whole semester like it was really, really like terrifying to get into.

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:33.018
Because I had no idea what I was doing, but by the time finals rolled around

00:00:33.018 --> 00:00:37.091
and I'm just. The whole semester had passed where I'm like, I can't do this, I

00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:41.203
don't think I can do this and I got my final grade. And then I was like, wow, I

00:00:41.203 --> 00:00:45.318
actually enjoyed this. Which was kind of something I wasn't expecting, but

00:00:45.318 --> 00:00:49.287
after that I kind of decided, you know what, this is something that I haven't

00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:54.890
enjoyed in years. Just having challenging problems that, like I'm excited to

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.240
sit there and program for hours. I'm like I'm going to solve this, I'm going to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.290
do it and so I decided I had to do something different and I decided well I'm

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.206
going to try to do electrical engineering. Its a little bit more hands on with

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:11.354
hardware. But I still got that programming element. So that's what leads me to

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.526
do an internship at Jawbone and I've been doing three years of electrical

00:01:14.526 --> 00:01:17.870
engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.
