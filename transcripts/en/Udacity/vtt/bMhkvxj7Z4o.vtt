00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.110
There's a cool little video on the,
on YouTube.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.730
Let me just show that now and
it explains how this works.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.830
I'm actually going to cut out
the section when it starts talking about

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.100
rabbits, but that's because you guys
already understand how stereo works.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.430
&gt;&gt; Microsoft's Kinect has a depth censor
that can tell how far away things are.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.920
In this stream, brighter colors are
closer and darker ones are farther away.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.360
This video will explain how it does
this which is pretty clever and

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.250
not how many people
initially thought it worked.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.940
&gt;&gt; By the way, these things
are relatively easy to implement.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.030
You can implement these things too.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850
Just hook up your Kinect.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.140
You can use, just write a little
program, or even Matlab.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.690
You can do it directly and display it.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.430
And it's kind of cool
to experiment with.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.870
The thing that I like about this
video that you can see well is, he,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.460
he sets it up so you can look at this in
a dark room using a IR-sensitive camera,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.480
which, by the way,
most digital cameras are IR sensitive.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.410
So if you do this, you probably look
at this on the video feed coming off of

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.580
your digital camera while you've
illuminated things with the Kinect and

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.370
you'll see it.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.960
Now if you take a night
vision camera and

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.380
look at the projection from the kinect,
you won't see a grid of numbers, but

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.950
rather a random speckle pattern.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.470
This accomplishes the same goal, though,
because no group of specks looks like

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.690
any other, so the Kinect automatically
knows the angle of every group and

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.260
can therefore triangulate
distances just like shown before.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.980
The downside of this technology is
that it can only work indoors because

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.150
sunlight would wash out
the speckle pattern, and

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.000
similarly, multiple Kinects
would confuse each other.
