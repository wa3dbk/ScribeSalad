00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.400
&gt;From the logs, we know that we have the right forecast

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.770
data and it's in the right format that we want as

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.860
an array of strings. So it's finally time to update the

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.950
UI. Think back on how AsyncTasks are able to pass data

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.090
back onto the main thread. You can hit Ctrl+O to see

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.880
the list of available methods we can override in AsyncTask. If

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.190
you click on any of them, it will be prepopulated in

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.220
the code for you. Then, you can update ArrayAdapter with the new

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.730
data that was retrieved by the AsyncTask. As a hint, you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.890
can make the ForecastAdapter be a global variable. That way, you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.300
can access it from within the FetchWeatherTask. Make sure that this

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.810
is not a static class, otherwise, you won't be able to

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.810
access the member variable from the forecast fragment. Then, go ahead

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.250
and compile and build the app. When you run it, and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970
you hit the refresh button, you should see a week's worth

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.320
of weather data for your location. Once it's working, you can

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.310
remove the verbose log statements so you don't

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.900
clutter the logs. As you're working on this

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.550
code, if you see an unsupported operation exception,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.360
make sure that when you're creating the fake

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.580
data, that when you initialize ArrayAdapter, you passed

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.590
in a list of strings, and not an

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.470
array. That way you can call the clear

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.040
method or the add method on this list collection.
