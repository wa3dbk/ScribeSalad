00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay, so let's jump right in. Databases.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The first question we want to answer is what is a database?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There's a number of ways of answering this question,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
but probably the simplest definition is a program that stores and retrieves data,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
particularly large amounts of data, or even more particular,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
large amounts of structured data, and we'll talk about what that means in a sec.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's go to the picture we've been working on quite a bit in this class.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We've got our user and his computer and the internet and our servers.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, up until now, we've been referring to these servers as basically

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
these are web servers running our web applications.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But in many cases, these servers are actually database servers as well,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and so we might have a special server just for databases.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A database can refer to a program that's storing and retrieving the data,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or it can refer to the machine running this program,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
or it can refer to a system of machines running this program operating together.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And just like a web server it may refer to just a program with a web server

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or the physical machine or the group of machines all working together

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to host your web application.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A request may come in from a user via the internet through our servers,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then we may need to retrieve some data for that user.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Let's say this is Reddit, and we need to draw the front page,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
so we need to get the list of links that we're going to draw,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we get that from the database,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and then database responds with the data to the web application,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which may manipulate the data and somehow get it ready for display

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and then send it back to the user.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But anytime you're storing large amounts of data,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you're probably going to be using a database,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.554
and that is what we're going to spend most of our time in this lecture talking about.
