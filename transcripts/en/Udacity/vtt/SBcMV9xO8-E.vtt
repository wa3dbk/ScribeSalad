&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here's our original systems again. And this time, I want you to make sure

00:00:03.852 --> 00:00:07.908
that you can check to know if you're right. Check the solution by plugging in

00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:12.087
the appropriate values into each equation. Then, carry out the math to fill in

00:00:12.087 --> 00:00:16.305
the rest of the boxes. You should wind up with true statements at the end. They

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:17.037
should check.
