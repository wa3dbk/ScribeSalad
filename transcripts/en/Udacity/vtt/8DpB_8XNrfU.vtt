00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.609
Complementary angles sum to 90 degrees. So, if I know the compliment of 30

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:09.431
degrees is 60 degrees, what do you think the complement of x is? How do we find

00:00:09.443 --> 00:00:14.454
the complement of any unknown angle? Write an expression in this box here. Think

00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:17.878
about how you found the complement in the last problems.
