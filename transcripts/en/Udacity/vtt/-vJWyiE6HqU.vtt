00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.490
When an architect designs a building, often one of the early steps is to

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.970
undertake a design study. This takes the form of a series of scale

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.240
models where different approaches are explored in order to get a better feel for

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.490
the design space, which is the range of possibilities available as solutions.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.680
The same approach is used in other areas,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.290
other areas of design such as cars, planes and even clothing.
