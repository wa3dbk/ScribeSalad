00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.198
You've already seen what the graph of x cubed looks like. So if we made the

00:00:04.198 --> 00:00:07.614
coefficient at the front of the term 3 instead of 1 but keep it positive the

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:12.809
overall behavior will still be the same. It's still going to start low on the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
left and reach up way high on the right. Since 5 x to the 4th times x squared

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.662
has an even degree. We know that the left and right side are going to point in

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:26.296
the same direction. Since the leading coefficient is positive it's going to

00:00:26.296 --> 00:00:29.818
start way up high on the left hand side. And then also rise up high on the

00:00:29.818 --> 00:00:33.737
right hand side. For this function with a negative 2 x to the 5th, since the

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:38.872
degree is odd the ends are going to point in opposite directions. And since

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.732
this leading coefficient is negative, it's going to start up high on the left,

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:44.830
and reach way down low on the right.
