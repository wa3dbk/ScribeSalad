00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.729
The first thing I'm going to do is get all of the x's on the left side of the

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:07.510
equation. So that means getting rid of them on the right. Since 2x is being

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:11.317
subtracted, we add, and then we have 5x plus 6 equals 12. Now, I need to move

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:15.309
things around, so that all of the constants are on the right side. Subtracting 6

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.607
gives us 5x equals 6. All we have to do is divide both sides by 5. And since I

00:00:19.607 --> 00:00:23.789
ran out of room, I will write our final answer of, guess what, x equals 6 5ths.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.807
So in the end, we get the same answer that we did using the first method of

00:00:27.807 --> 00:00:31.898
starting out by dividing by 3. But as you can see, this takes a lot of your

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:35.992
steps. Now, if everything on the right side of the equation had been divisible

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:40.009
by three, then that method may have been a little bit easier. But in many cases,

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.254
using the distributive property is going to make our lives simpler.
