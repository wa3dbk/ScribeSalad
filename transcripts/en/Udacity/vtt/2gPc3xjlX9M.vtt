Once again I have updated the graph class. So now it shows the old graph that we

00:00:04.447 --> 00:00:09.224
have this original problem, the orange one. And then above that, the new graph

00:00:09.224 --> 00:00:14.856
that we have of the equation, y equals negative 7x squared plus 14x. Thinking

00:00:14.856 --> 00:00:19.692
back to how we settle the problem at first, we say that we should let the base

00:00:19.692 --> 00:00:24.272
of the fountain be situated at the origin. This is why we wanted one of the

00:00:24.272 --> 00:00:28.591
roots of our equation to be 0. So you can see that we've got the fountain lined

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.937
up right here. This is where the water is spouting out from. Now, my question is

00:00:32.937 --> 00:00:36.782
how far from the base of the fountain will the water land? Assume that

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:41.011
everything here is measured in meters. So figure out what point on a curve

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:45.565
corresponds to the place where the water from the fountain hits the ground, and

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:49.400
then, figure out how far away from the base of the fountain that is?
