00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.230
A man that weighs 175 pounds should have 35 milligrams of the drug. Great

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.300
solving if you figured that out. If the proportion gave you a little bit of

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.016
trouble, let's see how we can set it up together. Because the amount of medicine

00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:16.372
varies directly with the person's weight, we want to set up this proportion, the

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:20.530
amount of medicine or the dosage for the first case Would be directly across

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.615
from the weight from the first case. 30 milligrams is prescribed for someone who

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:29.778
weighs 150 pounds. So this would be the first numbers for our first case. We

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:34.180
don't know how much of the drug should be prescribed for a man that weigh 175

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.384
pounds. So the amount of the drug, or the amount of medicine 2 is unknown, it's

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:44.353
x. But the corresponding weight for that drug dosage is 175 pounds. So we put

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:49.932
that here. Finally we cross multiply and then divide both sides by 150. This

00:00:49.932 --> 00:00:54.308
leaves us with x is equal to 35. Now I really think it's important to make sense

00:00:54.308 --> 00:00:58.217
of our reason through this answer. Should this be more or less than the 30

00:00:58.217 --> 00:01:02.974
milligrams originally? Well we said the amount of medicine varied directly. So

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:08.130
that means if the drug dosage increases, the weight increases as well. We know

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.988
the weight increased from 150 pounds to 175 pounds. So it'd make sense that our

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:18.590
drug increased from 30 milligrams to 35 milligrams. If anything, we can just be

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.883
sure that the second amount is higher, or greater than, the first amount.
