Let's talk about JSON Web Tokens.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.410
They're often abbreviated as JWT and
they're pronounced like the English word

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.420
jot, like,
let me jot a note down about that, Sir.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.240
JWT is a useful standard because
it sends information that can be

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.396
verified and
trusted with a digital signature.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:20.040
Additionally, JWTs are a compact means
of storing data that's easy to decode or

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.814
encode in most languages.

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:25.290
JWTs are also ideal for authentication
and information exchange because of

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.100
their size and
the fact that they can be signed.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.859
The most common uses for
JWT is authentication, and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.680
we'll explain how that's done soon.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.380
Since JWTs can be signed, you can ensure
that senders are who they say they are,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.790
and that data hasn't been tampered with.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.380
Now, because of the benefits
I outlined earlier, and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.910
because of their
simplicity to set up and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.650
use, we'll be using JWTs in this
course to authenticate our services.
