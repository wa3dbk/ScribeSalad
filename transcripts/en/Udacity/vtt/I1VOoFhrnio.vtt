00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:05.670
In Cycle 5 we will try to issue this next instruction which is a divide.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.250
This divide is going to look for this type of a unit and find it, so

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.404
we're going to mark that ML2 is not four. We are going to say that this is

00:00:15.404 --> 00:00:21.042
issued in Cycle 5. We're going to look at F0 and F6 as our inputs. F0 comes from

00:00:21.042 --> 00:00:26.280
ML1. F6 is actually in the register file, because this doesn't say so, for

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.700
example, if this load has been a little bit later, we would have to wait for it,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.910
but because it's done, we can read 7.1 and put it here. And then we're going to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.380
rename F10 to point to this ML2 which is where we put the divide. And that

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.230
concludes the issue for this cycle. Now as far as the dispatch is concerned,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
we have already dispatched this load and there is nothing else that is ready to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.230
dispatch, so we don't dispatch anything this cycle. In this cycle, this load is

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.740
still executing, it is going to broadcast as a result in the very next cycle,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.710
in Cycle 6, and there is no result that gets broadcast in this cycle either,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.759
so we are basically done with Cycle 5. Now let’s look at Cycle 6. In Cycle 6,

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.627
we are going to try to dispatch this ADD. There is a unit available, so

00:01:11.627 --> 00:01:17.601
we will succeed in dispatching it. F8 and F2 are going to be AD1 and LD2,

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:23.740
rename F6 to point to the AD2 now which is where we put this instruction.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.090
And that concludes the issuing of this instruction.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.930
Now let's look at whether we can dispatch something. Well, in Cycle 5,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.300
this instruction is still executing, so in Cycle 6 is going to write the result,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.480
but until that writes the result, nothing is ready really to execute, so

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.600
basically we don't really dispatch anything, but there will be a right result by

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.964
the load. As a result of this, several things will happen. First of all,

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:55.575
we will deposit the result of the load, which is whatever is at address 245,

00:01:55.575 --> 00:02:01.480
to the register F2. So, let's say that our F2 just became, I don't know,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.989
minus 2.5. We can then provide this value also to all of the things that

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:12.033
are waiting for LD2. In this case there are several instructions, so

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:17.472
the operant here matches LD2. So, minus 2.5 will be captured here.

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:21.458
And, we are no longer waiting for it. The second operant of this

00:02:21.458 --> 00:02:25.822
instruction also matches, but we are going to capture it here and mark this as

00:02:25.822 --> 00:02:30.811
no longer waiting for it. And then the first operant of this matches it,

00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:36.115
minus 2.5, so we are going to un-mark it here, too. And finally,

00:02:36.115 --> 00:02:41.958
because this entry matches LD2, we are going to change the RAT to once

00:02:41.958 --> 00:02:47.642
more point to the register file. So this concludes the writing of the result.

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:51.158
Remember that, because now these instructions are actually ready to go, but

00:02:51.158 --> 00:02:53.767
because that happens kind of towards the end of the cycle,

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:56.665
we consider that they cannot really dispatch in the same cycle.

00:02:56.665 --> 00:03:00.984
Because we are considering that we cannot first broadcast the result and

00:03:00.984 --> 00:03:06.370
then dispatch instructions that use that result. It's easier if we then

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.330
first try to dispatch instructions and then broadcast the result,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.710
because if we now consider what can dispatch, this looks like it can dispatch,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.370
so we need to remember that the broadcast has happened in the same cycle, and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.400
this really is not eligible for dispatch yet. So that's why we did, kind of,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.640
dispatch before broadcast. Similarly, it would help if we just did the,

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.030
you know, dispatch and then issue, and then broadcast, just so

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.020
that, you know, kind of, we don't consider things that have just issued for

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.570
dispatch. But that's easy, because only one thing gets to dispatch and

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.860
it's very, very quick. So in Cycle 6, we have issued an instruction,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.820
we have broadcast the result, and nothing really has been dispatched. So

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.285
now it's time to consider what happens in Cycle 7.
