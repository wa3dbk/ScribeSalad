00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.540
So what I'm showing you here is all

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.350
the events that are within a single process. Like,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.030
all these events are events within my process.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.910
These events are within expedia's process. These events are

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.920
within Delta process. And I'm sure that most

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
of you have identified all these as events that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.540
are connected by, the happened-before relationship and here

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.300
I'm showing you all the events that are connected

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.870
by the communication events. A is the message sending from

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.960
me to expedia. B is the receiver of the message.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.590
Similarly, C to D and E to F, G to H, I to J, K to L, those are all

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.395
the communication events. All of them are connected by this

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.570
happened-before relationship. And if you look at this event m,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.550
that's a concurrent event with respect to the events that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.940
are happening on my process as well as the Delta process.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.820
So those are the things that I've marked as concurrent

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.600
events. If you didn't get all of these right, that's okay.
