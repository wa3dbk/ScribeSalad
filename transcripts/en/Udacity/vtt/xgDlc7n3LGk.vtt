00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.364
So we've looked at radical form throughout this lesson. We know that this

00:00:03.364 --> 00:00:08.322
really represents a power divided by a root. We can also write radical form in

00:00:08.322 --> 00:00:12.750
exponential form using a fractional exponent. So let's work in the reverse

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.675
direction this time. let's go from radical form to the exponential form. Try

00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:22.492
expressing each of these radicals with one fractional exponent. Be sure you

00:00:22.492 --> 00:00:26.930
raise the entire radical to the exponent. Keep in mind that when you have

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.514
something than just a variable and an exponent inside a radical, you'd erase

00:00:30.514 --> 00:00:35.581
this entire radical to the fractional exponent. Here we can also simplify

00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.180
further since the 4 m squared is the same thing as 2m raised to the second

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.456
power. 2 squared is 4 and m squared is m squared. We're raising the power to a

00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:51.470
power so we really multiply these powers together to get 2m to the 2 3rds.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.488
These two should connect from what we know since. 2 m squared is 4 m squared,

00:00:55.488 --> 00:01:01.740
and then we have a root in our denominator, or a cube root. Take some time on

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.330
these, and when you're ready, enter your answers here.
