00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:02.690
Now remember the image that we had before.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.440
A tree, light going through a small pin hole, generating an image here.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.200
Now as I said, smaller the pin hole,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.450
the less amount of light will actually pass through.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.200
So this would be a much darker image.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.180
What we want to do is open this up a little bit more, so

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.510
more light will go through.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.640
Again, the size of this thing is going to be important as to the amount of

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.630
light that goes through from the obstruction to the other side to form an image.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.620
So one of the best ways,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.800
of course, to do this is to replace this hole with a lens.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.770
So here we still have our tree, our sensor or

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.530
a screen, and in place of this we want to replace it with a lens.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.700
But before we do that, let's look at the characteristics of a lens.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.800
Here I'm just showing an example and now I can add a lens in between the 3D

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.100
scene, in this case a tree, and the sensor.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.990
One of the interesting things about a lens is that when a ray of light,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.800
a wave front hits it, it can be made to converge to a point.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.810
And that's what we actually want to be able to do is we want to get all the rays

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:07.840
of light going in and hitting this lens and then converging, to a point.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.060
And then basically that would allow us to get a light pass from

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.540
a much bigger opening, as big as this, as opposed to just a point.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.790
But also we want to actually simulate exactly something like a point,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.340
where all the light would be.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.670
So this ray of light goes through,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.110
hits the lens, and, of course, now is converging to the screen at this point.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.850
A ray of light from the same point here will go through the lens and

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.180
converge to this point here.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.690
And that will allow us to create the top of the tree.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.310
And another one would go through the lens at this point and converge.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.170
And so all three lines are converging here, and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.890
this is how would I be able to construct just the top point of the tree here.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.280
And of course, rays of light are coming in from the entire tree and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.280
go through the whole lens to generate an image on that side.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.390
And this is how we get an inverted tree,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.590
with the resulting image simulated here.
