00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.135
So now let's look at the performance of MOVZ

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.130
and MOVN type of if conversion. In the previous quiz

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.360
we have already seen that branch code like this

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.820
can be if converted into code like this. Let's suppose

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.370
that this branch here is perfectly predicted, so all

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.930
we have to worry about is this one. And let's

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.124
say that this branch is 80% accurately predicted. And let's

00:00:22.124 --> 00:00:26.040
say there is a 40 instruction penalty on missed predictions.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.550
In that case, we have, here, this costs us four instructions.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.401
This costs us three instructions on this path, or two instructions on this

00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:41.470
path, let's say it's a very difficult to predict branch. So it's

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.530
not biased, in which case we have 2.5 instructions

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.370
all the time, plus 20% of the time, we have a 40

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.681
instruction panel. This gives us on average 10.5 instructions worth of work

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:05.220
on this, versus four here, so obviously, that if converted code is more optimal.
