Culture plays an important role in the foods to which we're exposed and

00:00:03.683 --> 00:00:09.034
therefore the foods that we eat. If you ever seen TV shows such as the Amazing

00:00:09.034 --> 00:00:12.382
Race or cooking competitions, you may have seen people cook foods that you

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:18.556
normally wouldn't eat. For example, on one episode of the Amazing Race, the

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:23.685
contestants had to eat frog Fallopian tubes. Now that was a delicacy for the

00:00:23.685 --> 00:00:28.213
people of that area, but it certainty wasn't so for the Americans. On cooking

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:31.861
competition shows, I've seen people cook testicles, chicken feet, and even

00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:36.782
brains. Now again, some people may find that a delicacy and actually enjoy the

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:41.646
flavor and taste, but many of us would not. However, if you found yourself in a

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:45.540
starving or near-starving situation, the chances of you eating those types of

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.035
food greatly increases. Now, we know that culture plays an important role in

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:55.170
the types of food we eat. But did you know that culture also plays a role in

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.180
our attitudes toward casual sex? We're going to talk about that next.
