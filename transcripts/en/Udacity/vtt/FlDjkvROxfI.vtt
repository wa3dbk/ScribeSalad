00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.140
Here is another fun quiz to get you

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.880
thinking about hardware, software interaction. And in this

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.940
question, I am asking you, what happens when

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.350
you click the mouse? And I'm giving you

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.250
three choices. One of those is the right

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.020
choice. And the first choice is, the mouse

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.630
click corresponds to specific CPU instructions. The second

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.760
says, the mouse click starts up a specific program

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.160
to read the spatial coordinates of the mouse. And

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.990
the third choice says, the mouse click results in a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.590
CPU interrupt. As I said, there's exactly one right

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.990
choice, and I want you to pick the right choice.
