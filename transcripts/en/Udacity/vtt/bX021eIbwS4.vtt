00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.240
One of the most important parts
of making high quality software.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.800
Is rigorous testing.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.430
Simply typing in test values into
a function won't get us very far.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.960
So to do real testing on large scale,
tests need to be automated.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.370
There are many types of tests, but

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.820
broadly tests fall
into one of two camps.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.990
Unit tests and Integration tests.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.690
Unit tests test individual classes or
methods in isolation.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.770
Whereas Integration tests, test your
code in conjunction with some other

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.650
systems, libraries, or environments.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.600
In addition to writing tests, we want to
automate the execution of our tests,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.140
more importantly, we want to integrate
test execution into our build process.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.980
The benefit of this is we can now
ensure that our tests are run

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.260
when our application is built, ensuring
that every change to our code is tested,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.620
reducing the likelihood of unknowingly
introducing bugs into our software.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.980
We won't get into the specifics
of how to write good tests, but

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.610
I hope I've convinced you on
the importance of testing.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.030
Let's check out how can help us
easily automate our testing.
