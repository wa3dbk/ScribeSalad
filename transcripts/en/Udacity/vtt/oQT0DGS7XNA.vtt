00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.200
Let's drill down a bit into a very simple connector, the procedural call

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.090
connector provided by all, all your friendly programming languages.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.390
First of all there's a flow of control, that is, control is with

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.320
the calling routine and then control shifts to be with the called routine. So

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.600
that's a coordination role. There's transmission of data

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.380
via the parameters, so that's a communication role. Procedure call is so

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.160
common, so pervasive a part of programming languages that it's basis for

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.090
all of the composite connectors, that is when we make a complex connector out of

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.440
simpler connectors. For example in the Java method call we have the caller,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.710
the callee, there's exactly one, at any given time there's exactly one caller

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.470
and one callee. So we can say the fan in is one and the fan out is one as well.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.500
Sounds simple right, but there's all kinds of variations. For

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.470
example,. How are the parameters transmitted? Well, there's call by reference,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.690
call by value, call by name. There could be default values,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.050
keyword parameters, inline parameters. If there's a return value,

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.730
things could be provided by invocation records, by a hash table.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.880
And even the order of valuation is a variant. Are the arguments which might

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.590
themselves be procedure calls, method calls evaluated left to right,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.810
right to left or whatever. Some languages provide for multiple entry points

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.210
that is when you call a method you may enter that method in different places.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.760
Is the invocation explicit as it would be in a method call, or is it

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.670
implicit as it might be in an object oriented line in which there's delegation,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.260
and the ultimate callee is known specifically by the caller. Usually we think

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.030
of procedure calls as synchronous but there are also situations where procedure

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.970
calls can be asynchronous. We mentioned the possibility of different fan ins and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.630
fan outs, okay? And then there's the issue, the variation that is allowed as far

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.610
as accessibility is concerned. We know, for example, programming languages allow

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.710
for only private access that is within the same class. Or protected access,

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.030
to the method from the particular class or it's parents, or children classes,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.610
and then public acc, access, where any other, the caller can be anyplace
