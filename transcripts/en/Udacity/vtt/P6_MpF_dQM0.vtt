00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.560
We just saw a simplified
explanation of direct.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.450
Here we see essentially the same thing,
but in the more likely and

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.745
more complicated case where Dr.

00:00:09.745 --> 00:00:13.775
Johnson and Dr.
Jones are connected to separate HISPs.

00:00:13.775 --> 00:00:17.495
Here, S/MIME is used to
encrypt the attachment

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:19.485
containing the patient record.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:24.870
SMTP is used to send secure email from
an email client like Microsoft Outlook.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.860
HTTP/S is used for
sending web mail, like Google Mail.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.190
The sender's HISP can discover or
find the recipient provider's X.509

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.150
certificate, their public key,
using DNS or

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.940
LDAP, two technologies for managing
distributed resources over a network.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.590
Once it has the recipient's public key,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.110
the sender's HISP uses it
to encrypt the message.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.150
It them uses SMTP to send the message to
the recipients HISP having used DNS or

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.150
LDAP again to find that HISP based
on the recipient's email address.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.180
The recipient's HISP
decrypts the message

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.730
using the recipient's private key,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.640
which is normally stored in the HISP as
a service to its registered providers.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.760
The recipient then retrieves
the message like any email, but

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.380
using the secure versions of
either Post Office Protocol, POP,

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.830
or Internet Message Access Protocol,
IMAP email retrieval.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.190
Which of these could be
a direct attachment?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.730
A fax TIFF file,
scan of a paper document,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.880
a printed version of a chart in
PDF format, or all of the above?
