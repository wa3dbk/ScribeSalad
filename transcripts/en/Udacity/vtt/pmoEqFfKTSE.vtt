00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.990
We can fit even more complicated
functions to data like this.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.570
I'm going to show you the code of
how to do that in just a moment.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.140
But I wanted to start with
sort of the result, and

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.340
then go back into the code and
show you how we did it.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.990
So our original polynomial
is a blue line.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.600
It's under here.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.510
You can't quite see it.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.120
And the noisy data, or
the green dots there.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.950
This purple line is our initial guess.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.210
And the fitted polynomial, the red line
here, fits the original pretty closely.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.000
So let me show you a little more detail.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.930
Here is output from our program.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.650
This is our original polynomial.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.530
It printed in kind of a weird way.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.914
Our original polynomial
is 1.5 x to the fourth,

00:00:52.914 --> 00:01:00.480
minus 10 X to the third
minus 5 X squared and so on.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.030
Down here are the results
of our optimization.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.880
So here's what we got instead of 1.5 for
the fourth power,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.170
we got 1.6 Instead of -10 for

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.260
the third power we've got -10.5 and
so on.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.480
But overall, pretty close and

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.600
as you can see by that chart I just
showed you, you know, very nice fitting.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.520
Let's look now at how
we do that in code.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.968
The code here for,

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:37.720
a higher-degree polynomial is very
similar to what we had for the line.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.290
Again, there's an error function
we're trying to minimize.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.160
And we take in the coefficients for
the polynomial and the actual data.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.660
And our error function is computed here.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.650
Again it's a sum of the difference
between the actual data and

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.555
the polynomial value squared.

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:01.730
We take the sum of all those values and
that's our error.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.930
So again very similar to what we did for
the line.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.740
Here's our function that finds
the coefficients of the polynomial

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.260
has just a few parameters.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.870
The data the we're trying
to fit our error function.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.250
In other words, how do we measure error
and what are we trying to minimize?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.910
And the degree of the polynomial.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.040
We created an initial guess.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.040
In other words, what do we think
the values of the coefficients are?

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.240
And what we're doing here is we're
just setting them all to be ones.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.900
We plot that, and then we call
our minimizer, just like before.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.110
We have to tell it, what's the error
function we're trying to minimize?

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.150
What's our initial guess?

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.870
We have to pass along the data, which
then gets passed to the error function,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.550
and again, this method, SLS Q P and
finally, you can't see it it is

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.700
off to the side there, but same options
essentially they are verbose options.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.730
And that's it that's how we use Python
to create a model based on data.
