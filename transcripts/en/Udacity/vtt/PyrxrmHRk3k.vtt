00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.310
Many of the functions we've been dealing with recently then, are rational

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.910
functions. A rational function is just the ratio of two polynomial functions.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.188
Let's say for example, that we have the function f of x equals x squared plus

00:00:13.188 --> 00:00:18.440
3x minus 10, over the quantity x plus 5. Let's just focus on the numerator here

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.158
for a second. We can factor this. If we do that, then what should we have

00:00:22.158 --> 00:00:24.930
multiplied together in the top of the fraction?
