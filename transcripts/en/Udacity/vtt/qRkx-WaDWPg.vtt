00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.270
Okay. So by now, you've heard a lot of

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.330
positive things about App Engine and how it can help

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.850
you build scalable applications. But let's do a reality check

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.880
here. Surely, there must also be trade offs involved when

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.120
using App Engine. Let's start off with programming languages.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.560
Since App Engine provides services to control the execution environment,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.830
it also has to set up programming languages it supports.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.350
This list has been extended over time, but App Engine

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.780
currently supports Python, Java, PHP, and Go.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.780
And since App Engine is an execution container,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.780
it also means that there are specific versions

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.130
of these languages that are supported, so this

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.960
is something to think about. Then moving over

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.120
to low-level controls. Since App Engine was designed

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.980
to create scalable application as easy as possible,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.400
it's execution environment also encapsulate many low-level controls.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.990
For example, operating system type and version, virtual

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.370
machine configuration, or network controls, et cetera are not

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.780
visible, and cannot be configured in App Engine. And

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.640
that goes for other things, as well. App Engine

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.020
strikes a great balance between providing the convenience you

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.210
need to develop scalable applications without sacrificing the flexibility

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.820
that you want. But with this in mind, don't

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.980
be surprised later on when you see App Engine

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.540
is not like a regular virtual machine, because it's not. All right. That's

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.040
it for the reality check. Let's now look at some App Engine success stories.
