00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And once again, we get 0.3 and the reason is, as we go up, 0.3 is being funneled into the function f.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
F starts over here and p is now 0.3.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We return then the value 0.3 straight from the input and then the return of this is being printed.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.549
Sounds complex--well, from now on all I want you to do is to modify what's inside this function.
