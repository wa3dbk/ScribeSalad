00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.549
Now let's do a little performance analysis here.

00:00:02.549 --> 00:00:07.958
Let's say that we have 32 adjacent threads in a warp that are each processing a separate row in the matrix.

00:00:07.958 --> 00:00:10.204
These rows may be different lengths.

00:00:10.204 --> 00:00:13.995
Will the overall run time of this set of threads be dependent on

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:18.027
the shortest row, the average row, or the longest row?
