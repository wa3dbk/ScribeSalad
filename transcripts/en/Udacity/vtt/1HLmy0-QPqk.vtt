00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.060
Inside a ForecastFragment,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.120
we're going to replace 
the mForecastAdapter

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.660
with a simple CursorAdapter

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.960
that will work the new 
database code we just added.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.676
This is another one 
we want to make sure

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.462
we're using the V4 version.

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:13.772
There we are.

00:00:13.772 --> 00:00:15.952
Make sure to select 
that in your list.

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:19.246
So you can see we have a bunch
of code that doesn't compile.

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:20.727
Since it's ArrayAdapter,

00:00:20.727 --> 00:00:24.171
let's switch our ForecastAdapter out
with new simple CursorAdapter.

00:00:24.695 --> 00:00:28.190
Now simple CursorAdapter 
is pretty cool.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.350
It allows us to map columns 
within our database,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.450
which are in our WeatherContract,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.993
directly to widgets
that are in our list items.

00:00:34.993 --> 00:00:38.666
So, all looks pretty good, 
except that it won't quite compile.

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:42.460
Because, this stuff we're doing
to start the DetailActivity

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.860
isn't going to work.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.070
So for now, let's just put this away.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.146
We'll get back to that later.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:51.572
We have something that compiles.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.000
But we need to do something first.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.060
If we ran it now, 
we would still get nothing.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.890
The reason why we
would still get nothing

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.840
is we aren't doing anything
in onLoadFinish.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.626
In onLoaderReset we might 
as well complete this

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:07.412
by doing swapCursor with null.

00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:09.240
Our code should actually
do something now.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.777
Let's try running it.

00:01:10.777 --> 00:01:12.564
And it looks terrible.

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:15.163
What's in the database 
doesn't look anything

00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:17.116
like what's supposed 
to be on the screen.

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.710
We need some formatting 
and settings help.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.054
More functions for our utility class.

00:01:22.054 --> 00:01:25.640
Get preferred location
did look a bit lonely there, right?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.060
To help us out, we'll add 
another function to utility

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.090
that tells us if metric 
is the current setting.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.930
We'll add a simple function 
to format the temperature,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.010
and we'll add a function 
to format the date.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.613
Now interestingly enough, 
what kind of date is this?

00:01:37.616 --> 00:01:41.520
Well, we've got two options, 
java.util or java.sql.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.030
In this case we actually want java.util,

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.210
but we're missing another helper function.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.920
We'll add a function 
into WeatherContract

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.650
that converts the db date text 
into an actual date object,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.010
opposite to the other contract function.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.383
So there we have it.

00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:55.992
How we store the data 
in the database

00:01:55.992 --> 00:01:58.871
is entirely encapsulated
in the contract.

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:01.470
So, now we've got 
all that cool stuff,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.140
but how do we actually use it?

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.427
Let's go back to
our ForecastFragment.

00:02:06.427 --> 00:02:08.187
It turns out there's 
a special callback

00:02:08.187 --> 00:02:10.955
for SimpleCursorAdapter 
called viewBinder.

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:18.700
Set viewBinder with 
a single function, SetViewValue.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.640
So inside of SetViewValue, 
we're actually going to make

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.740
really good use of those 
utility functions we just saw.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.470
First of all, we'll save off as metric.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.376
If we're using the 
temperature columns,

00:02:30.376 --> 00:02:32.472
then we just conform out 
the temperature.

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:34.280
Now that we've got 
setViewValue,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.740
let's put some cool stuff inside of it.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.710
You see that we use isMetric
when we're populating

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.140
the temperature in our views,
and we pass that into our new

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.530
Utility.formatTemperature function.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.770
So you can see that having 
these column indices here

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.150
allowed us to make 
this function more efficient,

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.380
and it will also help 
when we move into Lesson 5.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.640
One of the things you notice, 
is that the layout height

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.993
was really, really small.

00:02:53.993 --> 00:02:56.456
That's because it was
just wrapping content.

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:59.220
We can fix this by telling it 
to center our content,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.590
and by setting the minimum height 
to the least preferred item height.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.680
This will make things look 
a little better as well,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.590
a lot more like our original layout.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.052
So let's take a quick look to see
what all of this work has done for us.

00:03:11.527 --> 00:03:13.551
That's a little bit more like it.

00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:15.675
Now as you can see, 
we're seeing our forecast

00:03:15.675 --> 00:03:18.080
in the original way we anticipated.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.020
We can go to our settings 
and we can switch things on demand

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.960
but now we're in that
same problem I had before,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.640
we can't do anything 
to get to the DetailActivity.

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:29.385
Well, I'm going to have you fix that.
