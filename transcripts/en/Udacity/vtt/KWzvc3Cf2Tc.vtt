00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.437
So, for this quiz, your goal is to finish the crawler.py code to dump the

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:09.087
WebCorpus object that results from the crawl in the file named by the fname

00:00:09.087 --> 00:00:13.454
variable. For full credit, your code should behave gracefully, even when the

00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:17.468
file is unwritable. That means it should not fail with an exception.
