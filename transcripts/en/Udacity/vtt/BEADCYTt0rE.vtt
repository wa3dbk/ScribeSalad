00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now let's scroll down and look at the group function.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What group does is it takes a list of items

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and then returns a list of counts of items and the item itself.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It just goes through the set of items

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and returns pairs of the count

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and the set and then sorts them in reverse order

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so that the highest comes first.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And now this returns a list of pairs,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and we'd like to turn that into a pair of lists,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the unzip function does that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's a little bit tricky.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You have to look up the zip function and apply it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to the destructured list of the pairs,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but rest assured that that just pulls out,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
converts a list of pairs into a pair of lists,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and we call that up here in order to get the right answer.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, I'm always thinking about refactoring.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'm also always thinking of when are you done, and when is it time not to refactor anymore?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But I was having so much fun with this, I just wanted to try one more possibility,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and that's to say rather than have a long case statement

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of the different results, can we just have them in a look-up table?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so what I did is I took all 7 of the partitions of the numbers

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of the number 5 and put them into a table called "count_rankings"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and then had the corresponding poker ranking,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
0 for a high card, 1 for a pair, 2 for two pair, and so on.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And now instead of having a statement here that's a long case statement

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
for all of the 9 possibilities, I can just say

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that the result is the maximum of taking the counts,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
looking them up in this table, and that will give you a value

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
for anything having to do with pairs or 3 or 4 of a kind.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And take the maximum of that, and this expression here,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
which says 4 times straight plus 5 times flush.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, that might seem a little confusing, but what that's doing is

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it's using automatic conversion of booleans into integers

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and saying if straight is true, that corresponds to 1,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and if false, that corresponds to 0.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So if straight alone is true, that will give you a 4,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and that's the right ranking for straight.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
If 5 alone is true, that will give you a 5, and that's the right ranking for flush.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And if straight and flush are true, that will give you a 9.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And what we had to do here, in the previous results

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
straight flush was supposed to be 8, but it's okay if it's 9.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
All we have to do is take 5 of a kind and bump that up to 10,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and now we get the right rankings by taking the maximum of that.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We still have to return the ranks to break the ties,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but now in 1 line we did what took 9 lines before,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and you can decide is this what you like?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's nice and concise.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Or do you like the previous approach because it was more explicit?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And that's a question of taste. It's up to you which one you prefer.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now let's look at our lessons learned.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We always start by understanding the problem.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Look at the specification. See if it makes sense.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If it doesn't make sense, talk to people.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Try to figure it out. Consider different ways of trying to make sense of it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Then define the pieces of the problem.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
For our problem we had cards and hands and ranks and suits and so on.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Figure out everything there is to represent in the problem.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
As much as you can, try to reuse the pieces that you have.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We used the max function.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We used the random shuffle function.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Those were sort of standard pieces that we already knew about.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Make sure you write tests.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You don't know what you've done.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You don't know what your program does unless you can specify it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
both in terms of the pieces that you're defining

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and in terms of the test that tells you what is it that this program does?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And then explore the design space.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We have many dimensions for the design space.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We have to deal with correctness, with efficiency,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
with elegance, and with features.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Decide where in the design space you want to be.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Keep moving in the right direction, and use good taste to know when to stop.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I hope we've learned something from this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now let's take a look at some homework problems to really

00:04:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
reinforce these lessons learned.
