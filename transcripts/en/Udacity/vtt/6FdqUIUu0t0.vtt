00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.440
Layout includes help reduce
code duplication quite a bit.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.590
But for more targeted land adaptations
we can get even more fine-grained.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.240
Using all those resource
qualifiers we learned about,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.430
we can vary everything from
number of columns to heights and

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.070
widths to margins and
spacing and beyond.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.700
Let's take a look.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.840
You could use the w600dp qualifier
to variant integer resource.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.330
Changing the number of
columns in a grid of items.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.050
An integer resource is basically
a number with no units like pixels or

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.820
dp or anything like that.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.590
On a phone,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.970
you could have one column, which is
basically the same as a vertical list.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
And on a tablet or

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.530
with the w600dp qualifier,
we could bump it up to three columns.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.220
This approach works for
both grid view and

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.200
the grid based layout managers
bundled with recycler view.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.830
When switching from a list
type presentation to a grid,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.460
you'll likely want to use
a different layout for each item.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.190
To do this,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.550
you can access your column count integer
resource from code in your adapter.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.740
And use that to decide
which layout to inflate.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.420
It's worth noting that in
addition to integer resources,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.900
there are also Boolean resources.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.498
So you could have a Boolean like multi
column, which defaults to false,

00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:24.645
but in w600dp gets set to true.

00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:29.265
And then you could decide to use a tile
versus a card type presentation.

00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:34.785
Another super powerful technique is
to just vary specific metrics like

00:01:34.785 --> 00:01:38.945
paddings, margins, or
even button widths and heights.

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:42.665
Here's our same UI, but this time
we're defining the tool bar and

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:44.630
content view once.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.190
And specifying height and margins
that change on a 600dp wide screen.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.950
This technique is really,
really powerful and

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.110
let's you minimize code
duplication quite a bit.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.730
Here's another example.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.210
A full width button on a phone
might get too wide past 400dp.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.276
So you can create a dimension
resource called button_width,

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.560
that's match_parent on phone, and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.050
exactly 400dp once the screen was this
larger using the w400dp qualifier.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.110
Note that simply typing match_parent
won't work in dimension resources

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.890
because it's a special value,
-1, that doesn't have any units.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.940
Here's a quick trick that
works around that limitation.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.710
Just put this item tag
in your dimensions file

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.910
that's equivalent to
the integer value -1.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.280
Then you can reference it in
other dimension values like so,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.800
using @dimen/match_parent.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.630
And hey,
remember key lines from Lesson 3?

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.940
On smaller devices the standard
keylines are 16dp and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.930
72dp, but once you get to larger sizes

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.450
you can start using the standard
tablet keylines of 24dp and 80dp.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.140
This too can be done with
varying dimension resources.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.670
In this example we're
telling the toolbar

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.650
to inset the title from
the left edge of the screen.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.920
To the second key line.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.490
So we're going to inset by 72 or

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.480
80dp, depending on which
device we're running on.
