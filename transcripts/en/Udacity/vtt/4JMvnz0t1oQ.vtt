00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.014
This battle between static and dynamic typing is one of the longest lasting and

00:00:04.014 --> 00:00:07.612
bloodiest battles in all of computing. But there's really no right answer to

00:00:07.612 --> 00:00:10.937
which is best, it depends on what you're doing. We're going to stick with Python

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:14.010
for the rest of this course. But to be a complete programmer, you should have

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.770
experience with both static and dynamically type languages. And in fact, the

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.601
distinction between the two is starting to get blurry. There's lots of language

00:00:21.601 --> 00:00:26.429
that are primarily statically type, like C sharp, that include some dynamically

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.049
type features. And there's also ways to use static checking to increase the

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:34.233
likelihood that your Python programs are correct.
