So, the, the first thing to consider here, is whether or

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.940
not your specification stated what the input looks like. Okay? And, and

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.270
Jared, in fact, said it was a vector of integers. If not,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.230
then your program would allow the vector, apples, oranges, rambutan,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.430
physalis and pepino to be sorted in a meaningful way. Those, by the way,

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.070
are some weird fruits that I came across on Wikipedia. So you might say, and

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.470
which Jared did given is a vector of integers named X.
