00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.512
Okay, we've covered a lot of math so far. We've done fractions, we've worked

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:07.120
with multiplying, dividing, adding and subtracting them. Let's try something

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:10.779
new. Have you ever wondered why your skin cells get replaced? The skin cell's on

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:14.315
the top of your hand end up getting replaced. Eventually they die off and they

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:18.287
just flying away. You don't ever see them disappear, but they get replaced by

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:22.132
newer cells underneath the top layer of your skin. So here's what it would look

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:25.737
like for one cell to replicate. So let's start with one cell, and see what

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.395
happens. One cell is going to split into two cells. It's going to double. I have

00:00:29.407 --> 00:00:33.237
one cell, and another cell. Then, each of these cells are also going to double.

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:37.333
This one will make two cells, and this one will make two cells. And then these

00:00:37.345 --> 00:00:41.298
four cells will also split. Each one will make two new cells. So here's my

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.474
question. How many cells will there be after seven rounds of division. By the

00:00:45.486 --> 00:00:49.684
this segment, you'll be able to answer this question. We're going to figure this

00:00:49.696 --> 00:00:53.910
out using exponents. Okay, this is just one cell. This is before any rounds of

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:57.984
division, so I'm going to mark that off with a zero. This is after the first

00:00:57.996 --> 00:01:02.435
round of division. I have 2 cells. And then after the second round of division,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:06.937
I have 4 cells. And then, after the third round of division, I have 8 cells. I

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:10.470
know my cells doubled every time, so I'm going to use a base of 2. Okay.

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:14.829
I know I started with one cell, and that cell doubled. So I have 1 times 2.

00:01:14.927 --> 00:01:19.676
Then, each of these cells also doubled. So I have. 2 cells doubling or 2 times

00:01:19.688 --> 00:01:24.374
2. Then I have 4 cells, each of these 4 cells also doubled, so I have 2 times 2,

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.972
those are my 4 cells and then they're going to double. There's got to be an

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:33.470
easier way to write this. we're going to actually do this using exponents.

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:38.787
Notice that all of my multiplication has a 2. 2 is going to be my base. After

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.491
the first doubling, I have 2 to the 1 or two cells. After the second doubling I

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:49.996
have 2 to the 2 or four cells. And after 3 rounds of doubling, I have 2 to the

00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:55.335
3, or 8 cells. And after 3 rounds of doubling I have 2 to the 3rd or 8 cells.

00:01:55.455 --> 00:02:01.192
Repeated multiplication is represented by an exponent. It's very similar to

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:06.302
repeated addition, like, 3 plus 3 plus 3 plus 3. I know I have four 3's, or 4

00:02:06.314 --> 00:02:11.491
times 3. We use multiplication to represent repeated addition. We're going to

00:02:11.503 --> 00:02:17.136
use exponents to represent repeated multiplication. So, whenever I have repeated

00:02:17.148 --> 00:02:22.127
multiplication, I can write the base. Raised to an exponent. So whenever I have

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.675
repeated multiplication, I can have the base raised to an exponent.
