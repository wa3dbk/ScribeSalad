Now there is a new market and here, the customers are really unknown.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All you have is a vision and a set of hypothesis, and what you're hoping is you're going to provide

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for customers is something transformational--not just incremental improvement

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but transformational improvement.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And the good news is and bad news is that there are no competitors on day 1--it's pretty lonely.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So for this market to exist, you're going to have to create it through a force of will and a lot of money

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and that's going to require evangelism and education.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
An example--Groupon. Groupon single handedly created the daily deals market.
