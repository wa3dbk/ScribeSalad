00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.268
But we don't have to evaluate functions just the numbers. We could find f plus

00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:11.203
g of x. This would be the function of adding these two functions together for

00:00:11.203 --> 00:00:16.544
any number x. In other words I want to create a function so that way when I

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:22.082
plug in that number into it, I always get f plus g of that number. I want to

00:00:22.082 --> 00:00:26.242
have a function that can quickly add these two outputs together. So what do you

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:29.620
think is this function? Type it in here.
