00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.257
So the final new parallel pattern is something called recursive parallelism,

00:00:03.257 --> 00:00:08.415
and this is really interesting because it let's you do stuff you literally could not easily do before.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:12.616
A recursive algorithm would be, for example, a divide and conquer kind of algorithm.

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:16.586
A classic example of this is quicksort, which I think you covered in an earlier lecture,

00:00:16.586 --> 00:00:20.290
but it's much, much simpler and faster when you use recursion for this.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.103
Recursion is where you would subdivide a problem, and using the same operating kernel,

00:00:26.103 --> 00:00:30.999
you would apply that repeatedly to smaller and smaller subsets of data until you've solved your problem.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.037
We'll go into more detail on recursive algorithm later on,

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:37.674
but first, let's have a look at how you program dynamic parallelism.
