00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.820
In more detail we can express
the simplex algorithm as follows.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.430
First, calculate Rd.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.860
If Rd is non-positive,
well then we've done as well as we can,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.970
and we can just return
our current solution,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.340
B inverse times b in the basic
variables, and zero elsewhere.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.490
Otherwise, pick q such that
the qth element of rd is positive,

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.815
and then let dq be the qth column of D.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.375
This is the column that we
want to bring in to the bases.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:37.825
Next, calculate this column U

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:41.835
as B inverse times the qth
column of the Matrix D.

00:00:43.415 --> 00:00:46.215
If U doesn't have any positive entries,

00:00:46.215 --> 00:00:49.025
we can report that
the problem is unbounded.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:54.480
We can just increase the value of x
that corresponded to this positive rdq.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.360
As much as we want.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.070
If that's not the case,
then we find the i which minimizes

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.540
this ratio of Vi by Yi,
where the ui is positive.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.270
This tells us which constraint
we're going to run into first.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.370
And we let bi be the ith column of B.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.530
We then swap out bi from the basis, and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.380
swap dq in, and
we keep on repeating this procedure.
