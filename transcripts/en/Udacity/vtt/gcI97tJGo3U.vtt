00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.435
Here's the final render of a piece of cloth. It's a combination of the artist

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:06.360
determining where one point on the cloth has moved, then physical simulation

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.404
being computed. What you're seeing is a final batch rendering, but this type of

00:00:10.404 --> 00:00:14.676
simulation can be created and viewed in real time. Simulations that are more

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:18.614
complex can be run in the object location stored for all frames. These stored

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:22.178
sets of locations can be treated similarly to morph targets, with the animator

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:26.610
being able to blend among two or more as desired. There are plenty of other

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.250
combinations and possibilities of previewing and influencing the course of a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.360
simulation.
