00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.689
So let's now revisit the topic of cache
misses when we have coherence going on.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.460
We have seen that caches have 3 C's,
3 types of misses.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.740
Compulsory misses,
conflict misses and capacity misses.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.510
Remember the compulsory misses,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.450
we have them because we're accessing
the block for the first time.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.820
So, because it was never in the cache,
we have to have this miss.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.010
Capacity misses we have because
the block doesn't fit in a cache of this

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.160
size.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.950
And conflict misses we have because the
cache doesn't have enough associativity.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:40.800
With coherence, another C, we can now
have a cache miss caused by coherence.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.380
For example, when we read something,
somebody writes it, and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.290
we want to read it again, that would
not be a miss except for coherence, so

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.170
we call this type of
a miss coherence miss.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.770
So remember that there
is actually four Cs.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.460
The three we have seen before,
and coherence miss.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.780
There are really two types
of coherence misses.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.260
What we have seen so
far is the true sharing type of miss

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.760
which occurs when different
cores access the same data, so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.580
naturally we have to perform
coherence and thus have some misses.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.240
So for example if we read A and
then write A and then read A again.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.570
There are some misses necessary in order
to get the right behavior for the reads.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.910
But these were all
happening on the same data.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.300
There is another type of coherence miss,
called false sharing,

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.340
which occurs when different
cores access different data, so

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.030
there shouldn't be any coherence
messages because of that.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.960
Except that these data items
are in the same block.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.610
So it's called false sharing because,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.930
really, there is no true data sharing,
but

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.090
as far as coherency's concerned, we do
everything at the relative cache blocks.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.910
So two items being in the same block
makes them behave like the same item,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.400
as far as coherency's concerned.
