00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first machine that was built to do this was called the Heath Robinson.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It was named after this British cartoonist

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
who drew cartoons of crazy machines to do operations.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This one was for peeling potatoes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The timeline of this is quite interesting.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The first operator mistake--the re-transmission with abbreviations--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
happened in August 1941. That was intercepted.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Over the next year that was enough to learn from the two intercepted messages

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the structure of the machine and then to understand it well enough

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to develop this technique--the double-Delta technique for finding

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the correct configuration and to break messages.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
By December 1942 they decided to build a machine and put the resources necessary

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to design and build the machine.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It was requested to be done by June of 1943.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It was actually delivered 3 months early.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
By April 1943 they had the first machine delivered and operational.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It could process messages about 2000 characters per second.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was able to do 7 XOR operations at 20 km per hour.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This was not quite fast enough.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
A lot of the value in decrypting messages, especially in war time,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is being able to decrypt them before what the message is describing actually happen.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
They built a faster machine.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The faster machine was called "Colossus."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This was operational by January 1944, and the big change that made Colossus much faster

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and more useful than the Heath Robinson machines

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
was that they replaced the configurations, which were previously on a tape,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
with an electronic keytext generator.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The logic is doing all the XORs and counting the number that are zero.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Then it's printing out those tallies so you can go back and find the right configuration.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The ciphertext is still on a paper tape.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is spinning through about 50 km an hour.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It was a pretty impressive sight when it was operating.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Processing 5000 characters per second.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
What made this arguably the first computer was because of electronic keytext

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
this logic was a little bit programmable.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It didn't do always exactly the same thing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
There were ways to program it to do slightly different operations depending on

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
what the analysts through was the most useful thing to do with that intercepted cipher text.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This is arguably the first programmable digital electronic computer.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It wasn't fully programmable. It wasn't a general purpose computer.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
But it could be programmed to change its behavior slightly.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You can see what this looked like during World War II.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There are very few pictures of it. This was a very secretive operation.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The machines were actually all destroyed after the war.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
A lot of the value in breaking a cipher is to make sure that no one else knows you've broken it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This is different from academic cryptography where people

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
like to publicized when they break ciphers.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In military cryptography the whole value of breaking a cipher is your enemy keeps using it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
You want to keep it very secretive that you've done that.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
A lot of the work on Colossus was not declassified until the mid-90s.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Today if you visit Bletchley Park you can see a replica, a rebuilt version of Colossus.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is my picture of it from 2004.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It does look very similar to the black and white picture from World War II.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Unfortunately, they don't operate it frequently, so you won't get to see the tape

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
spinning through at 50 km an hour and all the crunching going on

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
unless you're very lucky to go one of the few days a year that they might actually operate it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
These Colossus machines had a huge impact on World War II.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
By the end of the war there were 10 of them continuously operating at Bletchley Park

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
decrypting all the traffic that they could intercept.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
They decoded over 63 million letters of messages in Axis communications.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Among the things they learned from them were the troop locations of Axis on D-Day.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This was very helpful for planning the operation.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Why did I tell you this story?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
First of all it is an important story in the history of both the world as well as computing,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
but this isn't meant to be a history class, although I certainly like to have historical excursions when I can.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It's also very relevant to modern cryptanalysis.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Modern ciphers are much better than the Lorenz cipher,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and the main reason for that is we can use computing power to do the encryption.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But the basic ideas are actually quite similar.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The goal of the cipher is hide all the statistical properties that are inherent in the message,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and they're present in the key--at least the generated key.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The actual key we hope is perfectly random.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Finding perfect randomness and getting it in computing is quite challenging.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But let's assume we have a perfectly random key.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
What we learned from the perfect cipher analysis

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is that the key must be shorter than the message.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That means in order for the cipher to work,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we need to generate more key bits than we actually have.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Even if the original key--and you can think of that in the case of Colossus

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
as the configuration of the machine that comes from some code book

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that could be perfectly randomly generated and shared between endpoints.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That is only the starting configuration.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There is some larger key that has to be generated to produce the cipher text.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So both the key and the message have some statistical properties.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The goal of cipher is to hide all those properties.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The goal of the analyst is to find statistical properties in the cipher text

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and then to use those to break the key or the message.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
In the case of Bletchley Park breaking the Lorenz cipher, they found statistical properties.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
When you looked across channels at subsequent letters,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
there were some statistical properties that were not hidden by the cipher.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That was because of a mechanical weakness that all the S wheels either all moved or didn't move.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
That meant that instead of having the long period with no repetition of 19 million letters

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that the users of those Lorenz machines thought it had,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the Allies could break that down and find a pattern that was only 12,071 letters long

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
with much fewer configurations to try to have a good guess of the cipher

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
with many fewer guesses needed.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
In a modern cipher we think of that as a mathematical weakness.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
There's some problem is the mathematics of the cipher

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that leaves some statistical property that a cryptanalyst could exploit.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The other relevance to modern cryptanalysis is it's really lots of hard work to do that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I find it quite amazing what Bletchley Park was able to do with Colossus.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It still took 6 months of effort looking at those two messages to figure out the key

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and interpret the key structure from that.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
That requires an awful lot of trial and error and a lot of creativity but also a lot of tedious work.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
In modern cryptanalysis we try to do as much of the tedious work as possible by computers,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but there is still lots of hard work that goes into breaking a cipher.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Motivation certainly helps a lot for that.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
In the case of Bletchley Park, the fear that your country was under attack

00:06:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
is a pretty strong motivation.
