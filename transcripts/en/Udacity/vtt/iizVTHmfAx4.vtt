00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.401
Fantastic work if you've got 12 n divided by 5. This 3 n minus 6 might have

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:08.076
given you trouble so let's see how to do it. We changed division to

00:00:08.076 --> 00:00:12.442
multiplication, and multiplied by the reciprocal of our second fraction. Also

00:00:12.442 --> 00:00:16.158
you might have noticed that I factored a 3 from the first two terms in the

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:19.710
numerator. I factored this and since I knew I was going to be multiplying my

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.919
numerators and my denominators together. I want to be able to find factors that

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.538
reduce to 1. You don't need to show all your simplification at once. So a lot of

00:00:27.538 --> 00:00:31.740
times I think it's best to rewrite what's remaining. When we write out all the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.657
factors, we can see that the 5s would reduce to 1 and one n would reduce to 1,

00:00:37.657 --> 00:00:40.354
leaving us with 12 n divided by 5.
