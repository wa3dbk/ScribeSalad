00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.360
We'd like the cross bar switching algorithm to achieve

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.260
what's called a maximal matching. Conceptually we have a router

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.000
with n inputs and n outputs, but of course the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.130
inputs are also outputs. It's just easier to think about

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.580
the inputs and the outputs being separate when we

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.690
talk about the switching problem. Now in each time slot,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.600
we would like to achieve a one-to-one mapping between inputs

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.770
and outputs, which is a matching. And our goal is

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.950
that the matching should be maximal. So in a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.300
particular time slot, we might have a certain set

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.950
of traffic demands, or traffic at certain input ports,

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.220
that is destined for certain output ports. And our goal

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.650
is, given these demands, to produce a matching that

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.340
is maximal and fair. Now, given demands for a particular

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.360
time slot and the resulting matching, notice that certain

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.150
demands were not satisfied. These packets that arrived at inputs

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.840
must wait until the next time slot to be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.430
forwarded to the appropriate output port, because they couldn't

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.210
be matched in the same time slot as those

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.525
shown here. Remember that there must be exactly a

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:05.810
one-to-one matching between any inputs and outputs in a

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.060
particular time slot. Most router crossbars have a notion

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.000
of speedup whereby multiple matchings can be performed in

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.420
the same time slot. So for example, if the line

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.100
cards are running at, say, ten gigabits per

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.980
second, then running the interconnect twice as fast

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.180
would allow matchings to occur twice as fast

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.960
as packets would arrive on the inputs or be

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.280
forwarded from the outputs. It is thus common

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.150
practice to run the interconnect at a higher

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.870
speed than the input and output ports. Just

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.570
speeding up the interconnect does not solve all problems.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.640
Note, for example, that in this set of

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.220
demands we have packets arriving at this input

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.950
port destined for this output port, but if

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.610
there's only a single queue at this input,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.740
the packets that are destined for the output

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.200
port, circled in orange, might actually be blocked

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.570
behind a set of packets that are destined for other output ports. So even if we

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.600
could induce a speed up at the interconnect, certain packets may be blocked

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.130
in the queue by packets ahead of them destined for other output ports.
