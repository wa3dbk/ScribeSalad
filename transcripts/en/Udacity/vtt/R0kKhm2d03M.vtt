00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In the second situation, the front of the car will lower more when we brake.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
To see that, let's look at the center of mass.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In this situation, the center of the mass is put to the back of the car--may be it's here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In this situation, it's put up--may be it's here. Now let's look at the forces due to friction and the levers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We can see that in the second situation, the levers get longer

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and the angle between the forces and the levers is closer to perpendicular.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So there are two reasons for this car is pushed stronger in the clockwise fashion,

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
which means that its front lowers more.
