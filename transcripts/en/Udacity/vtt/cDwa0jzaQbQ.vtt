00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.703
So let's see how to compute the node that's 2 hops away.

00:00:02.703 --> 00:00:07.278
We simply look at our node that's 1 hop away and take its node that's 1 hop away,

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:12.298
and we'll continue as long as the number of hops away isn't greater than number of nodes.

00:00:12.298 --> 00:00:18.487
So let's do an example here; we know that the successor--the node that's 1 hop away from node 0 is node 5,

00:00:18.487 --> 00:00:21.533
so if we want to compute the node that's 2 hops away from 0,

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:27.331
we'll look to see that the successor to 0 is 5, and the successor to 5 is 2, so we'll fill in a 2 here.

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:32.331
The successor to 1 is 6, and the successor to 6 is node 3, so we'll fill in a 3 here.

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.921
The successor to node 2 is 7,

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:38.819
the successor to node 7 is node 4, so we'll fill in a 4 here.

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:41.443
And notice this is a perfectly data parallel operation.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:46.029
Each one of these vertices can do this computation completely in parallel.
