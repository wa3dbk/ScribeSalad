00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.900
The answer is, it counts all of the non-vowels. Result is being used as a

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.540
counter variable. It starts at zero. And then we look at each letter and word.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.162
We get the letter out of the word using substring. And then make a string,

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:18.688
which is all of the lower case vowels. We take the letter that we got out of

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:26.004
word. And convert it to lowercase. So, A and A both become A. And then we check

00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:31.440
if this string contains whatever the result of that was. If AEIOU doesnt't

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:37.410
contain the lowercase version of the letter, then we increment the result. So

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.610
result goes up when we see a non-vowel.
