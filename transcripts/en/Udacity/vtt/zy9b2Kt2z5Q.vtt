00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.526
So let’s look at these distributions over here.

00:00:02.526 --> 00:00:05.370
They are really interesting. In the first case,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.041
you get something like this: just the counts . In the

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:11.762
second case, it looks more like this. In the

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:14.373
third case and in the fourth case, we get

00:00:14.373 --> 00:00:16.794
something that looks really interesting, like

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:18.471
this form over here. So here is a question

00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:20.314
for you. What happens when N equals

00:00:20.314 --> 00:00:22.676
10,000? When I draw it like a diagram like

00:00:22.676 --> 00:00:27.627
this, will it look like that, like that, like that?

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:31.000
Check the one that looks most plausible.
