00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.375
This is our simplified expression, 8a divided by the quantity a plus 5. We can

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:09.947
start factoring the numerator by removing a common factor of 8a from each term.

00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:14.870
This leaves us with a second factor of a plus 4. This denominator is actually

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.774
identical to the last problem we looked at. The x has been replaced with a. So

00:00:18.774 --> 00:00:25.036
we have the same factors, a plus 5 and a plus 4. We just have a instead of x. We

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:29.489
cancel the common factor of a plus four in the numerator and denominator,

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.634
leaving us with eight a divided by a plus five. Keep in mind these are both

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.367
positive ones, so we wouldn't need to change anything in terms of signs.

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:41.472
Sometimes our two factors might reduce to negative one. In that case we would

00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:46.156
need to multiply our expression by a negative one. We would have a negative sign

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:46.813
in front.
