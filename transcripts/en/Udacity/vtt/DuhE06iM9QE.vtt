00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The answer is the first choice.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We know that this is the case because this set has n - 1 elements.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We also know that there are no duplicates in this set,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because we know that n is prime and a is not divisible by n.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That means that this will generate the numbers 1 through n - 1 in some order,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
some permutation of those, but since it's a set, it's the same as the set 1 through n -1.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This turns out to be a useful property for proving Fermat's Little Theorem,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
because we can set these two things as equal

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and multiply all the elements in those sets.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Since we know they're the same set, we know that their products are also equal.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This product is (n - 1)!.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Since the sets contain the same elements, we know their products also must be equal.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So this is the product of the first set. This is the product of the second set.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's (n - 1)!, because it's multiplying all those numbers up to n - 1, and mod n--those must be equal.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We took the mod n out of each of these terms, but that's fine.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Then we can simplify this, taking out the a's.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If we take out all the a's what we have is (1  2  3  ...  n - 1)a still equal to (n - 1)! mod n.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now we can separate those, taking out all the numbers at all the a's,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
so we'll have n - 1 terms.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We have n^(n - 1) here times all the numbers is still equal to (n - 1)!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is the same as (n - 1)!.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now we can remove these terms, and we're left with exactly what we wanted--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that a^(n - 1)! is congruent to 1 mod n.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
This is pretty close to what we want, but we needed for Euler's theorem

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and what we'll need for the RSA correctness proof is this property with φ(n).

00:01:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's different from what we have here.
