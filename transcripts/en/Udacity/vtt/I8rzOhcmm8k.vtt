00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.931
We can use reduction to combine these 8 local histograms into a single global histogram.

00:00:05.954 --> 00:00:11.346
So how do we do this? We simply reduce the first bin of each of the 8 local histograms.

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:14.515
That's an 8-item reduction, and we can do that with a reduction trait.

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.683
Then we reduce the second bin. And then the third bin.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:21.245
Recall that reduction requires a binary associative operator.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.345
Note that adding 2 histograms together,

00:00:23.345 --> 00:00:27.714
2 entire histograms of 3 bins each, is both binary and associative.

00:00:27.714 --> 00:00:30.546
So it might be more efficient to figure out how to add 2 histograms

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:32.630
together during the reduction implementation,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.543
rather than adding each bin separately.
