Well what's happening, is that the attendance,

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.870
is on a scale vastly different than the scale of the web page's pixels.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.250
Remember, attendance was on the order of millions and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.780
while we properly scaled the center x and center y,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.000
to correspond to the correct x and y pixel of the latitude and

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.950
longitude of the game, we never created a scale for our attendance values.
