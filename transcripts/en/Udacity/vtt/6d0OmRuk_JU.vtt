00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.090
A row class of 100% of the page width.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.080
Well, this seems pretty necessary because we want each row of columns to take up

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.980
as much space as they can.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.840
So we will check that off because we need it.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.460
That means that we won't need a row of one twelfth of the page width

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.240
because we're going to cut up the row into columns.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.920
Are we only going to need a column of one twelfth of the page width?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.580
No.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.950
In fact, we're going to need columns of everything between one twelfth and

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.890
12 over 12 page widths.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.420
By defining columns for any size between 1 over 12 and

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.610
12 over 12 page widths, we'll be able to create content and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.830
columns that takes up as much or as little of the grid as we'd like.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.100
This means that of course this last answer can't be right because only

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.590
creating these three classes won't give us enough flexibility.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.510
It's worth noting that the fraction 1 over 12 is equivalent to 8.33%,

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.650
2 over 12 is equal to 16.66% and so

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.800
on all the way up to 12 over 12 being equal to 100%.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.070
You'll be using these numbers soon.
