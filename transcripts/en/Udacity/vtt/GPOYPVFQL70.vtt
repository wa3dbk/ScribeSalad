00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.982
So I think one of the really unique things about computer programming is that,

00:00:04.982 --> 00:00:09.310
the first time you run your program, it's not going to work. And you shouldn't

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.790
expect it to work. And people get really frustrated, because that's not

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.640
something that they've seen in other places. And so my advice for anyone

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.050
learning to computer program, whatever point you're at, would be to fail

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.570
forward. It's about writing code, and running a program, and having it not

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.090
compile. And not run. And while that can be really, really frustrating, you'll

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.710
see that bug ten times later and you'll understand why that bug is there. And

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.475
you'll be faster at it. And in the end, you don't when your program just runs,

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:46.660
because you don't fundamentally understand why that happened. And so. Just fell

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.660
forward and learn from your mistakes and be okay with this kind of incremental

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.230
process.
