00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.330
At this point, we have seen some examples of

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.070
things that might go wrong with the software architecture. So

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.220
I'd like to ask you also to recap some of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.800
the concepts that we've touched upon. What are ideal characteristics

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.526
of an architectural design? And I'm showing you three possibilities

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:16.970
here: scalability, low cohesion, and low coupling. And some of

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.260
these concepts we did not explicitly define, but we talked

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.400
about it when discussing the examples that we just saw.
