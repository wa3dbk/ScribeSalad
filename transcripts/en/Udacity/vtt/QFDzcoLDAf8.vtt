00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.640
Here's our change of base formula again. And if we use that, we can convert log

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.640
base 5 of 9 to equal log base 10 of 9, over log base 10 of 5. This is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:16.640
calculator appropriate, so let's plug it in. Log base 10 of 9 divided by log

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.860
base 10 of 5 is equal to this decimal. This is great. Now we know how to find a

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.459
number that pretty much any log expression with numbers is equal to.
