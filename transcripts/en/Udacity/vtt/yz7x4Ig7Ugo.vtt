00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.078
When we transformed f of x equals 4 over x minus 1 plus 1 into a single

00:00:04.078 --> 00:00:08.888
fraction, by converting this 1 to have the same denominator as the first term,

00:00:08.888 --> 00:00:15.705
we end up with, x plus 3 over x minus 1. So, you can see that yes, in fact,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.791
this is a rational function, since both of these are polynomials.
