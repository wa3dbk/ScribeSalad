00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.017
Remember the information we were given about the three different brands of

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.202
cleaning solution. Using this information, can you create an equation in the

00:00:08.214 --> 00:00:12.133
form of the word equation we just came up with, but make it so that it only

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:16.402
involves numbers and variables? For those variables, I'd like you to let total

00:00:16.414 --> 00:00:20.603
cost equal y, and the number of gallons ordered equal x. So, create a different

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:22.001
equation for each company.
