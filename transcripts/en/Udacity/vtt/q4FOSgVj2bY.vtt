00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.635
Now such applications are what are called

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:05.460
N-tier applications because if you look at the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.600
software stack that comprises an application such

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.770
as this, you'll see several different layers. You

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.550
have a presentation layer. And the presentation

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.520
layer is the one that is responsible for

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.190
painting the screen on your browser. Perhaps

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.390
dynamically generating the page based on the request

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.070
you made. And there may be application

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.960
logic that corresponds to what the service is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.430
providing. And there is business logic that

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.750
corresponds to the way airfares are decided, seats

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.160
are allocated, all these kinds of things.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.520
And there's a database layer that accesses the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.870
database that contains information about all the things

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.730
that the application and the business logic have

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.320
to decide on in order to satisfy a

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.470
particular request. And all these different layers have

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.780
to worry about many of the issues that

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.519
we're already familiar with, in the context of writing,

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.960
parallel programs and distributive programs, and those include

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.640
persistence for actions. For example, let's say I

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.320
made a choice, but I haven't completed the

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.850
booking. I may go away and come back later

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.305
on, in order to complete that booking. So

00:01:18.305 --> 00:01:20.790
persistence is something that I might need. You

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.920
need a notion of transaction because I have

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.530
initiated a particular operation and I have not

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.430
completed it and so transaction properties may be

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.998
needed in order to make sure that a

00:01:33.998 --> 00:01:37.660
reservation that started Is finally complete and I

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.900
have made the booking. Caching of data that you

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.420
pulled in from a database server so

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.660
that you can access the database more quickly.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.210
Clustering, which corresponds to taking a set of

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.650
related services and clustering it together in order

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.270
to improve the performance of the service. And

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.500
similarly clustering the data that you're accessing from

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.990
a data base server. All of these are issues, and of course one of the things

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.000
that we worry about a lot this days in Ecommerce is security, in particular when

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.350
we are communicating financial information, credit card information,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.990
and personal information like social security Id's and

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:26.160
so on We worry a lot about services provided by the server and that my personal

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.110
information is not compromised in any fashion. So

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.655
these are all the sets of issues that

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:34.760
N-tier Applications have to worry about in

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.090
making sure that the services it provides

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.035
are trustworthy from an end user's point of view. So, how do we structure an

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:50.440
N-tier application like this? The things that we want to reduce is reduce the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.210
amount of network communication because that results

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.960
in latency, reduce security risks for the users

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.660
which means that the business logic should

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.080
not be compromised. And increase the concurrency for

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.560
handling an individual request. For instance, there's

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.640
an individual request, but in processing this request,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.155
there's an opportunity to exploit parallelism. Often

00:03:13.155 --> 00:03:16.937
times, these are called embarrassingly parallel applications because

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:18.828
even though this request seems like a

00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:22.610
single request, there's an opportunity to exploit parallelism.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.350
And the kind of parallelism is embarrassingly parallel

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.380
because the same query. I want to find out

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.490
the availability of seats on a particular date.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.830
I don't care about which airline I go by.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.070
That's an opportunity for parallelism for the expedia

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.050
server, to go in parrallel to multiple airlines and

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.310
find out the availability of seats on the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.670
dates that I requested. Similarly, there's opportunity for exploiting

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.850
concurrency across several simultaneous requests that are coming in. And

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.480
also for clustering the computation that may have to be done on the server for

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.440
computations that are common across simultaneously

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.000
arriving requests. We want to reuse components aggressively.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.230
By components we mean portions of the application logic that can be reused

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.820
in constructing these applications as well as

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.050
in the execution of the components in

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.350
order to service the requests that are

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.880
coming in simultaneously from several different clients.
