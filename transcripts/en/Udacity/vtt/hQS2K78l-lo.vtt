00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.210
Now, something to notice about this equation we were just working with. Is that

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.790
one thing that was convenient about it was that we only had a log on one side

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.720
of the equation. Because of that, we are ready right away to use this as an

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.690
input to an exponential function. What if that wasn't the case, though? Let's

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.300
say we had something like this, 3 plus 4 lnx equals 6. We know that were going

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.100
to need to isolate natural log here, so let's go ahead and start out by doing

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.163
that. What belongs on the other side of the equation now?
