00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.540
Previously, we learned about how to represent data using different types

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.720
of graphs.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.210
When you're choosing which type of graph or chart in order to display your data,

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.760
it's not only important to think about what you're going to put in, but

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.715
also what you're going to leave out, which brings us to chartjunk.

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:21.510
Chartjunk is a term that refers to all visual elements in charts and graphs that

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
are not necessary to comprehend the information represented on the graph.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.480
Or, that distract the viewer from this information.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.720
Markings in visual elements can be called chartjunk if

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.530
they're not part of the minimum set of visuals necessary to

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.850
communicate the information understandably.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.760
Let's go through a few examples.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.550
Examples of unnecessary elements, which might be called chartjunk include

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.900
the use of heavy or dark grid lines, unnecessary text or

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.710
inappropriately complex font faces, ornamented chart axes or display frames,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.260
pictures or graphics within graphs, and the use of shading or 3D perspective.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.450
This visualization shows how chartjunk obscures the data,

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.320
which is just five simple numbers.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.320
One, two, three, four, and five.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.610
We see here ornamented chart axes which obscure the actual numbers underneath,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.810
and also the use of shading and textures on both the bars and the background.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.590
Another kind of chartjunk skews the depiction and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.050
makes it difficult to understand the real data being displayed.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.880
Examples of this type include items depicted out of scale to one another,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.500
like the monstrous teeth shown here.
