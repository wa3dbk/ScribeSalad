00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.820
If we try to navigate to local host,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.350
port 8000 with our web browser, you see that nothing's being loaded.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.742
This either means that we have not started our server yet, or

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:12.550
there is running on a different port.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.790
In our case, we haven't started the server, so let's go ahead and do that.

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.600
Switch over to your terminal application.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.930
And first check which directory you're in with the Unix present working

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.870
directory command.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.150
You can see here we're in the Udacity home

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.130
folder in the data visualization folder.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.520
So this I think's where our files are, but

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.640
let's just double check again using the LS Unix command to list the files.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.460
We can see here we have basic_charts.html, which

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.000
is the file that contains our HTML and JavaScript to display our visualization.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.220
And we also have world_cup.tsv, our

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.920
data file with information about the World Cup games.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.360
Next we need to start the web server to serve both the data file

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.120
since D3 uses AJAX to load external files and our HTML file so

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.660
that we don't run into any cross origin request issues.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.020
I'll be using Python's built in module,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.150
SimpleHTTPServer, to serve my files on local host port 8000.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.930
As you can see here, Python tells me we're serving HTTP on 0.0.0,

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.209
which is an alias for local host and port 8000.
