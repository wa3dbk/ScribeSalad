00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.104
If we're looking for the roots of this, then we need to set y equal to 0, since

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.394
the roots are the x-values that will satisfy the quadratic equation that goes

00:00:08.394 --> 00:00:12.728
along with this. Now, I could factor this, that would be one way of solving, but

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.834
I'm going to use the quadratic formula just to see what happens. So, I have

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:21.422
negative 4 plus or minus the square root of 4 squared minus 4 times 4 times 1,

00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:26.011
all over 2 times 4. Let's simplify. Now, this is starting to look pretty

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:31.184
interesting. We have 16 minus 16 under the radical sign. So, that means that

00:00:31.184 --> 00:00:36.657
we're adding 0 or subtracting 0 from negative 4. This is the only number that we

00:00:36.657 --> 00:00:41.390
can add and subtract negative 4 and get the same answer, just negative 4. This

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.942
is pretty strange, it's quite the conundrum. If x equals negative 4 over 8,

00:00:45.942 --> 00:00:50.421
that's a single answer. So, we get a final answer that the root is negative 1

00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:52.483
half, and there's only one of them.
