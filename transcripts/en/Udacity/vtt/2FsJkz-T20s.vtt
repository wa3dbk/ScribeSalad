00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.330
There are a lot of different
views on DevOps going around.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.410
So I'd like to clear up a few
things about how we're going to be

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.770
talking about it in this context.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.050
First off, doing DevOps doesn't
mean that ops is going away or

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.149
that devs are taking over
ops responsibilities.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.490
Dev and ops both have experiences and
knowledge to contribute.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.680
Neither role is being eliminated.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.140
Another thing DevOps isn't,
is just a bunch of tools.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.580
In this course,
you'll learn about several tools for

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.140
doing things like deployment and
monitoring.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.640
But using these tools is not
the same thing as doing DevOps.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.060
Here's an analogy.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.010
Google Calendar is a great tool for
helping you get to meetings on time.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.440
But putting your meetings on a calendar
doesn't make you show up on time.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.210
And it doesn't cause you to want
to show up on time, either.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.128
If you're like me, you'll want to show
up to meetings on time because you

00:00:51.128 --> 00:00:53.731
respect your coworkers and
you want to get things done with them.

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:57.275
And if you had a meeting conflict, or
show up late because you forgot about

00:00:57.275 --> 00:01:00.094
a meeting, you'd feel like you
failed to meet up to that.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:04.967
But using a calendar program is a tool
to help you accomplish a goal you

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:05.981
already had.

00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:10.070
So DevOps is kind of like
showing up to meetings on time.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.860
It's not a matter of
using particular tools,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.160
even though tools can help you do it.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.050
It's an organizational change
that's supported by those tools.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.530
But, at the same time, it would be
basically impossible to organize large

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.040
meetings without some sort of calendar.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.740
And likewise, it's not practical to
scale software deployment without

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.530
some tools to do that.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.120
The tools that you'll learn about
in this course provide support for

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.600
making big changes in how
you manage software systems.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.520
And, although, in this course you'll
be working by yourself rather than

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.020
in an actual large organization,
I hope that you'll get a sense of how

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.020
to apply these ideas and tools in your
own organization and your own projects.
