00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.863
The last thing I want to mention about this problem is what if, instead, we had

00:00:04.863 --> 00:00:09.731
x plus 2 times x? If we take our rectangle and rotate it 90 degrees we can see

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:14.930
that our factors are just along different sides. We have one factor with a side

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.613
of x plus 2 and the other factor with a side of x. Notice that we would get the

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:24.024
same total area, x squared plus 2x. Again, this is another demonstration of the

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:28.659
commutative property of multiplication. The order of the factors doesn't matter.
