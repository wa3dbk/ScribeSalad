For this last problem, we're going to learn about one more angle relationship,

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:08.931
vertical angles. Vertical angles are directly across from one another. They

00:00:08.943 --> 00:00:13.413
share a central vertex, and they form Vs. That's how we can remember them. It

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.870
turns out vertical angles are equal. So if T measures 30 degrees, M must also

00:00:17.882 --> 00:00:19.721
measure 30 degrees. Degrees.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:24.513
This also forces some unique relationships in this diagram. I'm going to see if

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:29.209
you can figure them out. If angle M measures 32 degrees, I want you to find the

00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:32.834
measures of all the other angles. Enter their measures here.
