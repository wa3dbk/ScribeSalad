00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.019
Note that with our setup, this call to an entity's update function, will allow

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:09.504
each entity's unique logic function to be called. For example, the landmine

00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:13.323
update function will check against a timer, each frame, to determine whether or

00:00:13.323 --> 00:00:17.580
not it should blow up. While self-destructive in nature, this type of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.499
functionality is the backbone of our gaming system.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.716
[SOUND]

00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:26.836
Now the game engine is capable of updating all live entities, but it's calling

00:00:26.836 --> 00:00:31.076
a blank update method on each entity class instance. We need to fill in each

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:35.290
entity's update method. But this might be a little too involved for a quiz.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.230
Let's instead, look at a single sub class of entity. The landmine disk class

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.750
represents a landmine that's been placed in the environment, waiting for an

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.235
unknowing robot to walk on top of it. We have a couple properties that make

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:51.192
this possible. First off, is the landmine disk actually defines a lifetime of

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:55.932
100 units. Secondly, is we override the kill function for the entity. To remove

00:00:55.932 --> 00:00:59.226
the physics engine body as well as the entity itself once this landmine is

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:03.126
dead. Your job, if you choose to accept it, is to fill in the rest of this

00:01:03.126 --> 00:01:06.506
update function where we subtract 0.5 from the lifetime each update call, and

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:11.899
then once we reach the bottom we call the kill function and return out.
