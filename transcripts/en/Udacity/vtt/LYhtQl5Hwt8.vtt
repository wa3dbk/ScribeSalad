00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.720
An important class of distributed memory
algorithmic primitives are the so-called

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.880
collective operations.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.360
No, not that kind of collective.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.140
One example of a collective
operation is a reduction,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.258
which in the distributed memory case,
I will call all-to-one reduce.

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:21.540
The phrase all-to-one makes it
clear that all nodes participate

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.710
to produce a final result on one node.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.450
Let's take an example.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.830
Consider this linear network
which I've numbered from 0 to 8.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.490
These ID,
numbers I'll sometimes call ranks.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.100
So, for example,
the rank of this node is 4.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.620
Now suppose each node has a single
value in its private memory,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.675
let's say these values.

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:46.460
In an all-to-one reduction,
you want to produce a final result which

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.040
is the reduction, in this case sum
of all the values on a root node.

00:00:52.408 --> 00:00:56.332
So the sum of these values
it turns out is 55, and

00:00:56.332 --> 00:01:00.363
let's say we want that
result to appear on node 0.

00:01:00.363 --> 00:01:04.080
Now intuitively, you expect a tree base
scheme like this one to work well.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.250
It's span is logarithmic
in the size of the input.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.120
In this case, there are P values.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.100
Now, this observation suggests that
you'll need to perform at least log P

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.400
communication steps.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.370
Now, initially, the data is
distributed across all nodes,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.610
so no node can do any actual work.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.120
Therefore, you'll need to
do some communication.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.280
Okay, well that's easy.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.640
Let's have all the odd number nodes send
their data to their leftmost neighbor.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.230
So 1 will send to 0,
3 will send to 2, and so on.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.850
None of these sends conflict so
all the sends can happen simultaneously.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.800
So this round of
communication will cost you

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.760
alpha + beta time since
you're only sending one word.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.060
After the communication,
the even ranks add the incoming value.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.410
The new state of the system
then looks like this.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.550
Now in this next step,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.640
you'll notice that only even
numbered ranks have values.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.740
So notice the even ranks
have partial sums.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.110
So we can repeat this scheme,
except this time with odd partners

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.370
of the remaining set sending
to the closest even partner.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.490
So we might do these sends, for example.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.967
Again, there are no
conflicts in the paths so

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:21.710
this costs us alpha + beta time.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.210
And you'll just repeat

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.314
this process until

00:02:34.314 --> 00:02:40.983
a final result remains.

00:02:40.983 --> 00:02:44.507
Now, to implement this scheme,
I want to point out a useful fact.

00:02:44.507 --> 00:02:48.910
Suppose we replace the ranks by
their equivalent binary strings.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.020
Recall that in the first round,
the odds send to the evens.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.807
Notice the odds all have a 1 in
their least significant bit, and

00:02:57.807 --> 00:02:59.500
the evens all have 0.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.268
In the next round,

00:03:00.268 --> 00:03:03.350
the only participating processes have
a 0 in their least significant bit.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.430
And notice what happens.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.000
Nodes with a 1 in their second bit

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.460
send to nodes who have
a 0 in their second bit.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.840
So again, it's basically odds to evens
where you drop off the last bit.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.320
Neat.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.200
If you've heard of
things like hypercubes,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.710
binary reflected Gray codes, or Hamming
distances, then this bit manipulation or

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.300
bitview of the world
will seem very familiar.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.770
And if you aren't, we'll give you some
pointers in the instructor's notes.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.550
Shave and a haircut, two bits.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.410
I don't know what that shave and
a haircut two bits thing is, but

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.170
I got it from somewhere.
