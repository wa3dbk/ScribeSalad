00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.730
In this case I want to keep Sarah's change of moving this code to the function.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.610
So I'll need to make my change to the function.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.290
So, I'll scroll back up to the function and change this 3 to a 2.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.810
Now I'll delete my version since I already have the change from it and

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.810
the original version since I don't need that version any more and

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.200
I'll delete git's special lines.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.630
I'll also clean up a little bit by removing these blank lines.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.720
Now I'm left with the call to the breakIntoFragments function,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.680
which breaks each asteroid into two fragments, rather than three.
