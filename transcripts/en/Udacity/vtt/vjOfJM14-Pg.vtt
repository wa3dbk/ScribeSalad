00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're going to talk about more advanced issues on random testing.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And so we're going to talk about things like test oracles.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is always a big issue when we're using random testing.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're going to talk about how random testing fits into the bigger picture--that is to say how ideally

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a random tester that you develop will sort of co-evolve with the software that is testing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They can both strengthen each other over time.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We're also going to talk about perhaps the trickiest topic of all in random testing

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is tweaking and tuning the rules and probabilities involved in making

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a random test case so that they'll actually do a good job.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so together these issues and some others that we're going to cover, constitute what I would sort of think

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
of as kind of advanced random testing issues.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What these are going to do is give you a basis for creating a really strong random test case generators.
