00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.250
Okay Michael, so if you go all
the way back to the very first slide,

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.000
when we started this conversation.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.110
The slide said something about
generalizing generalizing.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.070
But one of the words that was
written on there was scalability.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.790
So one of the things that we've been
talking about, sometimes explicitly,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.740
sometimes implicitly, is this notion
of getting scale to actually happen.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.700
So just because I think it's
important to think about scale

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.220
more than in terms of abstraction.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.622
I just want to take a moment to talk
about a algorithmic approach to getting

00:00:29.622 --> 00:00:30.688
scaling to work.

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:33.609
That's different from just doing
abstraction of the sort that

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:34.750
we've done before.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.590
Although it's going to turn out that
all the things that we've done with our

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.480
abstraction will actually work in this
new algorithmic view of scalability.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.000
That seem interesting?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah that would be really helpful.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.570
&gt;&gt; Cool let's do that, all right, so

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.160
here's a particular algorithm
that I want to introduce.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.210
It's called Monte Carlo Tree Search,
and there are four words there, and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.580
there's two different parts.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.490
So for the beginning I just want to
concentrate on the tree search part, and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.700
then tell you what I mean
by the Monte Carlo part.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.417
So, when I use this picture on the
right, the little tree, all I'm trying

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:10.028
to get you to think about with this
tree, is what we've done in the past.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:14.788
Say in an AI course, where you've
got nodes representing states.

00:01:14.788 --> 00:01:18.438
There are actions that you might take
that would get you to other states.

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:22.290
And then more actions to get other
states and so on and so forth.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.790
But this particular tree has
a nice little form that's kind of

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.580
hidden by the edges and the nodes, and
I want to harp on that for a little bit.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.680
And I think it would help if you
understand the algorithm that I'm trying

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.590
to get through on this data structure.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.130
So the algorithm is written on the left,
and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.160
it's a big loop loop
loop loop loop loop loop.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.799
And it works like this, there are four
steps, the first step is selection.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.170
And I'll define what all
these things mean in but

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.540
a moment, but I just want to go through
at a high level what each one is.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.480
So the first one is selection.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.701
And selection is basically
the way in which you're going to

00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:58.508
decide what actions to take
from a particular state.

00:01:58.508 --> 00:02:01.390
What's going to happen is you're
going to take a bunch of actions and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.738
eventually going to get to
some point in this tree here.

00:02:03.738 --> 00:02:06.624
Of possible states and
actions you might see,

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:10.400
where you don't know enough to
know how to make a selection.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.860
Once you're at a place where you don't
exactly know how you should make

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.300
a selection, the idea is that you're
going to expand the tree there.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.950
And then do simulation to figure out
what it is you ought to be doing

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.610
to make selections.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.470
And the way that's going to happen,
is you're going to estimate

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.850
from that expanded set of nodes the true
value of taking actions in those states.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.330
And then in a very kind of,
in a very Bellman equation way,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.820
you're going to back up what you
learned through your simulation.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.520
And then that will allow you
to select what to do next.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.020
And you'll just keep doing that over and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.590
over and over again making selections
where you know what to do.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.940
Expanding, simulating the world for
a little while, so

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.150
that you learn what to do, and then make
those decisions, and so on and so forth.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.670
So does that makes sense
a very high level?

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.230
See what I'm trying to accomplish here?

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.210
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think so.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.900
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; It reminds me of a lot of other

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.550
kinds of tree search that
I've seen in AI classes.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.480
&gt;&gt; Like what?

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.820
&gt;&gt; A star is a kind of tree search,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.490
a game tree search is
a kind of tree search.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.890
They have similar pictures where
you repeatedly expand nodes and

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.840
get estimates of values.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.108
&gt;&gt; Right, and in fact I like the game
trees or the games search one.

00:03:22.108 --> 00:03:25.412
This is not game search because we're
living in an MVP, and it's just us, and

00:03:25.412 --> 00:03:27.278
so we're not playing
against an opponent.

00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:30.050
But something very nice
about that particular one,

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.258
is the way it works in
that world often is.

00:03:32.258 --> 00:03:35.143
You have a particular way of
figuring out what action to take or

00:03:35.143 --> 00:03:38.208
you sort of expand and do a search
among a bunch of possibilities.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:40.597
And then eventually you run out of time,
and so

00:03:40.597 --> 00:03:44.590
you have to decide what the value is or
whatever leaf nodes you've gotten to.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.570
And the way you do that is use
something like an evaluation function,

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.040
which tells you how good
we think this node is.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.550
And that's just what you
what you've got to work on.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.250
And you use that and

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.340
you back up the values, that helps you
to make a decision about what to do.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.220
And then you make a decision,
then your opponent makes a decision,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.440
you end up in a state, and
you do it all over again.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.918
Basically you search out as far as
you have time to search out for.

00:04:06.918 --> 00:04:11.564
When you run out of time, you use some
estimate that you got from somewhere of

00:04:11.564 --> 00:04:14.478
how good the node is, and
then you back that up.

00:04:14.478 --> 00:04:16.860
And that's basically what
we're going to be doing here,

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.730
except we have another wrinkle.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.670
And the wrinkle here is where
the Monte Carlo part comes in.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.538
So the tree search is very standard.

00:04:23.538 --> 00:04:26.543
The Monte Carlo part is,
well, we've got randomness,

00:04:26.543 --> 00:04:29.307
we've got stochasticity
in our transition model.

00:04:29.307 --> 00:04:32.127
And so we're going to have to
come up with some way to do this

00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:34.298
estimation that takes that into account.

00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:36.830
And that's where the simulation
is going to come from.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.120
All right, so
let's break that up in the little parts.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.590
Actually that's a lot of words,

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.520
but I think walking through this
picture might help a little bit.
