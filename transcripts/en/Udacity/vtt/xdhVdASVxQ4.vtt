00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.404
We need to add something to this
empty Bond Villain storyboard.

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:06.338
Let's start by outlining the steps
required to set up a table and

00:00:06.338 --> 00:00:08.930
connect it to the villain
view controller.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.130
Step one, add a table to the main view.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.170
Step two, add constraints so
that the table fills the view.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.880
Step three, connect the table's data
source property to the view controller.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.040
Four, create a prototype cell and
five, set the cell's reuse identifier.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.440
Many of these steps will
be familiar to you.
