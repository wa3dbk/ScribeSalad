00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.870
In this section,
you're going to go ahead and

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.040
replace those strings in your
return statements with templates.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.990
In your templates directory, make eight
new files with the following names.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.090
Replace the previous return statements
such that they now return render

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.460
templates for each of your
methods in final project.py.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.310
But wait a second, if we design
our templates before connecting to

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.320
a database, Python will throw an error
message when we try to refer to

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.790
restaurants and menu items that
don't yet exist in our application.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.020
To get around this problem, we can
temporarily make a fake database out of

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.610
dictionaries inside of our
final-project.py file.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.910
I have made some dictionaries which
will serve as dummy variables for

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.150
one restaurant, a collection of
restaurants, one menu item, and

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.870
a collection of menu items.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.170
The source code for these dictionaries
is available in the instructor notes.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.983
Go ahead and leave hashtags in
the form action and href path,

00:00:44.983 --> 00:00:48.347
since we are focusing more on the
structure of our pages in this step, and

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.350
not so much their functionality.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.557
Now, when a user revisits
these links in a browser,

00:00:52.557 --> 00:00:54.570
they should see something like this.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.560
The functionality isn't going to be in
place just yet, but we've just created

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.070
another prototype that we can use
to present our progress thus far.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.019
Your template should also return a
different message to the user if there's

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.760
an empty menu, or empty list of
restaurants, maybe something like this.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.150
Try and see if you can accommodate for

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.060
this corner case in
your templates as well.
