00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.920
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We should multiply the equation by 3. If I multiply every term by 3, then

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.829
I'll get 9x. 3 times negative 4y is negative 12y, and 3 times negative 7 is

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:15.301
negative 21. So this equation turns into this equation, and they're actually the

00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:20.343
same equation. They just look different. And wow, look at that. We can actually

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:24.735
eliminate the y terms. I have negative 12y here and positive 12y here. Because

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.843
these terms are opposite in sign, we know that they sum to zero. I'm not going

00:00:28.843 --> 00:00:33.161
to solve this system of equations, but if you want some more practice, go for

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:37.320
it. Remember to check your answer at the end, and then you can know if you're

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.743
right.
