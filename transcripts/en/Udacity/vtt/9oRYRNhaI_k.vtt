00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.310
Just now let's look at a bunch
of different examples.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.030
Here, basically doing a comparison to
conventional aperture corrections,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.120
a conventional aperture like this
to use for doing corrections.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.184
You see a little bit of ringing,
that's shown here.

00:00:14.184 --> 00:00:18.146
You see a lot of defocusing, you can
see a little bit of ringing here also.

00:00:18.146 --> 00:00:22.024
This is the output with this aperture,
much crisper image.

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:25.429
Here's an example very similar to what
we looked at when we did the light

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.860
fieldwork of being able to de-focus,
focus an image in a single image itself.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.230
You can see basically,
interactively, we can focus one of,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.990
one of the subjects and move around and
be able to focus on the other one.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.500
Again, this is coded aperture.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.390
We used to do these
types of captioning or

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.450
hold in, information on one image
to be able to allow you to do this.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510
Refocusing from a single
image in this example.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.930
Hopefully, you can see this
on your compressed videos.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.414
Now actually, I'm going to
borrow a specific example on

00:00:53.414 --> 00:00:56.571
how these authors generated
this coded aperture.

00:01:10.827 --> 00:01:14.758
That's it, they basically did was, open
up a lens, I don't recommend doing that

00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:18.080
to your favorite high end
expensive lens by yourselves.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.080
But open it up and
put that small aperture in there, and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.380
then seal the camera back.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.230
And of course when you put the camera
the lens back on the camera

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.270
you basically have a coded aperture.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.490
Again, do this at your own peril.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.340
I don't recommend taking off and
breaking up your very,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.630
very favorite lens to
do this kind of stuff.
