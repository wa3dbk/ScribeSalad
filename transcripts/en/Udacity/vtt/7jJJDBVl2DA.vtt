00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.480
So we can install multiple instances
of the engine next application now.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.250
But can we run them?

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.480
Let's use the Docker Run command
to run the first instance

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.590
of the engine next container.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.260
Now we can use the Docker PS command
to check that it's up and running.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.640
I could run another.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.335
It doesn't even have to
be the same version.

00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:24.150
Notice this time, since we didn't have
the image array on our system for

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.691
version 1.9.3 of nginx,

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:30.525
the docker run command pulls
the image in the background first.

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:35.855
Sometimes when I'm home alone,
I'll sit in front of my computer and

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:37.695
just start up hundreds of instances.

00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:38.515
Just because I can.

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:40.753
Let's run one more.

00:00:40.753 --> 00:00:42.611
I'll stick to three today.

00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:46.925
We can see that we have all three
instances running using the P.S.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:48.474
command from earlier.

00:00:48.474 --> 00:00:53.180
You can see from the output that we have
three nginx master processes running.

00:00:54.435 --> 00:00:56.390
Docket makes this so easy.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.980
We don't have to touch nsscripts,
setup ports, or any of that stuff to run

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.660
multiple instances, or even different
versions, at the same time.
