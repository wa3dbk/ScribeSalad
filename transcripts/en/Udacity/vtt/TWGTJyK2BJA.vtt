00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.440
To understand semantic networks as a knowledge representation,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.370
let us take an example. This is an example that we saw in a previous lesson.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.800
This is A is to B as C is to D, and we have to pick one of the six choices at

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.480
the bottom that will go in D. How will we represent our knowledge of A,

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.700
B, C and the six choices at the bottom? Let us begin with A and B.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.940
We'll try to build semantics networks that can represent our knowledge of A and

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.940
B. Inside A is a circle, I'll label it x. Also inside

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.950
x is a diamond, I'll label it y. Here is a black dot, I'll label it z.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.230
We can similarly label the objects in B. So inside A are three objects, x, y,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.200
and z. So the first thing we need to do in order to build a semantic network for

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.420
representing our knowledge of A is to represent the object. So I have the object

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.110
x, the object y, the object z, standing for the circle, the diamond and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.750
the black dot. Now that we have represented the objects in A, we want to

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.900
represent the relationships between these objects. So I have the objects x, y,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.850
z, and we'll try to represent the relationship between them by having

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.490
links between the nodes representing the objects. These links can be labeled. So

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.560
I may say that y is inside x because that is the relationship in the image A.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.400
Similarly I may say that z is above y because z is above y in the image A.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:45.280
I may also say that z is above x because z is above x in image A. In this way,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.790
a semantic network representation of the image A captures both the objects and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.100
the relationship between the objects. We can do exactly the same thing for

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.940
the image B. The objects and the relationships between them,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.120
y is above x. Now that we have represented our knowledge of image A and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.000
our knowledge of image B we want to capture somehow the knowledge of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.310
the transformation from A to B because recall, A is to B as C is to D.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.920
So we want to capture the relationship between A and B. The transformation from

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.860
A to B. To do that, to capture the transformation from A to B,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.930
we'll start building links between the objects in A and the objects in B.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.560
Now, for x and y they are straightforward for z, but there is no z in b.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.840
So we'll have a dummy node here in b and we will see how we can label the link

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.200
here so that we can capture the idea that z doesn't occur in B. So we might say

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.450
that x is unchanged because x the circle here is the same as the circle here.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.260
Y on the other hand has expanded. It was a small diamond here and

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.770
it's a much bigger diamond there. Z, the black dot, has disappeared all

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.190
together, so, we have, let's say, it's deleted, it's not there at B at all.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.100
I hope you can see from this example how we constructed a semantic network for

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.870
the relationship between the images A and B. There were three parts to it.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.400
The first part dealt with the objects in A and the object in B.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.990
The second dealt with the relationships between the objects in A and

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.040
the relationship with the objects in B.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.690
The third party dealt with the relationships between the objects in A and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.045
the relationships between the objects in B. In principle, we can

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:37.090
construct semantic networks for much more complicated images, not just A and B.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.520
Here is another example of a semantic network for another set of images.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.490
Once again, we have the objects and the relationships. And then the relationship

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:48.290
between the objects in the first image and that in the second image.
