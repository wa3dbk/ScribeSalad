00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.455
So this tells us that there are actually two square roots for any number n.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.343
There's the positive version, which of course squared gives us n but there's

00:00:09.355 --> 00:00:14.442
also the negative version. Which, also 1 squared, gives us n. You will notice,

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:19.255
however, that although there's a negative sign written outside the negative

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:24.505
square root. There's not a positive sign written outside the positive version.

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:29.755
The positive version of the square root is implied to equal a positive number.

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:34.630
For example, if we wrote the square root of 64, with no sign symbol out in

00:00:34.642 --> 00:00:39.630
front, this would be implied to equal positive 8. If we wanted to show that

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:44.705
negative 8 times itself equals 64 then we'll write the square root sign at 64

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:49.590
but we'd also need to put a negative sign out in front of it. The square root of

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:54.560
a number without the negative sign in front is called the principal square root

00:00:54.572 --> 00:00:59.120
of that number. In this case, n. So, 8 is the principal square root of 64.
