00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Evans] The final major concept we're going to introduce in this unit

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is how to loop through a list.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Since loops are collections of things, it's very useful to be able to go through a list

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and do something with every element of the list.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
With the things we know so far, we already know enough to do this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
if we put them together in the right way.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You should remember the while loop from the previous unit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And as a reminder, this is the way the while loop works.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We have a while followed by a test expression,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which is something that evaluates to true or false.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And when it evaluates to a true value, that means to execute the block,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which can be a block of any number of statements we want.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And then at the end of the block we continue, go back to the while loop,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
try the test again, and we keep executing the block as long as the test evaluates to true.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So for this quiz we're going to see if you can figure out how to use while

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to go through the elements of a list.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We're going to provide most of the code for you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Our goal is to define a procedure called print<u>all</u>elements

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that takes as input a list.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We'll use the name p for the list.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Our goal is for that procedure to print out every element in the list.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I've written most of the code for this for you,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but I've left out the test expression for the while.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So the code that's written introduces a variable named i,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
initializes this value to 0, and we're going to use i to index through the elements of the list.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
For each element we print out that value, and then we increase i + 1.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So can you figure out the test expression we need for the while

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to make print<u>all</u>elements work,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and what print<u>all</u>elements should do is print out every element in the input list p.
