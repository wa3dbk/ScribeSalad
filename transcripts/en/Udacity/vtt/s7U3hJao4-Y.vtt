00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.679
So how do we implement this on the GPU? Well, it's very simple.

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.465
We're going to assign 1 thread per input element--in this case, 8 input elements.

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:12.190
For each comparison, each thread simply needs to know if it's keeping the smaller or larger value.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.580
So we're actually doing each comparison twice--once on either side of the comparison--

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.823
and the only difference is that 1 side of the comparison will keep the smaller element

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:23.230
and 1 side will keep the larger element.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.110
Now, we do need to synchronize after each comparison.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.142
So after we're done with this particular set of comparisons,

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:31.702
we synchronize and then begin the next stage

00:00:31.702 --> 00:00:34.870
and then synchronize and then begin the next stage and so on.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.449
So just a couple notes on the computation itself.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.446
One, if the input set is small enough to fit into shared memory,

00:00:41.446 --> 00:00:45.116
then a sorting network is actually a very efficient way to sort that input set.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:48.817
So in fact, many sorting algorithms that start by sorting small blocks of data,

00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:52.974
like merge sort, use a sorting network to do their sorts within a block.

00:00:52.974 --> 00:00:57.291
And it helps that a bitonic sort is probably the simplest sort to actually implement.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.684
Two, bitonic sort is not the only kind of sorting network.

00:01:00.684 --> 00:01:04.447
The odd-even merge sort is a different kind of sorting network

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:09.014
that generally runs a little faster, but it's a little more complicated to explain or program.

00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:10.787
But the basic ideas are the same.

00:01:10.787 --> 00:01:14.140
So as a quiz, what I'd like you to do is fill in each of the black boxes

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.194
with the correct numbers to make sure that these 4 input elements

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.524
are sorted by an odd-even merge sort.
