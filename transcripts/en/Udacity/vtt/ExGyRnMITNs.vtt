In order to set up our x and y axes to graph this equation right here, we need

00:00:04.086 --> 00:00:08.266
to think about how long we want each of them to be or what values you want them

00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:12.365
to extend through. Of course, we know that when we graph a set of x and y axes,

00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:16.634
we put arrows in the end to indicate that they actually extend infinitely long

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:20.844
in each direction, but I am just interested in finding out what range of values

00:00:20.856 --> 00:00:25.505
for both x and y we should display on our graph. The goal here is to pick a

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:30.225
range for x and possibly a different range for y, so that all of the values we

00:00:30.237 --> 00:00:32.689
have on our table are shown on our graph.
