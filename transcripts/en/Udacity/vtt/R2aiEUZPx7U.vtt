00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:04.342
Well, in this operation, we're copying some memory in to d_arr1.

00:00:04.342 --> 00:00:08.578
We're operating in stream1 and then the kernel is launched in stream2,

00:00:08.578 --> 00:00:11.697
so it can proceed immediately and operate on d_arr2.

00:00:11.697 --> 00:00:15.912
Both of these operations will complete in 1 second. Everything's done in 1 second.

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:18.095
And this one is a bit of a trick question.

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:21.657
Once again, we have 2 operations. They're in different streams.

00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:25.606
So it's correct to say that the final result will be completed in 1 second.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:31.249
But hopefully you noticed that we're both copying some information into d_arr1

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.372
and at the same time, because we didn't wait to launch the kernel,

00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:36.884
we're operating on d_arr1.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:38.944
We're doing something with contents of d_arr1,

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:41.897
even as it's being overwritten by the cudaMemcpyAsync.

00:00:41.897 --> 00:00:43.988
And so while it's true that we'll complete in 1 second,

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:45.682
we're going to get the wrong answer.
