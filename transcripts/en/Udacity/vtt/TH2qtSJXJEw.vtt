00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.780
Here, g of f of 1 equals negative 2, and g of f of x equals 3x squared minus 6x

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.810
plus 1. Great solving, if you got these two right. For this first problem,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.792
we'll start by finding the f of 1. We need to find the output, when the input

00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:23.749
for f is 1. So letting x equal 1 here, and here, we'll have a new expression. 1

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.635
squared equals 1, negative 2 times 1 is negaitive 2 and then we'll have

00:00:27.635 --> 00:00:33.933
positive 2 on the end. Summing these together we get a final output of positive

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:41.094
1. So, we know the output is 1 when x equals 1 for f. So, we can replace f of 1

00:00:41.094 --> 00:00:47.228
with it's value, 1. Now we just need to find the g of 1. Plugging in 1 in for x

00:00:47.228 --> 00:00:54.649
here, will get 3 times 1 minus 5, so that equals negative 2. This is how we

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.750
find g of f of 1. Now to find g of f of x we're going to take f of x this

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:07.660
entire function and we're going to plug it in for this x here. Remember f of x

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.378
is going to be the input for g. So wherever we see x for g we replace that with

00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:22.852
x squared minus two x plus 2. We distribute the positive 3 to get 3 x squared

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:29.510
minus 6x plus 6. Then we just combine the like terms on the end, to get 3x

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.710
squared minus 6x plus 1, g of f of x.
