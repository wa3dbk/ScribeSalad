The second v is data variety. For a long time,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.910
people have used databases such as SQL Server, or MySQL,

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.110
or big data warehouses from companies like Oracle and IBM

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.880
to store their data. The problem is that to store

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.260
data in systems like that, the data needs to be

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.460
able to fit in pre-defined tables. And a lot of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.780
the data that we deal with these days, tends to

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.490
be what we call unstructured or semi-structured data. So Sarah

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.740
can give us some examples of that.
