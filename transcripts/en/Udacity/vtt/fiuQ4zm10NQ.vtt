00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's my implementation of sense, the measurement model,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
as a function in the class robot.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I produce a vector called Z, which I return in the end, which has 4 bearings.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Then I go through all my landmarks, and you already have the landmarks in your code--

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
--there's 4 of them--and I use the atan2 function,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is the mathematical function for computing the angle.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It takes the y value as the first argument, and the x value as the second argument.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is the local angle of a landmark relative to the robot coordinate.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Because the robot has a global heading direction,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I need to subtract this to get my bearing value.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If I were to add noise, which is a flag over here,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
then I just produce a random noise adding variable.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is something you shouldn't have implemented,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but you need later as you implement the noise.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Of course, I make sure that the bearing is normalized between 0 and 2π.

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
I append them to the list and return it.
