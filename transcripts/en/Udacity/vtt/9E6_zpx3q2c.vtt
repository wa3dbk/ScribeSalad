00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.080
The first example I want to mention is this called duplicated

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.950
code. So what happens here what the symptom is, is that you

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.400
have the same piece of code. The same fragment of code or

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.570
code structure replicated in more than one place. And that's pretty common

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.880
when we do for example copy and paste programming. Is something

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.730
that we mention at the beginning of the lessons. So for example

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.780
we are just instead reimplementing a piece of functionality we know we

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.510
already have. We simply copy from a different part of the code.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.760
So what do you do if you have duplicated code? This can

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.100
be a problem over time because we might end up with a lot

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.480
of duplication in your system. You can use the extract method. Refactoring that

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.610
we just saw, and basically create a method that has exactly the same

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.700
function as this fragment of code and then replace the fragment of code

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.030
with an invocation to run and you will do it in all the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.520
places where the code is duplicated. That simply finds the code and favors

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.660
reuse, because there can be more

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.050
places that benefit from that additional method.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.960
Especially if it implements some popular piece of functionality. Another example

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.930
of best mal a typical one is the long method. So you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.530
have a very long method with a lot of statements. And we

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.570
know that the longer procedure, the more difficult it is to understand

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.650
it and maintain it. So what I'm going to do in this

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.690
case is to factor in such as an extract method or a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.900
decompose conditional to make the code simpler, shorten it. And extract some

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.450
of the functionality into other methods. So basically break down the method

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.180
in smaller methods that are more cohesive. Another typical example

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.380
of best mail which is something that can happen very

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.720
commonly during maintenance, is that you keep adding functionality to

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.470
a class and you end up with a large class. So

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.410
class is clearly to big. It contains too many fields

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.620
too many methods, and is just too complex to understand. This

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.990
case the obvious solution is to use the extract class

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.230
or subclass and basically break down the class in multiple classes.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.390
Each one with a more cohesive piece of functionality. So, the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.930
classes are more cohesive, are more

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.360
understandable, and the overall structure The

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.440
structure of the system is improved. Shotgun surgery is an interesting smell

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.980
and the case here is we are in a situation and you,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.270
probably will happen to you, it definitely happened to me, in

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.110
which every time you make some kind of change to the system

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.850
you have to make many little changes. All over the place to

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.280
many different classes. And this can be a symptom of the fact

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.080
that the functionality is spread among these different classes. So

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.610
there's too much coupling between the classes and too little

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.540
cohesion within the classes. Also in this case you can

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.540
use refactoring, for example by using the move method or move

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.650
field or inline class to bring the pieces of related

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.470
functionality together. So that your resulting classes are more cohesive, you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.220
reduce the dependencies between the different classes, and you address

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.305
this problem. Because at this point, each class is much more

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:34.020
self-contained and therefore it can be

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.100
modified by itself without having to affect

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.560
the rest of the system. The last smell I want to mention is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.040
one I really like, is the feature envy, and it refers to a

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
method that seems more interested In a class other than the one it

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.370
belongs to. So for example this method is using a lot of public

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.030
fields of another class, is calling a lot of methods of the other

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.830
class. And so in this case the solution is really clear. What you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.420
want to do it to perform the extract method refactoring and then the move

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.680
method refactoring so as to take the jealous

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.210
method out of the class where it doesn't

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.770
belong and get it home. To the class where it really belongs and once more the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.790
effect of this is that you decrease the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.990
coupling between the two classes and therefore you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.910
have a better system and also you eliminate

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.150
the envy. Which is always a good thing.
