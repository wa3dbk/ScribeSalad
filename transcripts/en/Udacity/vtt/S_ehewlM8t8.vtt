00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.320
Hi, we hope you're now all excited to build

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.510
scalable applications using App Engine and the Google Cloud platform.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.590
In this lesson, we'll get down to the nuts and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.840
bolts of everything, and have you deploy your first code

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.340
to App Engine. This will involve an number of

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.260
different steps, but don't worry, we'll all do it in

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.420
a structured and orderly fashion to make sure you're on

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.180
your way to become a rock star App Engine developer.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.870
So let's look at what we're going to do in

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.300
this lesson. First, we're going to look at the App Engine development

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.760
cycle and create an App Engine project where you can

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.270
upload your code. Then we're going to look at cloud endpoints that

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.820
allows you to create a backend that can work with

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.160
any frontend device technology. After that, we'll get you started with

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.740
a development environment where you develop code for App Engine. And

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.480
then, we'll introduce Conference Central, the application that we will build

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.250
out throughout this course. At the end of this lesson, you'll have a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.130
working application running in the Google Cloud.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.730
Isn't that exciting? Let's go, shall we?
