00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.640
Now we've seen two collection types,
arrays and dictionaries.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.689
When you start building apps, remember
there'll be times when arrays are better

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.150
than dictionaries and vice versa.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.780
Really understanding
their differences and

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.980
optimal use cases is a sign
of a good developer.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.780
See you in the next session.
