00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.030
The number of columns in each odd row will be two, and in each even

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.800
row will be one. This is because the width is 1,900. So if we start from

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.420
all the way on the edge, we can fit 800 plus another 800 is 1,600, but

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.720
not another 800 which would give us 2,400. So that calculation was 1900

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.250
over 800, and then we lost the decimal. In the even

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.870
row, we had to subtract 400 from 1,900, because

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.730
we can't use these first 400 meters. Then we

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.255
can fit 800, and at this point we're at

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.790
1,200, and if we add another 800, we would be

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.980
at 2,000, but that's more than 1,900, so that

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.080
wouldn't fit. So that calculation was 1,900, minus 400 over

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.880
800 and then we dropped the decimal. Let's write

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.300
an equation for this. Write it down and skip if

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.406
you know the rest. To calculate the number of columns per odd row, we calculated

00:00:56.406 --> 00:01:02.710
the width, which was 1,900 divided by the diameter, which was 800.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.070
And then dropped the decimal. To calculate the number of columns per even row,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.830
we started with the width, subtracted the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.200
radius, or 400. Divided by the diameter,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.790
and then again, tossed the decimal. Write

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.800
this down. You're going to want it for later.
