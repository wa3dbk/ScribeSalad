That may be Robbie. I'm looking for the first yellow, followed by blue, and

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:11.550
swap them. That would be bby, byy. And again, the first yellow followed by

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.080
blue, and swap them, and I'm at [BLANK_AUDIO] yyy and I'm done. Now, the

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.300
sequence is in order, all the blue ones come before all the yellow ones. So,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.940
Robbie has used this algorithm here to clean up the Legos. Now, this is a great

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.495
example, again, of an algorithm. You have a sequence of steps, each of them is

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:36.645
unambiguous, each of them is something that Robbie can do. And eventually, the

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:41.240
Legos are all cleaned up. It's actually not totally obvious why the Legos are

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.250
always cleaned up when you execute the sequence of steps, but they are. Now,

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.400
you've seen algorithms and pseudo code first with numbers, then with Lego

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.090
blocks. And now, you get to practice the Lego blocks a little bit more with

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.365
Sarah. Have fun.
