00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.920
So what I'm showing you here is sort

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.440
of a software engineering road map to synthesizing a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.590
complex system. So what we're going to do is, first

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.720
we're going to go from specification to implementation. And the

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.730
figure shows a workflow in building a complex

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.835
system. In particular, what I focused on is a

00:00:16.835 --> 00:00:21.960
TCP/IP network protocol stack using this methodology of the

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.050
design cycle that I presented. So I start with.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.670
What is called an Abstract Behavioral Spec. Now this is where we use this IoA

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.200
automata. And this abstract behavioral spec is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.210
where we describe the functionality of the subsystem

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.240
in terms of requirements. And we are

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.310
presenting the high level logical specification of the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.700
components and the specification is really talking

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.110
about the properties that we want, the subsystem

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.500
to adhere to. Not how it is going to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.660
be accomplished, or how, how it is going to be executed,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.400
but the properties that it has to adhere to.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.390
For example, in the protocol. If we desire that the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.910
package should be delivered in order, that's a property

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.610
that we want for the subsystem. Those are the behavioral

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.870
properties that are going to express using the I/O Automata. Another

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.280
behavioral specification properties that you can have are things like,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240
well, on every packet there should be an acknowledgement. That's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.860
another property that you want the protocol to have. You

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.100
can express that using the I/O Automata. So the abstract

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.480
behavioral spec is simply and lends itself to deriving properties

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.400
about the behavior of the system. Not the execution, but

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.540
the behavior of the system, such as [UNKNOWN] and so

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.290
on. It is not executable code, even though I told

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.380
you that the syntax of I/O Automata is similar to C,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.880
it's not executable code. But the interesting thing

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.770
is that Once you've expressed the abstract behavioral

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.750
properties, you can actually verify whether the behavioral

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.800
specification meets the properties that you want in

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.890
the sub-system. So proving that the behavioral spec

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.126
meets the properties is facilitated by the I/O

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:02.740
Automata theoretical framework. That's the nice thing about

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.600
this behavioral spec. Once we know that the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.880
behavioral spec is meeting the properties that we set

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.770
up for the subsystem, then we are ready to roll

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.580
our sleeves and go down the path of implementing

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.290
the behavioral properties. Next step in the process is getting

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.940
to a concrete behavioral spec. We get to this

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.830
concrete behavioral spec from the abstract behavioral spec through a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.870
whole set of refinements to this abstract behavioral spec.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.814
For instance, the refinement could be that, if I have

00:02:30.814 --> 00:02:33.466
a Q Data structure. I want first come, first

00:02:33.466 --> 00:02:36.678
serve property, how do I make sure that the abstract

00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:40.912
behavioral spec adheres to the additional execution condition that

00:02:40.912 --> 00:02:43.827
I want of first come, first serve. Those are the

00:02:43.827 --> 00:02:46.095
kinds of things that I can do, and refining

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:49.830
the abstract behavioral spec to get a concrete behavioral spec.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.810
This is still not code, but it is closer

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.270
to code than abstract behavioral spec. It's closer to implementation.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.140
And from the concrete behavioral spec, we get to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.940
the actual implementation using OCaml as the programming language.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.080
And between the implementation and the concrete behavioral spec,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.680
there is not a whole lot of difference. It

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.590
is really the scheduling of the operations that we

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.140
want in the concrete behavioral spec that is being

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.700
detailed. when we go from this step to this

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.460
step and producing OCaml code, which is finally an executable

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.320
code for the original abstract behavioral Spec

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.640
that we started with. I already mentioned

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.210
some of the reasons why they chose

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.050
OCaml as the implementation vehicle. Functional programming language,

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.020
formal semantics, and it also leads to

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.024
compact code. High level operations and data structures

00:03:40.024 --> 00:03:42.466
and also it has features like automatic

00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:47.128
garbage collection, automatic memory allocation, and marshalling and

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:50.420
unmarshalling of arguments. This is very important because

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.840
I mentioned that we're going towards Building a complex

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.670
system, from a specification, using a component based

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.430
design approach, which means that we're going to take

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.940
these components and mesh them together, just like

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.472
you take Lego blocks to build a toy. Similar

00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:09.544
to that we are taking components and meshing

00:04:09.544 --> 00:04:12.344
them together to get the complex implementation, and when

00:04:12.344 --> 00:04:15.274
we do that We are necessarily going across different

00:04:15.274 --> 00:04:18.557
components and when we go across different components you

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:21.706
have to adhere to the interface specifications of those

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:24.989
components which means you have to marshall the arguments

00:04:24.989 --> 00:04:28.071
and unmarshall the arguments when you go between these

00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:31.354
components and Ocaml Has facilities for doing these kinds

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:35.240
of marshalling and unmarshalling built into the language framework

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.022
which makes it an ideal vehicle for Component-based design.

00:04:39.022 --> 00:04:44.612
And also the programmability of Ocaml is similar to C and the definition of the

00:04:44.612 --> 00:04:50.280
primitives in OCaml makes it a good vehicle for developing verifiable code.
