00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, is this decision problem in the set NP?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, remember that we need to show two things for it to be an NP--

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it needs to have a short accepting certificate and it needs to have a fast verification algorithm.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In particular, what we don't need to do actually have a solution to this problem that's fast.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We just need to show that a certificate verification algorithm is fast.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So you should by now have a sense that the certificate in this case

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is actually pretty straightforward.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
If I tell you that there's a four clique in the graph, the way I can convince you that there's one there

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
is I give you the four nodes that make up the clique.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The verification algorithm then that you run is you go all the pairs of nodes in the certificate

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and make sure that in the original graph G, they're actually connected.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So for each one, you should have to ask the question--okay, is this pair in edge in the graph,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is this pair in edge in the graph and that each of those tests takes unit time--constant time

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and there's order Î˜ of kÂ˛ pairs to check, so this verification algorithm runs in polynomial time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So just to drive this point home now, for every graph G that has a k clique,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
there is a certificate that would cause the verification algorithm to say yes,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
but for any graph G that doesn't have a k clique, there's no certificate

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
you can give it that would cause this verification algorithm to say yes.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And just to make certain here, the verification algorithm could also check

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to see that the certificate that you gave it actually consist of k nodes.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Just to be careful.
