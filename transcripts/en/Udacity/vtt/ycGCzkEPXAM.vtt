00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.210
Now another pair of concepts.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.510
Abstraction and refinement.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.030
All design methods support these ideas.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.720
After all, we're dealing with large systems and

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.190
the only way that we can wrap our mind around those large systems is to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.080
think about them in terms of abstract concepts, and then how we're going to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.180
refine each of those abstract concepts into lower level implementations.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.770
Programming languages, design techniques typically provide some

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.780
conceptual mechanisms for dealing with abstraction.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.140
Here are a few, for example,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.590
the whole process of specification where we're dealing with the what,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.610
abstracts away all of the details of how we're going to solve the problem.

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:46.760
Programming languages is typically have various aggregation abstraction such as

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.100
arrays and structs and records and objects, that allow you to, if you wish,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.460
avoid the details of what all the features of those aggregations are.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.030
Obviously in object oriented languages, the whole idea of the class hierarchy

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.030
and generalization allows you to abstract away from all the special cases.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.860
Even a fundamental thing like the,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.140
the parameters to procedure calls are function calls.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.090
Allow you to abstract away from what all the various possible calls

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.160
to those functions are by specifying names for

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.478
the parameters rather than all of the specific arguments.

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:34.400
And finally, non-determinism, at least at the specification level,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.070
where you can avoid giving details of exactly how you're going to implement

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.230
something by specifying that you in certain circumstances, you don't care.
