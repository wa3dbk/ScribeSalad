00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.740
Congestive heart failure occurs when the
heart is no longer an effective pump.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.230
It's the single most
expensive ICD-9 code, so

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.240
there's great interest in
improving our care of it.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.700
Early on, the symptoms are subtle,
so it may not be diagnosed for

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.720
some time, even after they begin.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.810
Since earlier treatment can
forestall expensive complications,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.510
earlier diagnosis is preferable.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.750
To help with this, researches first
analyze electronic patient records,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.395
including the parts that were free text,
such as the patient reported symptoms.

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:43.740
They developed feature extraction
algorithms, as illustrated here,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.430
that use the structured and

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.120
text components to develop a set of
from 10 to 100,000 clinical features.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.460
These were classified using
both logistic regression,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.860
a statistical technique commonly used
to predict whether a patient has

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.700
a condition based on characteristics
of the patient, and random forests.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.300
Which is a method that uses multiple
methods to classify objects.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.280
This determined which features
are in fact predictive.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.280
As shown here, the resulting
model substantially outperforms

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.650
the diagnosis of CHF based solely
on the medical literature, when as

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.900
few as 50 features with high predictive
power based on the model are added.
