00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.839
In the previous lesson we mentioned the term asymptote. And in this past quiz

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.899
you saw that the graph of f of x equals 1 over 3x never actually reaches x

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:15.122
equals 0. The y axis. Now if we look at this line on the graph since its

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:20.546
already drawn for us. We can see that it splits the graph. So that the curve

00:00:20.546 --> 00:00:25.071
falls down toward negative infinity on one side. And comes back down from

00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:30.120
positive infinity on the other side. As I mentioned before, this line, x equals

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.098
0, is called a vertical asymptote, for this graph. Here's a graph of the other

00:00:35.098 --> 00:00:41.213
function we were looking at before. F of x equals 4 over X minus 1. Based on

00:00:41.213 --> 00:00:45.962
this graph, what do you think the vertical asymptote for this function is? Make

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:50.047
sure that what you write is the equation for a vertical line. Since that's what

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:51.480
a vertical asymptote is.
