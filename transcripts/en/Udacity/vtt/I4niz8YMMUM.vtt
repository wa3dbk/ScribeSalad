00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.190
One key paradigm in D3 that we haven't explicitly covered,

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.190
since dimple js abstracted it away from us, and

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.250
in all the coding we did in lesson one, we didn't have any bound data,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.010
is the anonymous function as a call back, to access an element's bound data.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.270
It's an anonymous function, because it's not given a name.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.840
And if you come from other languages like to Python,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.010
it's very similar to the lambda.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.180
And I call it an accessor function because it allows us to

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.830
change the behavior of a generic D3 function.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.930
Here I'm working with the extent to act differently depending on what we return.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.900
So again this anonymous function is accessing the attendance in our data.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.720
So pulling out the bound attendance values.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.350
And since we're returning them.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.330
The extent happens across the attendance column and returns the minimum and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.220
maximum values.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.810
Again in this case we're using the same d3.extent, we're passing the same data.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.050
And hopefully you were wondering previously how do we get a time extent and

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.790
the count extent from very similar code?

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.800
Well the answer is the anonymous accessor function.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.020
For the time we return the date and for

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.320
the attendance or count extent we simply return the attendance.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.830
And while this function's quite simple in both these cases.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.220
You can perform all sorts of complicated logic within.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.640
And this is exactly how d3 makes its charts data driven.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.610
The data bind, or .data function is only one side of the coin.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.650
The other side is the anonymous accessor function, because after all.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.050
What good is bound data, if there's no way for us to access and use it?
