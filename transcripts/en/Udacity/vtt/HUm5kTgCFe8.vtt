00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.500
Let's roll back time a little bit.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.150
Let's go back to where we had
$10,000 in our account and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.970
we owed Joe 100 shares of stock.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.780
What can go wrong?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.840
What if, instead of going down,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.870
IBM went up to $150 per share, and
now you want to exit your position?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.810
Well, again, you go to Lisa and
say, hey, Lisa,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.950
do you want to sell me your shares?

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.180
She says no.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.200
Well, Nate is still out there,
he's willing to sell.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.658
So again, you buy those shares from
Nate then you return them to Joe.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:40.120
But this time it costs you $15,000
because the price has gone up.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.270
And remember,
you've got only $10,000 in your account.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.784
So the net result after all this is
said and done is that you're out $5,000.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:54.809
So if you bet wrong when you short
a stock and the price goes up,

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.689
you lose money, and
it can be significant.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.720
So to recap,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.489
we've gone through many of the different
aspects of the mechanics of the market.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.270
We've shown you how hedge
funds exploit the market.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330
We've shown you different order types.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.670
And we've shown you especially
the details of short selling.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.590
I'll see you at the next lesson.
