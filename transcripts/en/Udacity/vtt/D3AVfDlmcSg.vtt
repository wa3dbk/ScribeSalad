00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.880
There's a key technique in my solution that's very useful in computer graphics.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.278
You could compute both the top and bottom locations in the loop for capsules.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:10.978
However, a better method is to initially compute the bottom location, and then

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:14.454
on each iteration compute only the top position. At the end of the loop, you

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:18.395
then set this top position into the bottom. Now, bottom is set for the next loop

00:00:18.395 --> 00:00:22.188
iteration. The only other clever bit of code here is the realization that the

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.960
bottom sphere needs to be on for only the first capsule in a string. After that,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.718
I set open bottom to true, so that it's never output again for this helix. If

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:33.338
you want to take this exercise to the next level. Rewrite the code so that the

00:00:33.338 --> 00:00:36.962
cylinder and sphere geometry is reused throughout the helix. Right now, no

00:00:36.962 --> 00:00:40.420
instancing is done, so it's a memory hog. Every capsule creates its own

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.472
geometry. Another extension is to allow the art parameter to be a floating point

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:47.920
number so you can generate just part of the arc. If you really want to play

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.760
around try factors to have the helix become a larger and larger spiral or have

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.465
the radius vary with height as a sign curve. Me, I find once I start playing

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:59.139
with procedural modeling that it's hard to stop. If you make something great

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:02.737
consider submitting it into the 3JS library itself for inclusion as a demo. You

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:06.385
can use get hub to make submissions, see the additional course materials for

00:01:06.385 --> 00:01:07.373
