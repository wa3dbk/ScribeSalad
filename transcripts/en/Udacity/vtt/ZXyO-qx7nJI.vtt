00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.800
Now let me conclude the lesson by summarizing a few important

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.840
aspects of white-box testing. The first important aspect is that white-box

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.770
testing works on a formal model. The code itself are models

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.430
derived from the code. So when we do white-box testing, we

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.160
don't need to make subjective decision, for example, on the level

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.890
of obstruction of our models. Normally, we simply represent what's there.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.010
And so what we will obtain are objective, results and objective

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.400
measures. As I also said at the beginning, coverage criteria allows

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.790
us to compare different test suites, different sets of tests,

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.780
because I can measure the coverage achieved by one test suite

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.280
and by the other, and then decide which one to use

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.400
based on this measure. And again, remember, these measures aren't perfect,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.700
but they at least give you an objective number, an objective

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.470
measure of the likely effectiveness of your tests. So even though

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.130
achieving 100% coverage does not mean that you identify all the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.710
problems in the code for sure. If your level of coverage

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.700
is 10%, for example, for stemen coverage. That means that

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.360
you haven't exercised 90% of your code, and therefore the trouble

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.565
is in a piece of software that is inadequately tested

00:01:00.565 --> 00:01:03.600
and likely to be of inadequate quality. We also saw that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.370
there are two broad classes of coverage criteria, practical criteria

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.430
that we can actually use, and theoretical criteria that are interesting

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.410
from a conceptual standpoint, but that they are totally impractical.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.170
They are too expensive to be used on real world software.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.350
And finally, as we also said at the beginning,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.820
one of the great things about white box testing and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.910
coverage criteria, is that they are fully automatable. There are

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.380
tools that can take your code, instrument it automatically. And

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.050
when you run your test cases, they will tell

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.330
you, what is the level of coverage that you achieve

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.410
with your test at no cost for you. So there's

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.763
really no reason not to measure coverage of your code.
