00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is reject, and you can see it easily from the data shown here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
79.74 is the mean. This is the 95% confidence interval--less than a kilogram.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The reason why it's so small is because we have so many data samples, really interesting.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As a result, we don't even come close to 73.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, if all the guesses that you guys voiced online were actual measurements

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
using the actual scale of Sebastian,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and this is what I told you and the question really was H0.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Is Sebastian telling the truth or is he lying?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The, using statistical techniques, you should conclude he's lying.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is somewhat contrived. This is the only data point, and everything else is just guesses.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
But I hope you had fun using actual data that you students derived in answering this question.
