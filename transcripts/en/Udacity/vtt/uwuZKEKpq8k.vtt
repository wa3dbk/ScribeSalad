00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.220
In addition to AI problems having several characteristics,

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.740
AI agents too have several properties. Property number one. AI agents,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.170
have only a limited computing power, processing speed, memory size, and

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.890
so on. Property number two. AI agents have limited sensors,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.060
they cannot perceive everything in the world. Property number three.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.220
AI agents have limited attention, they cannot focus on everything at the same

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.100
time. Property number four. Computational logic is fundamentally deductive.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.090
Property number five. The world is large, but AI agents' knowledge of the world

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.150
is incomplete relative to the world. So, the question then becomes, how can AI

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.800
agents with such bounded rationality address open-ended problems in the world?
