00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.980
Hello. Welcome to the lesson on How to Solve Problems. Solving problems is one

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.254
of the most important skills you can learn. And calling it skill is really an

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:11.920
understatement. Nearly everything you can do can be viewed as solving problems.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.334
And improving as a problem solver is a lifelong challenge. One short lesson is

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:19.296
not going to be enough to make anyone an expert problem solver. But for this

00:00:19.296 --> 00:00:21.936
lesson, we're going to, to look at some aspects of how to approach more

00:00:21.936 --> 00:00:25.687
complicated programming problems. And hopefully, that will help you in solving

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:29.561
any problem that you're faced with from now on. But it doesn't really make sense

00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:33.177
to talk about solving problems without thinking about particular problems. So,

00:00:33.177 --> 00:00:36.622
we're going to look at a specific practice problem and talk about how I would go

00:00:36.622 --> 00:00:40.314
about solving that. And our goal by looking at a particular problem is not just

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:44.142
to solve that particular problem, but to draw some general lessons about how we

00:00:44.142 --> 00:00:46.453
can get better as problem solvers in general.
