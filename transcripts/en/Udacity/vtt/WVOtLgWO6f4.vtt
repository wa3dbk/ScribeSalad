00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.496
So we know that we need to move this parabola up in order to make it fit our

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:09.208
real world situation, but by how much do we need to move it up? If I'd like to

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.933
have one of the roots of our parabola after we've moved it upward, equal to 0,

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.871
then by how much do we need to translate this parabola upward?
