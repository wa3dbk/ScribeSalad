00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.816
Let's get started with implementing the missing methods in the subclass. We'll

00:00:04.816 --> 00:00:08.521
start with the addChoice method in the display method I've given you a stop gap

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:13.549
implementation we'll refine that later. In the addChoice method we need to add

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.789
the new choice one of the multiple choices somewhere where as some where. We

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.689
actually also need to have an instance variable to collect the choices, we'll

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.843
just collect them in an ArrayList of strings. One entry per choice that means

00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:31.803
you needed to clear that instance variable in the choice question class and you

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:37.617
also need to initialize the instance variable in the constructor. Once you've

00:00:37.617 --> 00:00:41.457
done those things you can turn back to the addChoice method and simply add the

00:00:41.457 --> 00:00:45.648
choice. There's the second parameter that indicates whether the choice is

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:49.816
correct or not. We'll take that one up in just a minute. At this stage, just

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:53.103
leave it alone. So go ahead and do those three things and then we'll compare

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:53.950
notes.
