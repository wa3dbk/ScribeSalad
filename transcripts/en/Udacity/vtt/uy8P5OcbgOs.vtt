00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.470
The fifth major category of issues is heterogeneity.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.020
We started with the assumption, we have a heterogeneous distributed system,

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.870
but the dimensions of heterogeneity are many. Hardware, this

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.880
not just what kind of computers, but also are there embedded devices involved.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.890
Are there cellphones involved in this? Are there card readers involved?

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.600
Are there other, other devices? Different operating systems.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.775
Different programming languages. All of the different standards protocols and

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:37.510
API's that might be involved in building this application. The pieces of

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.620
the application that provide access such as a web browsers or these devices.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.670
All of these can change. More over even if they don't change.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.075
Even if they're uniformly applied. That is every part of the system uses

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:58.460
Linux or every part of the system uses Ruby. Are they using the same version?

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.330
For example, imagine the issue of testing a web

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.810
based application across browser versions. You have three or

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.960
four main families of browsers, each coming in three or four different versions.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.080
Also the problem of testing becomes that much more challenging.
