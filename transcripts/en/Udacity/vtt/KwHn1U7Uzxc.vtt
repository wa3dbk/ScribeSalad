00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.200
So here's the palette that Nick created
running in an actual Android app.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.470
The first thing I did was
create a colors.xml file

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.610
containing the colors
that I wanted to specify.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.325
For the names, I used what was listed
in the material design guidelines, so

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:22.990
indigo_300, indigo_500,
700, and pink_a200.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.870
And the use the hexadecimal value for
those colors.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.470
In the style for the app, I used those
identifiers, prefixed by @color,

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.710
and a slash for my color primary,
primary dark, and the accent color.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.200
This makes it whole
lot more readable and

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.810
you only have to change colors in
one place, your colors.xml file.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.790
In the xml for

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.800
our view, we can specify those
identifiers in a couple different ways.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.090
So we can see here, we set our app
bar layout, that's the container

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.790
that holds our app bar, to have
a background with the primary color.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.570
Now the reason we have
this question mark here

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.920
is that colorPrimary refers
to a theme local attribute.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.000
We could have also listed
?attr/colorPrimary.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.370
So if we look at
the floating action button

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.120
you might notice that there isn't any
designation of color information here.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.840
That's because behind the scenes,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.350
it assigns the color accent
value if you specified it.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.440
So check out this link, which is also
specified in the instructors notes,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.830
to see what other attributes you can
change and customize in material design.
