00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.202
Our domain goes from 4 to 7, not including either 4 or 7. In other words, x can

00:00:05.202 --> 00:00:10.385
take on any value between 4 and 7. Remember, when we're looking for a domain on

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:15.745
our graph, the only thing we're considering is x coordinates, for which there is

00:00:15.745 --> 00:00:19.079
a point on the function. The y values here don't matter at all.
