00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.435
Fortunately, there is a better way. We are

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:08.100
going to use a technology called templates. Templates generally refer

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.604
to a library. As a template library is a

00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:13.600
library to build complicated strings. And by strings I

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.383
really mean any string. But when you're developing web

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:19.971
applications, most of the time, we're referring to HTML,

00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:22.938
because those are the strings [UNKNOWN] generate the vast

00:00:22.938 --> 00:00:25.900
majority of the time. And in this lesson, and

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.810
really for the rest of this class, I'm going to be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.144
using a template library called Jinja 2. The reason we're using

00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:34.916
this is because it's built in to Google App Engine

00:00:34.916 --> 00:00:39.272
and, you know, there're many templating libraries, and they're all very

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:42.704
very similar and Jinja2, while this course is the first

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:45.740
time I've been exposed to it. Was very easy to learn

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.400
for me because it is very similar to other template

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.010
libraries that I've used, so it should be very similar to

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.390
other template libraries that you will probably find yourself

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.830
using, down the road. You can find more information about

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.870
Jinja at jinja.pocoo.org. P-O-C-O-O.org. Let's start integrating this into the

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.780
little toy app we've been building and see how things

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.360
look. Okay, the first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.040
update our app. [UNKNOWN] this is an app engine thing.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.210
If you want to include external libraries, you need to do

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.300
this. You got a libraries line, you have the library

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.800
name, and you say which version to use. You don't need to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.740
fully understand this right now and to be honest, I don't fully

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.900
understand this right now. You can find more information in the App

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.250
Engine docs, if you want to start including more libraries. Next what we

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.990
do is we add an import statement to import Jinja. At this

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.790
point I'm going to reload our web app just to make sure this

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.310
import statement worked, which basically implies

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.110
that the apps, the app.yaml update

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.330
worked as well. So I get to this page, and I hit reload,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.630
and it looks like it worked. If there was an error, you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.690
know, let's say I type this incorrectly, you know, adding an extra 2,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.990
this is something you might see when you're doing this on your own,

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.750
and I reload this page, you'll get you know, you'll see blank or

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.530
nothing. And then if I look at my terminal, we can see

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.788
an error in my terminal, no module name jinja22. So, if you see

00:01:58.788 --> 00:02:02.505
this, you know, make sure you updated your [UNKNOWN] properly and make sure

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:06.390
you typed the, the module name properly. Okay, let's get rid of that.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.820
I'm going to add a couple lines to initialize Jinja. These two

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.700
lines are basically where you're using the OS library, which is built

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.700
into Python. os.path.join, this concatenates two file names. And I'm, so

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.150
I'm concatenating, this is basically the directory that my current file is

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.670
in. And then I'm adding the word templates to this. If

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.250
we were to run this in the python terminal, it would look

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.670
something like this. So here I'm in the python terminal. I just

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.770
want to, I just want you to see what's going on here because

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.390
this is very simple, but if you've never done it before,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.478
it can be a little confusing. And you may as well just

00:02:36.478 --> 00:02:39.980
understand everything that's going on. So if I were to say os.path.join

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.050
and run it with a string like home and a, and a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.230
string like Steve, it just [UNKNOWN] the two together, gets the slashes

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.490
right. You know you could just say plus, but it just makes

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.630
sure that everything adds up. So that's os.path.join. This, this other part

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.880
the os.path dirname, returns the directory of the current file. That's actually

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.650
not going to work in the terminal, because underscore

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.180
underscore file doesn't exist. But it exists when

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.770
you're running a program. So this is just

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.270
basically says, my template directory will be the current

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.950
directory I'm in, slash templates. Okay, next we

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.440
instantiate what we're going to call the Jinja environment, jinja_env.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.500
And, basically, this is a new jinja environment,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.750
and, we're going to use a FileSystemLoader using our template_dir

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.850
which we just defined there. And this basically says,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.840
when we render templates Jinja's going to look for those

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.260
templates in this directory. Current directory slash template. Nothing

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
too complicated there, and you can just copy these lines.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.570
Next, I'm going to add a couple of functions to

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.900
my handler class here. I added two functions. Render

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.880
str and render. So the first function here is

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.130
called render str. And this basically takes a file name,

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.890
and a bunch of extra parameters. This is the python syntax

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.470
for, basically, extra parameters. And we use that Jinja environment that

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.390
we created earlier above, and we call it get template and

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.960
give it a file name. This basically causes Jinja to load that

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.700
file and create a Jinja template. We store it in t,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.730
and we call t.render passing in the parameters that were passed

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.860
into this function. This'll be more clear when we actually use

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.700
this as an example. And this just returns a string. And then

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.960
I added this other render function, which I'll use all over

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.440
the place, which again takes a template, a bunch of extra

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.850
parameters and it just cause render stir this other function, but

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.845
it also wraps itself in self.write. Which is the one that

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:29.505
actually sends it back to the browser. You'll actually see these

00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:33.030
3 functions in most of the examples, most of the homework

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.050
solutions and stuff I use in this class. I've just been

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.990
copying them around. And in fact what's funny is actually just interviewed

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.250
a guy at Hipmunk, who had these three functions in his

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.030
code. And I had asked him. I was, like, where did

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.810
you get those, those functions from? And he, he couldn't remember.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.060
I was like, Yeah, it's from this [UNKNOWN] course I taught

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.500
a little while ago. [LAUGH] So, anyway, yeah these are handy

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.490
little things. Feel free to copy them around. It's just for

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.650
rendering basic templates. And next one I'm going to do is

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.190
move some of this HTML out of HTML and into a file.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.230
So let's create a new file, and copy, and

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.340
let's copy this code, or this HTML into that

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.390
file. Let's get rid of this percent s for

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.732
now. I'm going to save this file, I'm going to call it

00:05:16.732 --> 00:05:19.387
shopping list.html, and I'm going to store it in this

00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:23.106
template structure that I just created. Okay. Now as you

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:26.656
can see, sense we're using this editor sublime, and

00:05:26.656 --> 00:05:29.235
it knows it's HTML. It actually just started Syntax highlighting

00:05:29.235 --> 00:05:31.240
things for us. And we can also clean up our

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.480
indentation here without too much drama, so it looks a little

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.154
bit better. You notice I still don't have any of the

00:05:38.154 --> 00:05:41.700
HTML scaffolding around this. You know, the head and the body

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.700
and the, the actual HTML tech. That's because it's not really

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.260
needed for this example, and we'll add it in later. It's

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.030
generally good form to do so, but, there's no reason to

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.070
make you guys watch me type that over and over again.
