00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Close to the surface of the earth, every object

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
experiences an acceleration of 9.81 m/s².

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is independent of that mass of the object because

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
assume that you have two objects of the same mass.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Each one is accelerated at the same rate.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So they stay on the same height as they fall,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which means you can combine these two objects, add a little glue.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and this larger object is going to fall,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but the same acceleration.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But now it has twice the mass.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Based on this, you should be

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
able to answer the following question.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What's the gravitational force of a mass on 1 kg --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
0.1 N, 1 N, 10 N or even 100 N?
