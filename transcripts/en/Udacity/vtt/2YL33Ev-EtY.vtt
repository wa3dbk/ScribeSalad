00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.610
Let's look at the solution to our disk access time quiz. We can ignore queuing,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.000
so our read of a randomly chosen byte begins by seeking there.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.020
The head assembly is at one end of the disk. A randomly chosen

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.012
byte will be at the cylinder where we are, or 999 cylinders

00:00:21.012 --> 00:00:25.573
away, or anywhere in between with equal probability.

00:00:25.573 --> 00:00:32.070
So on average, we will be seeking 500 cylinders away, times 10 microseconds per

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.772
cylinder. So our seek will take us five milliseconds. At that point, our head

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:44.587
is in a random place on the correct track. Now we need to wait for the

00:00:44.587 --> 00:00:50.582
beginning of the correct sector to get under the head. And just like

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:55.622
when we were doing the seek, the rotational latency will

00:00:55.622 --> 00:01:00.710
be on average, half of a rotation. Sometimes we will be lucky

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.723
and land just at the very beginning of the sector we want. Sometimes we

00:01:05.723 --> 00:01:09.043
will be unlucky and land just past the beginning

00:01:09.043 --> 00:01:11.359
of the sector we want. So, we will not

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:13.303
be able to read that sector, even though we

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:15.759
are technically right above the data we want to read.

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:19.297
We will have to wait for the beginning of the sector to get back which is

00:01:19.297 --> 00:01:22.880
a whole rotation. So, on average, we will

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.170
be having half a rotation. Each rotation is

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.210
a hundredth of a second or 10 milliseconds.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.090
So we end up adding another five milliseconds

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.780
to our read time. Next, we need to

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.700
read our sector. There are ten sectors per track.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.688
So the read will take 1 10th of a

00:01:43.688 --> 00:01:48.019
rotation, which will be one millisecond because we already determined

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:52.345
that a rotation will be ten milliseconds. So in total,

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:57.530
it will take 11 milliseconds to complete a disk access.
