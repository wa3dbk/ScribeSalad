Great, so we know how to define classes and create instances. We don't know how

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.780
to do anything useful with them yet, so that's what we're going to learn next.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.970
We're going to learn about attributes. If we want to do something more

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.412
interesting with our classes, we need to add attributes to them. And in Python,

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:17.269
we can do that very simply. We can use the object, followed by a dot, followed

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.914
by a name. This is the name of the attribute. And if we want to create a new

00:00:20.914 --> 00:00:24.626
attribute, or update an old one, we can use assignment so we can assign that to

00:00:24.626 --> 00:00:29.202
some value. What this does is it sets the value associated with the attribute

00:00:29.202 --> 00:00:34.082
name, for the object here, to be whatever this expression evaluates to. So, let

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:38.732
me show you an example. So here, we've created an instance of the Restaurant

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:43.360
class. It has no attributes yet, but we can add one. Using the syntax, we're

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.824
adding an attribute name and giving it the value of the string, McDowell's

00:00:47.824 --> 00:00:54.299
Burger Emporium. And now, we can use that attribute. Note that adding an

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:59.500
attribute doesn't create a new object, it just adds attributes to that object.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.070
So, we already had our Restaurant object. That was created when we did this. We

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.886
had a new instance of it, and we labeled it McDowell's. Now, we've taken that

00:01:07.886 --> 00:01:11.240
object and we've added an attribute name to it, and we've given it some value.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.388
Notice that if we create a new Restaurant instance, this is creating a new

00:01:15.388 --> 00:01:20.284
object and we're assigning it to the name chez_bananas. So, the chez_bananas

00:01:20.284 --> 00:01:25.736
object does not have a name attribute. If we try to look for it, we'll get an

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:30.010
error. We get an AttributeError that says, this Restaurant object has no

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.752
attribute name, name. We can add one. Now, we've added a name attribute to Chez

00:01:37.752 --> 00:01:46.230
Bananas, add this long string. That didn't change the name of McDowell's.

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:50.356
They're separate objects with separate names. We can of course add other

00:01:50.356 --> 00:01:56.451
attributes, so we can add say, an owner. Add another attribute, and we will also

00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:01.105
add a chef attributes. These didn't change anything about the object that Chez

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:06.504
Bananas points to. Just to confirm, Chez Bananas still has no chef. Just like

00:02:06.504 --> 00:02:10.347
any other name, we can change what a name refers to, so we can change what an

00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:15.408
attribute refers to. We'll do that just within assignment. So, suppose Chef

00:02:15.408 --> 00:02:20.631
Quesy was fired. We have a new chef at McDowell's, we have Chef Hurl. And

00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:25.140
that'll change the value associated with this name. Now, the chef attribute

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.238
points to the string, Chef Hurl. Sounds very yummy to me. We can define

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:36.829
functions that work on our objects. Let's define a display_restaurant function,

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.380
and it's going to take a restaurant as input, and all it will do is print the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.571
name of the restaurant. So, let's try that. We'll call the display restaurant

00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:51.229
passing in the object McDowell's refers to, which has the name McDowell's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:56.702
something or other. We can do the same thing with the object Chez Bananas refers

00:02:56.702 --> 00:02:57.013
to.
