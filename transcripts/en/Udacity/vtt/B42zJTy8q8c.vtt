00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.280
Before PHRs and sites like Patients
Like Me, hospitals and physicians

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.430
were able to establish portals,
essentially web pages where their

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.340
patients could do some of the things we
discussed under personal health records.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.129
The first of these is now
part of Relay Health,

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.740
itself a part of McKesson Technology
Solutions For Healthcare.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.980
Here patients can get test results,
they can request or

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.990
sometimes even make appointments,
and they can pay their provider,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.050
something you don't see on PHR sites,
which emphasizes the key difference.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.400
Portals are generally
provided to the patient,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.580
while PHRs are generally
patient initiated and operated.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.400
Importantly as you can see here,
patients can now Download their

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.240
Health Data, in this case using
Blue Button Plus, a technology we've not

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.250
previously mentioned,
that is intended for just this purpose.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.000
And one that is getting a lot
of attention because of the VDT

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.745
requirements of Meaningful Use 2.
