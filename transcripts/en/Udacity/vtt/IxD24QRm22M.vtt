00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.630
What answer did you think about, David?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.360
&gt;&gt; So this is a tiny bit different
than the one we saw earlier.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.130
Earlier, we saw this exercise
without the square as an option, so

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.940
we were forced to pick the triangle.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.930
But here, since we actually have the
square as the option, I think the easier

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.079
transformation is to say that
the middle shape is disappearing.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.120
Thus, the triangle disappears and
leaves us with just that square.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.950
So, I'd say that five
is the correct answer.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.270
&gt;&gt; That's a good answer, David,

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.800
but note that three could also be
an answer because one could imagine

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.910
the relationship between A and
B a little differently.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.560
Suppose we were to say that
the outer circle is disappearing and

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.650
the inner circle is expanding.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.650
In that case, we will again get B.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.540
So in that case, we might say that
the outer image is disappearing,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.320
this square, and the inner shape
is expanding to give us three.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.280
So three is also a legitimate answer.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.130
&gt;&gt; So I imagine though,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.560
that most people would choose
answer five over answer three.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.760
But why would most of us choose
answer five over answer three?

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.930
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.540
Let's look at this in more detail.
