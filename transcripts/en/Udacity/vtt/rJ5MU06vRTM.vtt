Finally, be sure to test
your localized app.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.380
Keep in mind that devices vary across
locales, so try to have test devices

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.910
that closely match what is available
in your target environment.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.480
Check all of your target locales for
common issues, such as clipped text, or

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.310
awkward line wrapping, or untranslated
text and incorrect alphabetization.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.750
And then, check a locale you aren't
supporting to be sure that your default

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.220
resources are working as expected.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.150
Finally, have your app
reviewed by native speakers,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.000
either within your company or
through beta test programs.
