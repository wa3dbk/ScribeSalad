00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.170
In the previous lesson, we talked about object-oriented analysis, the process by

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.790
which you can begin to come to understand the problem you're trying to solve.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.530
Today, we're going to talk about how would you express the results of

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.770
that understanding using the Unified Modeling Language, UML. In particular,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.110
we're going to talk about UML's Class Model Diagram, which is the most popular

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.960
form of UML. Besides being popular, it's also the most complex

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.070
of the diagramming types in UML. However, there's no need for you to use all of

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.550
its features, particularly at the start of the modeling process.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.150
There's nothing wrong with having an abstract version that you refine over time.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.259
Nevertheless, I'd like to introduce you to all of the features, so

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:53.370
that when you need them you're aware that they're there. UML class diagrams

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.745
are also sometimes called Static Structure Diagrams. They're one of UML's

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:03.770
structure diagrams as opposed to the diagrams which you used to model behavior.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.040
Despite being called Class Model Diagrams, besides classes, they also have

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.340
iconic representations for interfaces, objects, relationships, and so on.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.600
The official specification for UML can be found on the Class Resources page.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.620
And we're also going to be taking some examples from the UML reference manual,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.690
which is referred to on the resources page as well.
