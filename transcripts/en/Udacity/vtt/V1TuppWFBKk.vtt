00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Consider this histogram displaying counts of numbers from 1 through 11.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Note that each bar is centered at the value listed,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
so you can assume that that's the average of the values in the bar.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So you can interpret this to mean there are 3 points with a value of 3,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
2 with a value of 4, 1 with a value of 6, 1 with a value of 5, and so on.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What I'd like you to tell me is where the mean, median, and the mode are in this data.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
There's only 1 right answer for each.

00:00:36.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check the circle for each of mean, median, and mode.
