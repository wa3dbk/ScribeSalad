00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
And finally,

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.830
we reach the intersection of two very
important topics, maps and hashing.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.400
Hash maps are one of the main places
you'll see hash function show up.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.160
In the previous example we were
just using a hash function

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.650
to find a place to store keys.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.180
However, maps have keys and values.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.130
You can use the keys as inputs to a hash
function, then store the key value pair

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.490
in the bucket of the hash value
produced by the function.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.400
Again since you know the keys in a map
are unique since they belong to a set

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.370
you could use a hash function to give
them each their own unique buckets.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.700
You can also design a hash
function to allow for collisions.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.820
In an interview, you'll often be asked
to create a hash table to show that you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.430
understand hashing.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.600
Also that you know the upsides and
downsides of designing a hash function.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.170
However hash maps are very useful
to integrate into algorithms.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.700
Constant time lookups can
really speed up your code.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.910
Keep it in mind and

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.559
always think if it'll work first when
thinking through data structures.
