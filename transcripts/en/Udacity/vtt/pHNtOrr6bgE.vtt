00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.825
So we're looking for the proportion between 118 and 226. And using this same

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:13.910
logic as before, we know 68 % is here, within one standard deviation, and 13.5 %

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:21.248
is here. Just between these two standard deviations. So the proportion is 0.815.

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:28.332
Sorry if I keep bouncing around between proportions and percentages. I just find

00:00:28.332 --> 00:00:32.252
it easier to explain using percentages, but I'd like you to put your

00:00:32.252 --> 00:00:36.942
calculations in terms of proportions because that's generally the way in which

00:00:36.942 --> 00:00:41.422
we write probabilities and also later in this lesson we are going to use a tool

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:46.021
that only uses proportions. So, that's why I am asking you to calculate it in

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:47.410
terms of proportions.
