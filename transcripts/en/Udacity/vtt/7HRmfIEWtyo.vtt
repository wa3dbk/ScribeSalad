00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.535
Now, even though there are limits to what IQ tests can tell you, they're widely

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:08.455
used and can be pretty useful especially for educators. The popularity of IQ

00:00:08.455 --> 00:00:13.860
tests have been able to give us extensive knowledge of the range of IQ scores.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.924
Let's look at what IQ scores look like for the entire population. IQ scores are

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:23.124
converted to have a mean of 100. Now the standard variation around the mean is

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:28.670
15 points. This standard variation is called the standard deviation. This show

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.465
how much the score varies from the mean. So, the mean would be 0 because

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:38.268
there's no difference. 15 points one way would be one standard deviation. Two

00:00:38.268 --> 00:00:42.445
standard deviations and three standard deviations. Same with the other way. One

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.370
standard deviation from the mean, two standard deviations from the mean, and

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.117
three standard deviations from the mean. 68% of the population is within one

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:56.338
standard deviation from the mean. So 68% of the population has an IQ score

00:00:56.338 --> 00:01:03.188
between 85 and a 115. Now, 95% of the population is within two standard

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:10.346
deviations from the mean. So 95% of the people you know score between 70 and a

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:16.174
130 on an IQ test, and 99.7% of the population scores within three standard

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:26.775
deviations of the mean. So between 55 and 145. Now, as you can see, with 99.7%

00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:31.875
of the population scoring within three standard deviations in either direction

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:36.450
of the mean, that doesn't leave a lot of room for people to score above a 145

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.730
or below a 55. It's only about 15 out of 1,000 people score higher or lower

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.162
than either one of these two extremes. We also did an example like this in

00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:52.650
lesson two, the research methods lesson. You should go back and check it out if

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.194
this is a little confusing. Now traditionally, those who have extreme IQ scores

00:01:57.194 --> 00:02:02.588
are given labels. Such as a genius who scores above 140 on an IQ test because

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:09.050
not a lot of the population scores that high. Or intellectually disabled, those

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.884
who score less than 70 on the IQ test because again, not a lot of the

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:16.199
population score that low.
