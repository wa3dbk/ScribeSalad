00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.116
We had to make changes in two classes, the car class and the stimulation class.

00:00:06.116 --> 00:00:10.778
In the car class, we now return an ArrayList which is allocated here, we add a

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:17.605
passenger to that ArrayList, whenever one has reached his destination. And all

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:23.700
the way in the end, we return that ArrayList as the return value of the method.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.590
Did you modify the Java Doc, to add an add return statement. If so, pat

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.170
yourself in the back. In the drives car method, we call the drive method. That

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.436
returns an ArrayList. For each person in that ArrayList, we print the drop off

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:43.154
message. Note, that I didn't even bother to save the return value of the drive

00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:47.865
method in a variable. You can of course and you may find that it makes the code

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:53.535
easier to understand. But here I say c.drive returns an ArrayList. And for

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:59.670
every person in that ArrayList, I do something with this loop. Now, we have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.474
achieved the goal of our reorganization. The car class no longer knows anything

00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:07.996
about system.out. The Simulation class does, but that doesn't bother me so much

00:01:07.996 --> 00:01:11.636
because that simulation class also needed to know about system.in to read the

00:01:11.636 --> 00:01:17.698
user input. So the simulation class deals with input and output, the car and

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:22.690
person class are blessedly unaware of that. Congratulations for having worked

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.370
through such a complex example. Real life code does look like that, with lots

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.059
of classes. And in the next unit, you will see the Java way of organizing

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:36.303
related classes.
