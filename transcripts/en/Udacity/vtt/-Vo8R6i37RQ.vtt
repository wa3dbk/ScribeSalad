00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.476
Well the price of the truck will always include the $20 initial fee so let's

00:00:04.476 --> 00:00:09.241
write that first. Then whatever the number of miles we drive we have to multiply

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:13.633
it by 2 since the cost is $2 per mile so we should add 2x to our expression and

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:18.328
what's great we can check this. If we drive 20 miles we know the cost should be

00:00:18.328 --> 00:00:23.239
$60. Let's plug in $20 and for x to make sure that that's true. Sure enough,

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:27.805
what do we find? The price is $60. This expression works.
