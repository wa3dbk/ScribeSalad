00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.719
In the last lesson, you saw how
Xcode can automatically create

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.770
a view controller and
wire it up for you.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.070
You even added a code to
this view controller.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.878
At this point you might be wondering
what is a view controller and

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.430
how do I know what methods
to override in it?

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.830
As we're going to see,
the documentation will be our guide.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.730
The view controller is a special kind of
class that, as the name implies,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.990
controls a view and handles all of
the actions required by that view.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.950
In iOS development,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.009
this means that this class is usually
a subclass of UIViewController.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.750
Inherited from the UIkit framework.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.780
The view controller is called by a OS
when certain events happen to it or

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.620
your app overall.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.500
In the beginning, your app is not
running as soon as the icon is pressed

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.855
in moves through the inactive state and
immediately into the active state.

00:00:49.855 --> 00:00:52.735
When an event happens,
maybe a phone call or

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:54.705
the user decides to go to another app,

00:00:54.705 --> 00:00:58.972
your app will transition to the inactive
state and then to the background.

00:00:58.972 --> 00:01:00.382
&gt;From the background state,

00:01:00.382 --> 00:01:03.152
after a few seconds it will
go to the suspended state.

00:01:04.282 --> 00:01:06.942
What happens when the user
wants to go back to your app?

00:01:06.942 --> 00:01:08.092
If your app is in the background,

00:01:08.092 --> 00:01:11.780
it will go through the inactive
state to being active.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.620
Last but not least,
if iOS needs more memory and

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.900
your app is in suspended state and
may be moved off memory entirely,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.420
and we're back to the beginning of
this diagram to the not running state.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.360
How do I know or functions UIV
controllers has that I should override?

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.120
How do I know which
functions get called and

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.190
then the what events
in this state diagram?

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.220
It's all in the documentation and it's
always the first place you should look.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.450
Now, it's a good time to learn how
to open up documentation in Xcode.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.120
Let's open up the ViewController.swift
file, and navigate to the top.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.230
Here, you can see the line this
shows that the ViewController

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.220
class inherits from UIViewController.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.970
If you hold down the option key,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.000
you can see that the cursor changes to
a question mark when we go over a class.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.330
In this example, UIViewController.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.990
If we click once,
we can see a contextual manual come up

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.807
showing us all the information
about the UIViewController class.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.210
Clicking anywhere else
dismisses this contextual menu.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.730
If you click anywhere you can
dismiss the documentation pop up.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.030
Another way to see the full
documentation is to hold down the option

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.457
key but this time double click
on the UIViewController class.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.580
This will show you the documentation
window and open it in full screen.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.000
Showing us UIViewController.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.410
Another way to view the documentation
window is to go under help and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.330
choose documentation and API reference.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.260
You can also get this window to come up
by using the key combination Shift+Cmd+0

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.080
anywhere within Xcode.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.680
Take a moment now to look for

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.000
viewDidLoad under the UI view
controller documentation.
