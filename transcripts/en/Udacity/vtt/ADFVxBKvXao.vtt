00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.550
For example, and this is a true story,

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.110
my entire family uses an application
that has geo-fencing in it.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.450
And we've specified particular
environments to be geo-fenced,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.580
such as our home,
our place of work, and our schools.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.890
Now, whenever one of us enters
of leaves on of these areas,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.270
a sound will play on
everybody else's phone.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.340
So, for example, when I get home from
work a particular sound will play.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.360
My dog has gotten to associate that
sound with one of us coming home and

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.650
he gets really excited as dogs do.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.410
So if I'm feeling
particularly mischievous,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.040
I'll play back that sound and
he'll bolt straight to the garage.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.460
I actually have to let him into
the garage and walk him around so

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.550
that he can be sure that
somebody hasn't just come home.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.880
He'll be looking for
them to see if he can find them.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.450
Now let's roll up our sleeves and

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.599
we'll build a simple geo-fence
app like this one for ourselves.
