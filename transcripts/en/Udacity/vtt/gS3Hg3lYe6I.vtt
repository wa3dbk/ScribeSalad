00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.890
This exercise is pretty straightforward. You change the material, you set two

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.866
colors and you should get this result. Notice that when you rotate around the

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.752
finished scene, the effective lighting on the sphere doesn't change as the view

00:00:11.752 --> 00:00:15.295
changes. The other thing you'll notice is that it looks pretty bad. The sphere

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:19.360
is not smooth. We see the facets, the underlying triangles. This is truly how a

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.944
sphere made out of triangles would look in the real world. How do we make it

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:24.463
look good in our virtual world?
