00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.430
Now that you're going to be putting
another computer out there on

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.100
the Internet, accessible by anyone,
we need to discuss security.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.240
Not only for
your own application's sake, but

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.530
for everyone else out there as well.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.560
If a bad guy gets access to your server,
they can do anything they want with it.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.530
Send spam, launch denial of
service attacks, and so much more.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.930
In this lesson we'll discuss
a number of security-related topics,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.330
including managing users, packages or

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.770
the software installed on the server,
various methods of authenticating users,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.680
how Linux manages file permissions, and
finally, how to configure a firewall.
