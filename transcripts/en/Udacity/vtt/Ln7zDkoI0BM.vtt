00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.904
Now that we know that we want to discuss the distance Athena has driven and the

00:00:03.904 --> 00:00:07.930
time she spent driving, which of the following statements makes the most sense

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.997
in the context of her story. Do you think that time spent driving and distance

00:00:11.997 --> 00:00:16.010
driven are not related? Do you think that time spent driving depends on distance

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.829
driven? Or, do you think that distance driven depends on time spent driving?
