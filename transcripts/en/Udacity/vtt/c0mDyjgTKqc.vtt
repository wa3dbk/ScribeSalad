00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:04.408
But the interesting thing that we can do in something like NVVP

00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:12.413
is we can go in and we can analyze the program. So this is going to run the program many times.

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:16.317
It's collecting a bunch of statistics about the program, it's averaging them together,

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:23.259
and now that we've done this analysis we have a lot more information about these kernels.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.763
So if I click on this you see I have more statistics over here,

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:31.773
and the one that I want to highlight for you is the global load efficiency,

00:00:31.773 --> 00:00:35.107
which tells us how efficient our global loads were.

00:00:35.107 --> 00:00:40.885
In other words, of all of the bytes that we fetched with each memory transaction, how many of them are actually useful?

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:46.019
100%, looks pretty good. That's what we would expect from fully coalesced accesses.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.951
The global store efficiency, our stores to global memory,

00:00:49.951 --> 00:00:52.129
which in our case is writing the output matrix,

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.165
achieved 12.5%, and that's pretty wretched, right,

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:58.729
and that's again what we would expect from having inspected the code.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:07.337
Our total DRAM utilization is down at 7.6%, again remember this is not going to exactly match what we calculated outside the profiler,

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:09.505
but we can tell that there's a problem.

00:01:09.505 --> 00:01:12.383
That was the parallel per-row kernel but only had a single thread block.

00:01:12.383 --> 00:01:18.584
We can see that the parallel per-element kernel doesn't do much better.

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:23.669
It has slightly higher global store efficiency. Very slightly higher DRAM utilization.

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:31.227
So, we've still got this problem. Our problem is clearly our ability to write to the output matrix is hampered.

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.897
We're not achieving the bandwidth that we ought to.

00:01:33.897 --> 00:01:41.253
As I said before, I'm not intending to go through all the many, many things that you can analyze in NVVP.

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:43.946
I'll pull it up once or twice again in the course of this lecture

00:01:43.946 --> 00:01:48.256
to just illustrate that there are tools to help you figure out what's going on.

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:55.452
You can see, in fact, that down here it's actually analyzing the program for you and giving you some suggestions.

00:01:55.452 --> 00:01:59.504
It's saying look the multiprocessors in your program are mostly idle,

00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:03.257
you're not getting a lot of work done for the total amount of time this program runs,

00:02:03.257 --> 00:02:07.961
and your total compute to mem copy efficiency is low; in other words,

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:12.268
you're not doing a lot of computation given the amount of time that you spend doing mem copies.

00:02:12.268 --> 00:02:17.041
Here's the mem copies in our timeline. You can see that we spent, you know, 2 point,

00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:22.753
let's see, 2.6 milliseconds copying information in and then

00:02:22.753 --> 00:02:29.003
8 milliseconds processing it and then another 2.6 milliseconds copying it out.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:32.823
So it warns us, hey, the total compute to mem copy efficiency is low.

00:02:32.823 --> 00:02:36.722
So these are really useful tools, you should use them. You should know about them,

00:02:36.722 --> 00:02:40.569
but we're not going to rely on them too much in this class because our point is to teach

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.040
you how to reason about things from from first principles.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.103
So, our problem is bad coalescing on the write to the output matrix. What can we do about that?
