00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.190
Hidden columns essentially
hides columns based on

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.270
their importance as
the viewports size gets smaller.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.570
Let's see how you might do this
with a baseball scoreboard.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.090
As you can see all of the data is there.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.690
The short name, the long name and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.400
the runs scored during each of
the innings plus the final score.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.740
I'm going to start small and ask myself
what's the most important information.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.980
In this case, I'm going to go with
the short team name and the final score.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.180
I'm going to use display none,
to hide everything else.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.220
Then as the viewport size gets bigger,
let's swap out the full team name and

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.960
start showing each of
the runs per inning.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.150
The biggest problem of hidden columns
is that you're hiding content

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.240
from the user.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.370
What happens if I need to know how many
runs were scored in the 7th inning?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.990
If I'm a device with a narrow viewport,
it's just not there, I can't see it.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.860
So use this technique with caution.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.090
And if possible, use abbreviated data
instead of hiding it completely.
