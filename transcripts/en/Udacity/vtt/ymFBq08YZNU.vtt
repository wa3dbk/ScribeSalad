00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.640
This matrix vector multiply example
gives us a chance to introduce a couple

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.055
of pseudocode shortcuts.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:09.890
The shortcuts are all based on
expressing operations on arrays

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.060
as vector operations.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.160
So you see a hint of that here.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
Notice the declaration of
the temporary array t.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
I've used this,
what's called vector slicing notation.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.160
That is indexing with a range of values,
in this case 1 to n.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.740
Let's see where else we
can insert that notation.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.720
Let's take a look at this
inner most parfor loop.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.020
What's it doing?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.877
Well, it's basically taking a slice
of this two dimensional matrix and

00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:40.600
multiplying it component wise or
element wise with this vector x.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.060
So I can express this parfor loop in a
more compact single line of pseudocode.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.650
So I basically recognize that
all these objects are arrays.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.920
t, A sub i, and x.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.760
The arrays are all of length n.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.680
And they're all indexed
in the range 1 to n.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.920
Now this notation is common in
a bunch of modern languages.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.736
That includes Python,
Matlab and Cray Fortran.

00:01:06.736 --> 00:01:07.896
Cray who?

00:01:07.896 --> 00:01:12.590
Now if the range is the entire range of
the array object, then we can replace

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.830
the explicate range in this case 1 to n,
with just a colon meaning all elements.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.215
So that will give us an even
sightly more compact notation.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.050
Let's go ahead and plug that in.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.920
And of course we're all mature enough
to see that this vector operation

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.160
can be easily converted
into a parallel for loop.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.220
So when you are analyzing pseudocode
that includes these kinds of vector

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.492
operations, just go ahead and
use the right work and span.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.230
So in particular, these element wise
operations will have linear work and

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.510
logarithmic span.

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.620
Now we'll allow ourselves to use
a second simplification which is to get

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.870
rid of the temporary array.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.300
So it's understood that this element
wise product has to produce a temporary

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.900
intermediate element wise result.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.230
Which we then pass to the reduce, so

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.410
we can combine these
into a single statement.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.670
Again, the only subtle
thing is that this produces

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.430
a bunch of intermediate values.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.710
So that may require a temporary.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.690
So if I ask you to
analyze storage costs,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.340
then you might need to
take that into account.
