00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.199
The vertex of the parabola y equals x minus 7, squared, plus 5 is at 7,5. The

00:00:05.199 --> 00:00:10.611
way we originally have this equation written, there is no constant term next to

00:00:10.611 --> 00:00:15.799
y on the left hand side of the equation. Instead, outside of the portion of the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.866
equation, where x is being modified, there's another constant term. It isn't

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:25.354
receiving the same kind of operations as what's inside the parentheses here with

00:00:25.354 --> 00:00:29.628
the x. To get this in the form that we've been working with, we need to subtract

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:33.967
5 from both sides of the equation. That gives us an equation of y minus 5 equals

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:39.102
the quantity x minus 7 squared. From here, we can see that this graph should be

00:00:39.102 --> 00:00:44.125
shifted 7 to the right, and up 5 from the parent graph. So that gives us a

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:49.593
vertex of 7, 5. For your viewing pleasure, here is that curve. The black one is

00:00:49.593 --> 00:00:54.894
y equals x squared, and this green one is our new graph. Here I've written its

00:00:54.894 --> 00:00:59.103
equation in the form that I prefer, so that we can see very easily where the

00:00:59.103 --> 00:00:59.758
vertex is.
