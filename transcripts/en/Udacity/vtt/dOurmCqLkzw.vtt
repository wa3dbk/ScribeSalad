00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Congratulations on mastering nested environment frames and variable lookups.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
While it might seem a bit foreign now,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this notion of looking up a variable in an environment

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is very common in languages like PHP,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Ruby, JavaScript, or Python.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's how it's done in the real world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Identifiers like home or friend

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
may not mean the same thing in all contexts.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
My home may not be the same as your home.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My friends may not be the same as your friends.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But we both have homes, and we both have friends.

00:00:33.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This is an area where your intuition will really guide you to the right answer.
