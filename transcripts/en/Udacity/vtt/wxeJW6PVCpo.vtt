00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.234
Alcohol has what's known as a disinhibitory effect. This disinhibition means

00:00:04.234 --> 00:00:06.817
that people are going to do things when they're drinking that they wouldn't

00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:11.492
normally do. That's what we mean by risky behaviors when people are intoxicated

00:00:11.492 --> 00:00:15.970
they'll do things they wouldn't do when they're sober. This could be why people

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.398
get into so much trouble when they've been drinking. People can't think

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:24.150
clearly, and they act inappropriately to their impulses. They also think in the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.120
here-and-now, they don't necessarily think about the future or consequences

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.750
that can lead to a lot of trouble. But for now, let's switch gears and let's go

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.670
talk to Susan about the effect alcohol has on the body.
