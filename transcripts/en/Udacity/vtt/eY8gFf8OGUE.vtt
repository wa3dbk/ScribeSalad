00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.160
You've just worked through a batch of tricky problems with Sarah. And maybe the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.180
results of the programs were not always what you expected. That's why it's such

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.010
a good idea to test your programs to see that they produce the right result.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.440
Testing is incredibly important in software engineering. And when testing isn't

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.888
done right, the results can be quite dramatic. Over here, you see the lift off

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:30.590
of a rocket, an Ariane rockets off the European space agency that unfortunately

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.450
a few seconds afterward explodes in midair. Now what happened here is that the

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.333
rocket had a device to maintain its position and it actually had two backups.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:47.310
And because of that, the rocket engineers didn't think they had to test it. But

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.210
both back ups failed for the exact same reason actually and testing really

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.500
would have been beneficial in this case. So let's learn more about how you can

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.750
test your own programs. Okay, here we are in BlueJ, and I'm going to write a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.010
program that tests the translate method of rectangles. Let's have a look. Here,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.510
we construct a rectangle, we call the translate method. We print out what

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.050
happens to the x coordinate and we also print out what happens to the width of

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.515
the rectangle. And now for the important part. The important part is that

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:29.090
before compiling the program, we also think what should it do? And it is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.920
really, really important that you think about that right when you write your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.045
test program. Here is a super easy way of doing that. You simply add a print

00:01:39.045 --> 00:01:45.950
statement that prints what you expect that this program should do. Hmm, what do

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.160
we expect? Let's see. The x coordinate of the rectangle is at 5, the y

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.840
coordinate is at 10. And now, we translate it by 25 pixels to the right and 15

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.910
pixels down. So we have a 5. Translated by 25 pixels, so we expect that the x

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.580
coordinate is now 30 pixels, and that's what I'm putting here. What about the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.800
width? The width is 60 and moving the rectangle shouldn't change it, so we'll

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.560
expect this to be 60 again. So this is a good example of a Tester program. We

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.775
do something. We print the results and we print the expected results. let's

00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:33.950
quickly run the program. We have the actual x position of 30 and the expected

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.380
position of 30. And similarly we have the actual width of 60 at the expected

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.080
width of 60 so the actual and the expected Matchup. That's great. So, the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.710
simple lesson is always print the actual and the expected results. Sarah has an

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.560
activity where you can write you're own test program and practice this.
