Well, if we're to deal with this challenge of increasing growth in distributed

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.950
applications, we should consider what kinds of technologies we can use to

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.264
support them. One category are technologies that provide abstractions, okay?

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:19.505
In particular, the abstractions take the form of interfaces realized as

00:00:19.505 --> 00:00:23.986
application programmer interfaces, or APIs, such as Ajax or

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:28.714
Enterprise JavaBeans. Standards, think HTTP or

00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:33.021
new kinds of architectures such as REST architectures or

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:39.822
service oriented architectures. similarly, the development of new notations.

00:00:39.822 --> 00:00:45.751
Over the last, maybe ten years we've seen the increasing penetration of

00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:51.420
XML into applications. And similarly, there's been the development of tools and

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.004
that support the development of these kinds of systems such as WebSphere or

00:00:56.004 --> 00:00:59.330
Hibernate. You may have heard of those. In the design space,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.891
there's Oracle's Fusion and there are even code generators for,

00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:07.010
for transforming or generating the XML such as XSLT.
