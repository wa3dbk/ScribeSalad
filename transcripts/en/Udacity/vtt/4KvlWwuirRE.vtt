00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.010
Here is how you complete the largest method. For simplicity, I'd put objects i

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.790
and another variable that I call current. You don't strictly have to do that.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.725
And now I have to check whether current is bigger than largestSoFar. Well,

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:16.071
they're objects so I can't compare them directly. I have to compare their

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:21.035
measures. Is the measure of current bigger than the measure of the largest so

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:26.598
far? If so, I changed my mind about who's the LargestSoFar. It's exactly the

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:29.874
same algorithm that you've seen in lesson seven, now applied to measurable

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:36.830
objects. Let's run the tester. And we see what the most fuel efficient car is.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.640
Not surprisingly, it's an electric one.
