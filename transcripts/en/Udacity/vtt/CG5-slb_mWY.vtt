00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.750
So now that I have a good
understanding of do_GET,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.460
let's take this web server to the next
level with some post functionality.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.600
Gets are good for viewing information
all ready on the server, but

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.120
posts are what allow the user to
customize their web experience.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.630
Get requests happen simply by
visiting the URL in a browser, but

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.910
post requests from a browser require
data to be submitted, like with a form.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.505
I'm going to add a post method such that
our server doesn't just say hello or

00:00:24.505 --> 00:00:27.125
hola, but whatever the user
prompts as a salutation.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:28.810
On the same level as my do_GET method,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.180
I will create another method called
do_POST, which overrides the method in

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.205
the base http request handler
superclass, just like doGet.

00:00:36.205 --> 00:00:39.715
I'll make another try except block,
similar to my do_GET method.

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:41.245
When I receive a post request,

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:44.655
I'll send off the response code
that indicates a successful post.

00:00:44.655 --> 00:00:48.015
Next, I need to decipher the message
that was sent from the server.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:51.305
In order to do this, I'm going to
use some message from the CGI,

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.100
or common gateway interface,
library in Python.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.010
So I'll add import cgi
to the top of my file.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.920
Let's take a look at the following
chunk of code I'm going to add.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.120
This cgi.parse_header function parses an
HTML form header, such as content type,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.790
into a main value and
dictionary of parameters.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.020
After that, we check and
see if this is form data being received.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.740
I then make a variable called fields,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.980
which we use the cgi.parse_multipart
to collect all of the fields in a form.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.130
Then I will make a variable called
messagecontent to get out the value of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.830
a specific field or set of fields and
store them in an array.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.570
I will call this field message here,
and when I create my HTML form.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.540
So now that I've
received a post request,

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.200
I can decide what to tell the client
with the new information I've received.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.260
I will create an empty string
named output again and

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.540
then add some opening HTML tags to it.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.130
I'll have my server respond with,
okay, how about this.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.540
And then return the first value of
the array that was created when I

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.310
submitted the form.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.040
Hm?

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.270
Well you might be thinking, hey, you
haven't even created an HTML form, but

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.240
keep talking about it
in the post handler.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.170
And you'd be right.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.840
So I'll go ahead and do that now.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.740
In this line of HTML code, I'm adding a
post request along with the header tag,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.970
to prompt the user to input some data.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.840
Here, I wrote the name of my input
field as message, to coincide with

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.538
the message field I'm extracting
data from in the post request.

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:11.845
I'm going to copy this line of code and
paste it into my hello and

00:02:11.845 --> 00:02:15.690
hola get requests, so this form will
be present on their pages as well.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.840
I will also separate out my opening and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.960
closing HTML tags on
their own line of code.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.930
Let me not forget to close the body and
html tags in my post handler.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.720
Send the output out to the server and
print out the output for debugging.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.780
In my exception block,
I will just leave it as pass for now.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.120
Let's see these new changes in
action from the web browser.
