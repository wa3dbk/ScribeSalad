00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.730
I've started out by just writing L2 minus L1. And we can notice that both of

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.986
these have a factor of 10. So let's just go ahead and pull that out. So

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:15.640
factoring out that 10 and then also distributing this minus sign to both terms

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.610
inside the second parenthesis, gives us this. 10 times log of 2P minus log of

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.470
B. Minus log of P plus log of B. Something that pops out in this expression is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.920
that we have a minus log of B and a plus log of B. So these two things are

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.910
going to cancel each other out, awesome. That's how we get rid of that B and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.620
that's why we didn't need to know its actual value. Looking at what this

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.250
equations reduces to then, we can see how much simpler everything is. We still

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.000
however have another variable left in here. What do we do with this P? Well I

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.700
think that we have to bring back our quotient rule again. But this time we are

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.480
going to use it in the reverse order from how we did before. We're going to

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.090
condense this expression into just a single log. This gives us 10 times log

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:12.130
base 10 of 2P over P. Well, and look at that, if we divide 2P by P, these Ps

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.255
just cancel each other out. That's going to leave us with something super easy.

00:01:16.255 --> 00:01:19.749
10 times log base 10 of 2. This is just a number, let's use the calculator to

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:21.759
evaluate this. We have 10 times log base 10 of 2. That's equal to 3.01 etc.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:37.794
Which I'm going to round to just 3, so our answer is about 3 decibels.
