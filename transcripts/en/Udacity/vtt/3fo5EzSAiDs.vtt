00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For reasons that I don't really understand, lots of really important statistics start with the letter M.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Today's statistics have been brought to you by the letter M. Here are some of the statistics.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Maximum is the largest value in L, minimum is the smallest value in L,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the midpoint is the average of the max and the min--sort of the halfway

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
point between the largest value and the smallest value.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The mean is the average of the values in L--we all say mean sometimes or average sometimes

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
also expected value--basically it means the same thing.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The mode is the most common value in L if there's repeat.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The median is say the middlest number, the middlest value in L--basically the numbers

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
are that half the numbers are bigger and half the numbers are smaller and that there can be ties,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so we'll have to be a little bit careful how we define that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But essentially it is the value that would be in the middle of the sorted list.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And all these different notions of statistics all give us a way of taking a really long list of values

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and then grinding them together to make a single number that fits comfortably inside of our brains.
