00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.400
Okay, so. We've got this new technique for that,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.010
that we just learned. About a hash thing. So we're

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.060
going to use this and our cookie to prevent people from

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.970
cheating. Remember we had that example where it, it kept

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.390
a count. And we want to use hashing to

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.560
verify on, if that count is valid And the algorithm's

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.840
going to look something like this. So instead of just saying

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.170
set cookie visits equal five, which an, anybody can edit,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.420
we're going to add a hash to this. So we're going to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.750
send something like this instead. Set cookie equals five. We're going to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.970
add something on the end of this. So we'll add

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.310
a comma, and then we're going to add a hash of the

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.600
value here five. So that, a would be cheater can't

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.266
forge a cookie without knowing what hashing algorithm we used. So

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:46.530
we sent this cookie with five followed by, you know, our

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.202
hex string, you know, abc one, two three, it'll be whatever

00:00:50.202 --> 00:00:52.770
the output of our hash was. When we receive this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.530
cookie from the browser, we'll receive this five, you know, followed

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.110
by our hash, what we're going to do is we're going to break

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.630
this apart into two pieces. You know this will be like

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.800
our our value and this will be our hash. We're

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.900
going to hash this value and check to see check to

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.350
see if it equals this hash and if it does, we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.190
know this value hasn't been tampered with and if it doesn't,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.020
we know the cookie's invalid and we can throw it out. So our codes going

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.830
to look something like this. We we split apart the cookie value, based on this

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.000
comma into two parts, value and and hash and then we rehash the value and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.510
if it matches the one we sent we know that our cookie hasn't be tampered with.
