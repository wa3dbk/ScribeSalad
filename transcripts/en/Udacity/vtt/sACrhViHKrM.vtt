The design study itself is presented in a report. It may include charts, tables,

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.080
graphs and screenshots, as well as, as well as descriptive text. It is,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.100
however, not a narrative, but a dish, dispassionate description of a systematic

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.210
exploration. I want your reports to be professional in quality. This means that

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.730
you should treat it like you would if you were preparing to show it to customers

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.070
or submit it for publications. Its spelling and grammar should be checked, and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.900
it should be carefully proofread by a team member other than its author.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.730
We will now go through each of the sections of the report, indicating what

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.070
is expected in that section. This should also give you an idea of what you

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.619
need to do during the study itself to gather the data that goes into the report.
