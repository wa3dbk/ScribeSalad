00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.370
This would be our solution, great work if you found it. We want to start by

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.274
finding the lowest common denominator, so we should factor each of these

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:13.526
denominators. We factored this denominator to be m plus 1 times m minus 5. This

00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:18.150
denominator, we'll need to use factoring by grouping. You need to find factors

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.273
of 30 that sum to negative 13. Those factors are negative 3 and negative 10.

00:00:23.273 --> 00:00:29.046
They multiply to give us positive 30, and they add or sum to give us negative

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:33.680
13. We use our factoring tree method to get this lowest common denominator. We

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.300
multiply our first fraction by the missing factor of two m minus three, whereas

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.566
we multiply our second fraction by the missing factor of m plus one. And

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:47.050
remember, we're really just multiplying by a one here and a one here. We're

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.175
changing these fractions into equivalent forms. We distribute m to 2m minus 3 to

00:00:53.175 --> 00:00:59.708
get the first numerator, 2m squared minus 3m. Next, we distribute the negative 3

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:05.272
to the m plus 1. We'll get negative 3m and negative 3. Now, we want to add the

00:01:05.272 --> 00:01:10.102
two numerators together and keep our denominator the same. The like terms in

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:16.972
these numerators are negative 3m and negative 3m. So we have 2 m squared, minus

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:21.688
6 m, and minus 3. Finally we want to check to see if this is factor able. We

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:29.718
want to find factors of -6, that's sum to -6. Well there are no factor pairs of

00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:34.868
-6 that sum to you -6. So we're finished. So really subtracting rational

00:01:34.868 --> 00:01:39.132
expressions is not that different from adding them. We just want to make sure we

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.333
remember to distribute the negative sign.
