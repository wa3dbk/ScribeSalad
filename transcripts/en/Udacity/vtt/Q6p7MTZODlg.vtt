00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.369
So here are our three answers. We have p inverse of x equals x plus 1, q

00:00:04.369 --> 00:00:09.030
inverse of x equals one fourth times x minus 9, and r inverse of x equals x

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.248
cubed. I've done the work in the same way as last time including the color

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:18.170
change, when we switch from the original function to the inverse function. And

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.420
what's really important to notice about this quiz is that the equations we end

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.545
up with in the end. As the inverses of these functions, are the equations we

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:30.024
stared out with in the quiz before this one. We started with f of x equals x

00:00:30.024 --> 00:00:35.898
plus 1, and found that it's inverse was f inverse of x equals x minus 1. We

00:00:35.898 --> 00:00:39.438
ended up with this, 4x plus 9, by taking the inverse of a function that was

00:00:39.438 --> 00:00:44.588
equal to this one. And the same is true of this equation. I'd like you to mull

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:47.009
this over and keep it in mind.
