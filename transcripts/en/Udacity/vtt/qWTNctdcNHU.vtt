So salivation is a reflex, when we put the sour candy in our mouth we

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:09.585
automatically salivate. Coughing is also a reflex that happens automatically

00:00:09.585 --> 00:00:16.142
when particular stimuli affect your throat. Eye blink is also a reflex. And

00:00:16.142 --> 00:00:19.600
even our startle response. Do you remember the loud noise you heard in the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.794
earlier video? Perhaps that caused a startle response or even Gregg's startle

00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:28.855
response by getting hit by the toy gun. The other responses clapping, skipping,

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:32.761
eating and talking do not happen automatically in response to particular

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.020
stimuli, so they are not reflexes.
