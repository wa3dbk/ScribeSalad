00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.540
Challenge accepted. We're going to look at a a

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.930
function called the sigmoid. Sigmoid meaning s-like, right, sig,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.290
sigma-ish, sigmoid. So we're going to define this, this,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.530
the sigmoid using the letter. Sigma and it's going to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.300
be applied to the activation just like we

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.450
were doing before, but instead of thresholding it at

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.450
zero, what it's instead going to do is

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.760
compute this function of a, one over one plus

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.090
e to the, e to the minus a, and what do we

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.760
know about this function? Well, it is. Ought to be clear that

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.290
as the activation gets less and less and less, we'd want it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.030
to go to zero, and in fact it does, right. So, as

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.940
a goes to negative infinity, the negative a goes to infinity. E

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.880
to the infinity is something really, really big. So it's one over

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.110
1 plus something really big, which is like 1 over something huge,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.010
which is almost zero. So, the sigmoid function goes toward, this function

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.950
that we defined here, goes to zero as the activation goes.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.890
To negative infinity, that's great, that's just like threshold, and as

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.590
the activation gets really really large, we're talking about e to

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.430
the minus something really large, which is like e to the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.110
almost, or like e to the negative infinity which is like

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.180
almost zero, so one over one plus zero is essentially one.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.740
So on the one limit, it go towards zero, and the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.090
other limit it goes towards one, and in fact we can

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.820
just Draw this so you can see what it really

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.410
looks like you know, minus five and below it's essentially at

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.700
zero, and then it makes this kind of gradual, you can see

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.940
why it's sigmoid s-shaped curve, then it comes back up to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.800
the top and it's basically at one by the time it

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.270
get to five. So instead of just an abrupt of transition

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.570
to zero, we had this gradual transition between negative five and

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.160
five. And this is great because it's differentiable, so. What do

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.250
you think Charles, does this answer your question?

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.690
&gt;&gt; It does, I buy that.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.800
&gt;&gt; Alright good so if we have units

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.420
like this now we can take derivatives which

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.910
means we can use this gradient decent idea all over the place. So not only is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.280
this function differentiable but the derivative itself has

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.110
a very beautiful form. In particular it turns

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.060
out... That if you take the derivative of

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.450
this sigma function, it can be written as the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.880
function itself times one minus the function itself. So this is

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.110
just, this is just really elegant and simple. So, if you have,

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.650
you know, the sigma function in your code, there's nothing special that

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.120
you need for the derivative. You could just compute it this way.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.980
So we would, it's not a bad exercise to go through and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.290
do this. Practice your calculus, we just did this together but it's

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.980
not that fun to watch. So I would suggest doing it on

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.180
your own, and if you have any trouble we'll, we'll provide additional

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.410
information for you to, to help you work that out.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.976
&gt;&gt; But when you do it on your own make sure that no one is watching.

00:02:37.976 --> 00:02:40.620
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well they can watch, they just

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.480
probably won't enjoy it very much. So, so can

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.200
we say anything about why this form kind

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.470
of makes sense? So, so what's neat about this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.010
is. As we, as our activation gets very,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.960
very negative, then our sigma value gets closer and

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.890
closer to zero. And if you look at what

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.350
our derivative is there, it's something like zero times

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.660
something like one minus zero, whereas the derivative as

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.570
you get to very, very large as, that's like

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.350
sigma's going to one. And you get 1 times

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.550
1 minus 1 minus 1, so essentially 1 times 0.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.900
So you can see the derivatives flatten out for

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.600
very large and very negative a's. And when a is

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.630
like, zero, so what happens when a is like

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.390
zero? Boy, what does happen when a is like zero?

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.190
Charles, what happens if we plug zero into this sigma function?

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.840
&gt;&gt; You get one half.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.654
&gt;&gt; Is that obvious? Oh, I see, because e to the minus

00:03:29.654 --> 00:03:32.939
a, that's zero, so e to the zero is one, one over one

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.870
plus one, so a half. And then our derivative at that point

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.100
is a half times a half, or a quarter, so that's kind of neat.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.535
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:42.980
&gt;&gt; So so this is really, this, it's, it's in

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.460
a very nice form for being able to work with it.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.400
&gt;&gt; But it's probably worth saying that.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.350
Surely you could use other functions that are

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.360
different, and there might be good reasons to do

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.360
that. This one just happens to be a very

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.820
nice way of dealing with the threshold in question.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah and there's other ways that are also nice. So again,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.040
the main properties here are that as activation gets very negative it goes

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.720
to zero, as activation gets very positive it goes to one, and

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.390
there's this smooth transition in between,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.140
there's other ways of making that shape.
