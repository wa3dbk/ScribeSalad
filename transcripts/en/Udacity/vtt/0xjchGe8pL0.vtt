00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.102
So now that we have seen
what the cache line is and

00:00:03.102 --> 00:00:05.941
what its size does let's
do a quiz about that.

00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:10.888
So which of these are not good
line sizes in a 2 kB cache?

00:00:10.888 --> 00:00:17.860
1 byte, 32 bytes, 48 bytes,
64 bytes And 1 kB.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.850
Again, we are looking for

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.410
those that are not good line
sizes in a cache of 2 kB size.
