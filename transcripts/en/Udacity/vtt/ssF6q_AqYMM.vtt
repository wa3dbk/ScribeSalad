Rio Vista is a very interesting thought experiment. It basically shows

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.770
how, if you change the starting assumptions for ae problem, you can come to

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.810
a completely different design point. In this case, the starting assumption was

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.180
that source of crashes was only

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.080
software, not power failure. That changes everything.
