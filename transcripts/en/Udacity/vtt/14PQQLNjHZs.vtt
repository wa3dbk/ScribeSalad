00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.483
So here's another thing that we know,
that is if we run value iteration,

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:07.071
we get a series of value functions,
say Vt.

00:00:07.071 --> 00:00:10.416
If we compare the value function
we have at some time step,

00:00:10.416 --> 00:00:13.898
t to the same value function that
we have one time step later,

00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:17.131
Vt plus 1, that if it basically
has stopped changing.

00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.361
If the change,
if the amount of change from Vt, sorry,

00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:26.131
from t to t plus 1 is less than
epsilon for all states in the MDP,

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:31.261
then the largest difference between
the optimal value function and

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:34.951
the value function that we get,
sorry for this.

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:39.524
But, by taking that value function,
taking the greedy policy with respect to

00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:44.307
that value function and taking the value
function of that greedy policy is small,

00:00:44.307 --> 00:00:48.141
right, so we're going to be doing
almost optimal from all states.

00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:52.120
And the smallest here ends up being
2 times that epsilon times gamma,

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.812
divided by 1, minus gamma.

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:55.739
&gt;&gt; Are you sure that's
intuitively obvious?

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.016
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH], well maybe not
intuitively obvious, but the Sing and

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:01.096
Yi proof of this is not so complicated,

00:01:01.096 --> 00:01:04.068
not so different from the stuff
that we've been doing.

00:01:04.068 --> 00:01:07.538
And you get the 1 over 1 minus gamma
because this little bit of epsilon that

00:01:07.538 --> 00:01:11.065
we could be off, could get magnified
over every single step as we think about

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:12.128
this into the future.

00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:15.018
That's why we get a 1 minus
gamma in the denominator.

00:01:15.018 --> 00:01:18.718
And then 2 epsilon, because I don't
know which side of the epsilon we're on,

00:01:18.718 --> 00:01:21.481
times gamma because it doesn't
take place right away,

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.745
it's one step from now.

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.860
So it does kind of make sense.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.840
But the real important upshot
of this is the notion that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.270
if you can get a good enough
approximation of the value function.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.696
Then you're going to have a good enough,
well,

00:01:34.696 --> 00:01:38.484
then you can at least put a bound on how
far off you are in terms of following

00:01:38.484 --> 00:01:42.400
the resulting policy from how far
that's going to be from optimal.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.110
And furthermore we don't even need
to know how close we are to V star,

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.460
all we need for
this result to hold is, we look at

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.050
two consecutive iterations of value
iteration, right, which that we have.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.130
We're running value iteration.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.690
We know what it was a step ago,
we know what it is now.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.250
And so we can compute this epsilon and

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.350
that gives us a bound on what if we
just stop now and follow that policy.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.480
So that's a really useful thing.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.760
Otherwise, knowing that
valuation converges in the limit

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.110
is not super duper helpful, because
you're never going to get to the limit.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.500
And knowing that value iteration
eventually is optimal, even if finite

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.290
is still not that helpful, because
you don't know when that takes place.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.900
So what this is telling us is,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.200
we can actually test on our own,
when is a decent time to stop.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.910
&gt;&gt; So that's cool.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.780
So here's something I just noticed.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.000
If I look at both your 1 and 2,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.775
I noticed that they both would
encourage you to pick small gammas.

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:32.970
&gt;&gt; Mm.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:33.630
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.730
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is certainly the case
that if gamma is really tiny,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.600
like if gamma is 0 then
this bound stays small.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.340
This bound stays small.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.850
It's all good.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.880
The closer gamma gets to 1,
the more things are problematic.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.760
But what do you infer from that?

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.160
&gt;&gt; Well, mainly why is that?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.030
Well, that's because gamma really
tells you what your horizon is.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.295
And so the smaller gamma is, the sort of
further into the future you don't look.

00:02:58.295 --> 00:02:59.730
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; If that makes sense.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.880
And so that makes sense then, right?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.080
That if I'm not really worried about the
future, then it doesn't take much for

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.281
me to be doing what
appears to be optimal.

00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:09.767
&gt;&gt; Yes.
That's right.

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:13.340
Right, it's easy to optimize
over a very short horizon.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.115
And the horizon,

00:03:14.115 --> 00:03:17.280
the effective horizon is always
something like 1 over 1 minus gamma.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.605
That's kind of how far into the future
do rewards actually matter.

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:22.464
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:28.036
&gt;&gt; And so right, so gamma closer to 1,
is really looking ahead a lot further.

00:03:28.036 --> 00:03:31.460
And that's why it's
a harder problem to do.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.145
It's harder to get things exactly right.

00:03:33.145 --> 00:03:36.971
&gt;&gt; So then why, in practice,
don't we always set gamma to be really,

00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:37.858
really small?

00:03:37.858 --> 00:03:42.562
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's where I thought you were
going to go, so it's a great question.

00:03:42.562 --> 00:03:47.011
I mean one of the things that happens
if you set gamma to be something very

00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:51.701
close to 0, is the agent who's acting
in the world acts very myopically.

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:53.738
Very short term thinking.

00:03:53.738 --> 00:03:59.306
So, I feel like eating now instead
of finishing recording this lecture.

00:03:59.306 --> 00:04:01.999
So I might as well do that.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.741
Right, so you get shortsightedness.

00:04:03.741 --> 00:04:04.623
&gt;&gt; I am eating now.

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:06.782
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Well that's good for you.

00:04:06.782 --> 00:04:08.730
I am not eating now.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.590
I would like to eat now,
but I won't because I'm

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.110
sufficiently farsighted to know that
just getting something yummy to

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.019
eat right now is going to interfere
with my ability to finish this course.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.060
Because our wonderful and
talented video editor eventually

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.010
going to stop [LAUGH] processing
this stuff, and then we're hosed.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.860
So, yes.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.924
Gamma, smaller gamma
means easier problem, but

00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:33.860
more short sighted behavior.

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.319
Closer to one gamma is looking
ahead more into the distance, but

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.702
can make the computations
more difficult.

00:04:39.702 --> 00:04:43.987
&gt;&gt; So it's basically what these two
results are saying that there is a trade

00:04:43.987 --> 00:04:45.393
off between horizon and

00:04:45.393 --> 00:04:49.695
sort of feasibility of solving a problem
in a reasonable amount of time.

00:04:49.695 --> 00:04:50.252
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:04:50.252 --> 00:04:51.270
That's a good way to say it.
