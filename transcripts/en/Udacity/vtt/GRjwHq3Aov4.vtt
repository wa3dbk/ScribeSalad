00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
There's another way to look at this types of value propositions, kind of as a Venn diagram.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.310
What comes from technical insights are making things more efficient

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.200
or smaller or faster and sometimes lower cost and simpler.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.430
What comes from market insights are better distribution and bundling and branding.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.510
But sometimes what you have is this sweet spot in the middle

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.050
that actually is a combination of technical and market insights

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.754
that makes for a killer value proposition.

00:00:26.754 --> 00:00:29.608
So let's take a look at some examples of technical insights.

00:00:29.608 --> 00:00:31.411
This is a company called Ayasdi.

00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:36.271
That was an outgrowth of Stanford math department where Phd students said

00:00:36.277 --> 00:00:41.728
"Listen we can do a topological analysis of highly dimensional data to be analysed

00:00:41.728 --> 00:00:44.995
without predetermining the number of feature sets."

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:49.807
That's a mouthful but it turns out that this is the world's best way to go through

00:00:49.807 --> 00:00:56.280
big data sets, huge data sets in a way that was just computationally not possible before.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.060
And in fact once they had their technical insight

00:00:59.063 --> 00:01:03.120
they started to talk to customers about pains and gains.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.367
And it was an enormously effective product to solve problems that were so painful

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.640
that they just could't be approached before.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.958
Another example was a startup called Inscopix that mass produced components

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.906
to create a miniaturized florescence microscope.

00:01:17.906 --> 00:01:21.687
It turns out that this technical insight allowed them to

00:01:21.687 --> 00:01:24.760
reduce the size of the device that took up the table top

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.654
to that can fit now in your hand.

00:01:26.654 --> 00:01:29.020
And in fact they created an entirely new market

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.131
that solved problems that customers didn't even imagine

00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:34.706
until they actually saw this new device.

00:01:34.706 --> 00:01:37.481
On the other hand there are some examples from market insight.

00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:42.959
Zynga was one of the first companies to realize that people wanted to play games

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.100
online that were more involved than what is currently offered.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.214
They not only wanted to play solitaire but they actually wanted to play games

00:01:51.214 --> 00:01:53.558
that involved interaction with other people.

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:58.987
And their big insight was Facebook as the distribution channel for those games.

00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:01.986
Twitter, another example of market insight.

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:06.258
Masses of people are more likely to write a 140 characters

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:08.901
than a 1000 words. Everybody was skeptical.

00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.320
But it turns out that it plugged into something

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.324
that was both a market and a human nature insight.

00:02:14.324 --> 00:02:15.474
It solved a need.

00:02:15.474 --> 00:02:18.144
Zipcar's insight was actually kind of interesting.

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.200
Instead of just renting cars on business trips

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.476
it might be that people in urban areas or in college campuses no longer wanted to own cars

00:02:26.476 --> 00:02:29.733
but wanted to be able to get them with incredible flexibility

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:33.666
a lot more than traditional rental car companies offered.

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:38.216
And Zipcar actually had a market insight that made it a successful public company.
