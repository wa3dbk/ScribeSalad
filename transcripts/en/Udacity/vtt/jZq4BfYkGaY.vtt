00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.230
So going forward, these days much of
strong label recognition is really

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.470
machine learning applied to patterns
of pixel intensities, or features.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.540
And to cover this, as I said, would
require a deep understanding of machine

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.960
learning, and a class or
17 of them to learn that.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.680
So, instead, what we'll do is we're
going to focus on sort of two general

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.240
principals called generative
versus discriminative methods, and

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.470
their application and the representation
used in computer vision.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.270
And then we'll spend some time on
activity recognition from video because

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.920
why recognize pictures when you
can actually recognize activity.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.530
And besides that,
it's how I earn my tenure.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.350
All right.
Talk to you soon.
