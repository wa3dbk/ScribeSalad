00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Now, let's do the same thing again for clique.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.210
So, again, we're going to assume that we have a factor-2 approximation algorithm,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.710
and the algorithm gives you a clique for a given input.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.720
Again we're going to assume that the clique that you're getting contains 100 vertices.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.520
So now what is the maximum number of vertices in an optimum solution to clique?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.450
And what would be the minimum number of vertices that are in an optimum solution?

00:00:22.450 --> 99:59:59.000
So please, again, enter your answers here in these boxes.
