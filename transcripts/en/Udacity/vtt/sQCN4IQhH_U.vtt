00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.228
So when trying to factor this polynomial, we want to rewrite the middle x term,

00:00:05.228 --> 00:00:09.978
by finding factors of negative 24, that sum to negative 5. Try finishing this

00:00:09.978 --> 00:00:14.262
number puzzle, and factoring this trinomial. The final answer will have all of

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:18.582
the factors including the greatest common factor. So your answer should look

00:00:18.582 --> 00:00:23.812
like the GCF, a factor, and then another factor. Try your best and don't worry

00:00:23.812 --> 00:00:25.904
if it's not right on the first try.
