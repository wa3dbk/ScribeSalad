00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.630
Okay, so we're looking at, the newly added function,

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.090
audioRecorderDidFinishRecording, and in here, I want to do two things.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.870
The first thing to do, is to save the recorded audio, and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.700
the next thing I want to do, is to move to the second scene of the app.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.660
AKA perform a segue.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.080
Let's begin with step one, which is to save the recorded audio.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.360
Now, I'm looking to save two things about the recorded audio,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.170
the title of that file and the path where it is stored on the phone.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.660
I'll do that, by creating a new class called RecordedAudio.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.430
By the way, in case you're wondering, this new class.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.770
Will be the model for our app, and that will form the M of the acronym MVC.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.990
Let's create this class next.
