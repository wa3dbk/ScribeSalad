00:00:00.196 --> 00:00:05.313
It will actually return a single row 
containing the max high temperature.

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:09.265
We're using a descending order 
for this column, which will place

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:11.734
the largest value 
at the beginning of the query.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.728
The limit statement tells SQLite 
to only return a single row.

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:19.719
We return a row 
that has the largest value.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:22.515
If we wanted to get 
the most recent high,

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.817
we could order by max desc, date desc.
