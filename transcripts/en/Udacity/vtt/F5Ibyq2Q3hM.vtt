00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.530
Hello, my name is Nick Gustafson, and

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.430
I'm a data scientist at Udacity. My background

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.180
is I did my undergrad in neurobiology and

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.430
I went on in graduate school to continue

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.280
studying neurobiology, and neuroscience in particular, and

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.240
kind of, computational neuroscience and looking at algorithmic

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.750
And all mechanisms of learning and decision making.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.420
And while towards that, hm, tail end of

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.970
my graduate work I, eventually kind of realized I did not want to stay

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.480
in academia, however I still have this

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.060
kind of strong passion for analyzing data,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.950
modeling data, understanding You know, patterns within

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.190
it, and kind of, you know, applying

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790
scientific methods, and data science just, just

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.580
felt like a natural progression from there.
