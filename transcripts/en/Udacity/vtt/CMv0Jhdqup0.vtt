00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This homework is about refactoring the bridge successor function.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I want you to write a new function.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We'll call it bsuccessors3, which takes a bridge state as input,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but we're going to represent the states in a different way.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We're going to represent them not as a set that included the light,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because in the old bridge successor function--bridge successor 2--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it just seemed kind of complicated that I had to deal with the special case of are

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the elements of the sets on the here and there side--

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are they people or are they the light. It just got a little bit overly verbose.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I think maybe there's a better representation, so we're going to try a different representation.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We're going to try one where there is a set of people on the here side,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
a set of people on the there side, and then the light is going to be an index.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's going to be 0 if the flash light, the torch, is on the here side and 1 if it's on the there side.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then the tuple for the actions is going to be a little bit different.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's just going to be a set of people--the travelers that are going--then followed by the arrow.
