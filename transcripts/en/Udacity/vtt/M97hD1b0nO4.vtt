00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.236
Lewis Terman a psychologist from Stanford University created an American

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:09.549
version of an IQ Test called the Stanford-Binet test. The Stanford-Binet test

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.517
was the first to have national norms not just local ones, like the last ones we

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:19.836
saw that was localized for Paris. The Stanford-Binet tests use the same IQ

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:25.026
ratio as we talked about before. Mental age over chronological age times the

00:00:25.026 --> 00:00:30.280
average, which is 100. The test focused on three main domains, Verbal,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.740
language, Quantitative, math, and Spatial. One problem with the test, however,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.651
was that the questions they used were only for children and teenagers. So adult

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:44.668
intelligence couldn't be measured. David Weschler solved this problem by

00:00:44.668 --> 00:00:48.149
creating a test of intelligence for adults, called the Weschler Adult

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.480
Intelligence Scale. This looked at the same domains as the Stanford-Binet test.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.638
This test asked questions that were more adult appropriate. For example, why

00:00:58.638 --> 00:01:02.730
the individuals buy automobile insurance, or in what ways are boats and trains

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.175
the same. Modern versions also test working memory, with problems such as the

00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:22.400
examiner saying three numbers for example three, nine and seven. And then the

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.291
person is asked to repeat them back, or eight numbers, eight, five, nine,

00:01:24.291 --> 00:01:27.870
seven, four, three, seven, two. And again, the person has to repeat these. The

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.420
more numbers a person can recall the greater their working memory is.
