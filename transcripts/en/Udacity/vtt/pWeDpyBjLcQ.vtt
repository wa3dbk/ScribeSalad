00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:00.920
So it's really great for

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.980
startups who are getting
started with Google Analytics.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.920
There's a default implementation
that allows them to get started

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.610
really quickly and

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.640
easily with some key features that
they'll get to get right off the bat.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.930
The first one is the number
of users in sessions.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.021
The second is session duration,
they can know their operating systems,

00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:18.250
the device models, and geography.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.320
So, right off the bat they don't
have to do much because they get

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.820
that information right
off when they set it up.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.380
After that,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.940
that's when they can go even more deeper
to get some more details about users.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.204
Things like who are more likely
to buy in-app purchases,

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:33.877
people who are stopping at a certain
level for game specific app.

00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:36.810
Or if someone who just drops off and
hasn't use the app in the long time.
