00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.470
So now, the answer is infinitely many. All we needed

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.100
was these two rules and we can make infinitely many words.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.600
This is the power that recursive definitions give us. And unlike

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.280
the previous definition which was circular, what we have now is

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.000
what we call a recursive definition. That means, we have

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.270
defined word in terms of itself but that's not the only

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.680
way we've defined word. We also have this other rule that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.080
allows us to have a starting point. That there's one word

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.660
that we have that's defined not in terms of itself. So here's how we can

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.790
make infinitely many words using these rules. So

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
we can start with a non-terminal word and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.752
let's say we choose to use the first rule. We can replace word directly with

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:46.458
our [UNKNOWN] and we're done, but we have

00:00:46.458 --> 00:00:50.260
another option. We could have replaced word using

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.680
the second rule, with counter word and if we replace this word, using the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.860
second rule, we'll end with that word

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.500
counter hippo [UNKNOWN] phobia. But that's not the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.580
only choice, right, we could've chosen to use the first rule again, and then we

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.710
were to replace this word with counter-word

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.050
and so now we have counter, counter, word.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.460
Again we have the choice of what to do with this word.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.810
We could use the second rule, replace it with the terminal. And

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.850
then we'll have counter, counter hippo. Or we could replace it using

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.250
the first rule. And then we'll have counter, counter, counter followed by word.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.760
So this can keep going as long as we want.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.310
We can produce all of these words with any number of

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.350
counter, either zero, repetitions of counter one, two, three, four. As

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.000
many as we want. That means we can produce infinitely many

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.430
words. Some of them are going to be pretty hard to pronounce.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.440
Actually, they're all pretty hard to pronounce. But, there's no limit

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.330
to the number of words that we can produce this way.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.810
So this is what's called the recursive definition and the important

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.240
thing that it has is two parts. It has a base case which is here.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.220
That's the stopping condition. That's something that says

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.810
we have at least one word that we

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.610
can define already. That we don't need to define in terms of word. And it has

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.990
the recursive case that says we can define a word in terms of another word. And

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.650
if we combine those two, well now we

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.210
have a definition that can make infinitely many words.
