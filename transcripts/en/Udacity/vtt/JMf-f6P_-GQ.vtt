00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:09.499
For two to the power of X, the slope is below one. You can see that by connecting this point and that point.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:17.832
The curve passes through X equals zero, Y equals one, and X equals one, Y equals two,

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:26.032
and the same is true for this line with a slope of one. Obviously, our power function, two to the power of X,

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:35.132
makes a left turn. If it hits this straight line in these red spots, it has to dive below that red line.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:41.566
Meaning that its slope at x equals zero is less than the slope of the red line.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:49.132
Less than one. The slope of three to the power of X at X equals zero is larger than one.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:55.466
Let me add this straight line again that has a slope of one and a Y intercept of one.

00:00:55.467 --> 00:01:02.066
And if you look really closely, you'll see that this exponential function, three to the power of X and this red line

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:11.666
intersect at two points. The first intersection being close to X equals -.17. This means that the blue curve dives

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:19.533
below the red line on the left-hand side, meaning that it has to have a slope that is larger than one.
