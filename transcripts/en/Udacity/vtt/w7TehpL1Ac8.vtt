00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.930
The reason why this image is blurry,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:09.090
is because we are simulating our app on iPhone 5S, which has a retina display.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.070
Retina display means more pixels and therefore more quality.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.960
So what the simulator is looking for, is a 2x image.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.660
It's looking for

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.190
this image right here, which by the way is just two times the size of the 1x.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.838
And here I have the same microphone image,

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:29.980
except that its size is 200 by 200 pixels.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.930
This is twice as big as the previous image we used.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.720
By the way, this image is also available in the instructor notes.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.110
So what I'm going to do is drag this image into the 2x.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.190
There.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.210
All right. I'll go back to Xcode and then stop the project and run it again.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.520
Aha, the image isn't blurry anymore.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.960
By the way, this form of attention to design detail

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.140
is extremely important when building apps for the Apple ecosystem.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.090
And because it's so important, let's dive a little bit deeper into

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.000
seeing what's actually going on here behind the scenes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
The thing to understand here is that

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.810
the 1x scale factor works with non-retina phones.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.942
And these were used in old iPhones, like the iPhone 3G.

00:01:12.942 --> 00:01:17.380
The 2x scale factor, however, has a retina screen, and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.640
this is used in phones like the iPhone 4 and 5s.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.640
A phone that uses the retina screen in this case means double the number of

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.680
pixels as compared to a non retina screen.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.910
And that is what produces a much better quality for these phones.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.600
So when we use an image from 1x in a phone like iPhone 5s,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.310
the image looks somewhat blurry as this phone is expecting a 2x image.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.040
Now you can imagine that the 3x scale factor is used for

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.498
newer phones, phones like the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 plus.

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:53.170
If you want to learn more about this,

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.860
we've added a couple of helpful links in the instructor notes.
