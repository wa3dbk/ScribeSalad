00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.101
Now let's try something a little bit harder. Try multiplying these two binomials

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:07.880
together. Notice that we have a variable in the first term and in the second

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.797
term, in both binomials. Our process for multiplying works the same way, you

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:15.798
want to be careful with your exponents and combine like terms. You can put your

00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:17.045
answer here, good luck.
