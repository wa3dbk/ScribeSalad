00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
So to give you a more clear understanding about the algorithm that Alice is using,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm going to write it down in a sort of pseudo-code.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.000
That means I'm not going to write real Python code or any other programming

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.329
language that you're used to but, basically, do a more formal description of this

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.410
'trying all possibilities' algorithm.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.040
So the solution that we're looking for is going to be written into a variable

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.540
called 'minimum devices.'

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.650
And initially to start off the algorithm, we're going to set that variable to the number

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.040
of communication centers because that is the maximum number of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.230
monitoring devices that you are going to need in any case.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.370
The algorithm then goes through each assignment of the values 0 and 1 to the

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.230
communication centers.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.630
And what I mean by that is a value of 0 means that communication center

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.270
does not get a monitoring device, and a 1 means that we are going to install

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.770
a monitoring device at that communication center.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.670
The algorithm then checks if the assignment is valid.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.000
And what I mean by valid is that the communication centers that

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.170
have a 1 in the assignment are monitoring all the cables in the network.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.000
If we have a valid assignment, the algorithm then computes how many

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.490
devices we used in that assignment, which is simply summing all the 1's that are

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.440
in the current assignment that we're working on.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.260
The algorithm then checks if the current assignment is a better solution

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.460
than the best one we have found so far.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.310
And it does that by taking the minimum of the currently known best solution,

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.480
which is 'minimum devices'--here--and the number of devices

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.490
in the current assignment.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.020
If you're familiar with algorithms, you might already see a few issues--

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.800
even in this pseudo-code--with this algorithm.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.640
But we're going to go into that more deeply in Unit 3, actually.

00:01:46.640 --> 99:59:59.000
Right now, we're just going to work with this very simple version here.
