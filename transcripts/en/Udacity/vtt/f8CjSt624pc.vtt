00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.090
Now you can do this with existing files on your

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.230
computer, but if you want to follow along this example,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.540
feel free to download the zip file in the instructor

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.460
notes. When you unzip that file, you'll have a folder

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.670
much like this one, with about 50 photos. Okay, so

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.820
what I've done thus far is just created a new

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.180
file in Idle, and I called it rename_files.py. And inside

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.460
that, I've created an empty function by the same name.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.090
Then I added comments of the two main things I have to do in my program. By the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.330
way, notice that the function right now is pretty

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.220
empty, and if I saved and ran the program, it

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.780
would essentially do nothing. The first thing I have

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990
to do, is get the file names from a given

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.400
folder. So Google can help with that. Let me

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.340
just type in Find file names in a folder in

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.460
Python. Now I read through the results, and

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.100
I got to this stack overflow.com page. And here

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.270
I read that there is this thing called os.listdir,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.300
which will get you everything that's in a given

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.780
directory. Now it turns out that there is a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.970
module in Python called os, short for operating system.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.500
And that has a function inside it called listdir.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.360
Which, as its name suggests, lists everything that's in

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.890
a given directory. So let's add this to the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.350
code and see what it does. Now this function listdir

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890
takes in a path of the folder that contains our

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.323
photos. So I'll go back to my folder. Copy its

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:32.760
address, and paste it. Now for those of you who

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.270
are on a Mac, you can use a document in

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.580
the instructor notes, that will help you get the path

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.595
of your folder. On a Windows machine however, right before

00:01:41.595 --> 00:01:44.090
where the path begins, I will add this

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.210
letter r, and r stands for rawpack, and it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.560
tells Python hey, take this string as it

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.980
is, and don't interpret it any other way. So

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.510
here let me just save this in a variable, and print that out. Let me save, and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.690
then run, and oh wow, we get a list of all of the file names inside that folder.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.574
It's an ugly looking list, but a list

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:12.470
nonetheless. Alright, step one of the program is done.
