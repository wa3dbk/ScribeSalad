00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.390
As you've just seen in our solution, the car class was coupled with the system

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.893
and print stream classes simply because the car class does an output. And we'd

00:00:08.893 --> 00:00:13.768
like to reorganize the code so that that's no longer the case. Let's get going.

00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:18.184
In the tryToAdd method, we have a print statement, let's instead move that to

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:24.482
the point where tryToAdd is called. That would be in the loadPassengers method

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:28.570
of the simulation class. Go ahead and move the print statement.
