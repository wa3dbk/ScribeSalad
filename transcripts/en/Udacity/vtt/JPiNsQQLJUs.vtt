00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.650
The job of the moderator, in addition to those already mentioned, concerning

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.000
preparation and follow-up, include the following. The moderator should determine

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.990
whether the participants have done the necessary preparatory work. If necessary,

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.740
the moderator should abort the review if the team is not prepared. Why,

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.410
after all, go through an expensive meeting if it's not going to be effective?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.510
The moderator should also evaluate whether the work to be reviewed is actually

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.770
ready for review. Let's say it's a code review. And the organization has

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.240
guidelines that say, before code review the code must be completed,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.960
it must be successfully compiled and it must go through unit tests,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.940
the moderator can then check whether those events have happened and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.180
if not, send it back and reschedule the meeting. A moderator is responsible for

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.610
running the meeting. Keeping the participants on track, arbitrating any

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.420
differences, and managing time. Moderation is a skilled activity and

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.390
moderators typically have under, undergone some kind of training at the task.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.260
Finally, moderators should be technically competent, but

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.720
not necessarily expert on the specific artifact of technology being reviewed.
