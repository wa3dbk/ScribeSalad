00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.500
The first anxiety disorder that we're going to to discuss, is generalized

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.642
anxiety disorder. This is a common disorder that's characterized by a pervasive

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:13.328
and excessive, hard to control, state of anxiety, or worry, that lasts at least

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:20.153
6 months. People with generalized anxiety disorder, may also have trouble with

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:25.412
sleep. Body restlessness or agitation. Difficulty concentrating or muscle

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:32.189
tension. Adults must exhibit at least three of these symptoms. To receive a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.654
diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder. Unlike other anxiety disorders,

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:40.482
people with generalized anxiety disorder often have been anxious their whole

00:00:40.482 --> 00:00:44.194
lives, and they can't recall the particular time when they began to feel this

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:50.742
way. These people tend to worry about anything and everything, and their level

00:00:50.742 --> 00:00:56.240
of worry is not proportional to the actual threat they're worried about. A pop

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.530
culture example of an individual with generalized anxiety disorder is, Woody

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.674
Allen, the writer, director and comedian. He has said that using film making

00:01:05.674 --> 00:01:10.360
and being creative has been a distraction from his pervasive anxiety. Now

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.840
finally, it's important to remember that feeling anxious towards specific

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.206
events is totally normal. But, for people with generalized anxiety disorder,

00:01:20.206 --> 00:01:24.935
their anxiety can be debilitating. And for some, it may even prevent them from

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:26.760
being able to work.
