00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.690
Kelsey just touched on
a really important concept for

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.340
designing scalable applications,
twelve-factor apps.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.740
You can think of the twelve
factors as best-practices for

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.990
designing modern applications that
fit three really important criteria.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.830
Portability, deployability and
scalability.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.760
Twelve-factor applications are designed
to be portable, because they

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.040
focus on eliminating elements that
vary between execution environments,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.910
like dependencies and configuration.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.120
Not only that, but twelve-factor
applications are designed to be deployed

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:34.090
on cloud platforms, like GCP,
AWS, and by focusing on

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.590
keeping production in development
environments close to uniform.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.440
We can start continuously
deploying our applications,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.730
meaning we can set up tooling to roll
out updates to code very quickly.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.110
Finally, if we follow these principles
when building our applications,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.420
they'll be able to scale up to reach
our users' demands, while using most of

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.890
the same toolings and practices
we've been employing from the start.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.710
Now, Kelsey touched on a few of
the twelve-factors earlier and

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.280
how our application handles them,
but there's a lot more.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.940
The ones we didn't handle
directly in our application,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.489
we use higher level tools for later.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.590
As you can see, when it comes to
deploying apps that scale into

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.660
the cloud, writing twelve-factor
apps helps us reach that goal.
