00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All right, so now that we've mastered lexing

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or breaking up into words HTML,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
let's turn our attention to JavaScript, the other language we'll be considering in this class.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm going to introduce you to JavaScript by jumping

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
right into an example by way of a parable.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Over here on the left we see some webpage code,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
apparently a webpage owned by Steven.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Welcome to Steven's webpage.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And Steven would really like to compute five factorial, 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Over here on the left, we see the HTML source code,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and on the right we see the result as it would render.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This p tag I haven't introduced you to yet,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
but it means begin a new paragraph.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We'll write out the words "Welcome to." We'll show "Steven" in bold.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We've got this five factorial, this bang.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The exclamation mark often means factorial in mathematics.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Printed in italics you can see it slanted.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But unfortunately, Steven is super sad.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
He can't remember the value of five factorial.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, this is exactly the sort of thing that a programming language

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
like JavaScript could help us out with.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It can carry out computations just like Python,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
so we can do work in the middle of a webpage.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's write our first JavaScript script together.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Here, this line starting with script type= "text/javascript"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then this document write line, and then ending here with this closing script tag,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
all of this, these 3 lines together are a JavaScript program

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
embedded inside an HTML webpage.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
JavaScript programs always begin with this special script tag,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and this tag has an argument because there might be multiple

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
types of tags out there in the universe.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We've seen tag arguments before with the anchor tag.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Here I have an anchor tag where the argument is a hypertext reference.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Here I have a script where we're telling the web browser

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
you should treat this as a JavaScript program.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
This JavaScript program is very simple.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's the equivalent of print "Hello World" in Python.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
JavaScript's name for the print function is document.write,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
which we'll sometimes just abbreviate as write.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But the semantics, the meaning is largely the same.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's also worth noting that we've put parentheses

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
around the argument to document.write almost as if it were a mathematical function.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We can do that in Python. It's allowed, but often we don't.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And we've ended the line with a semi-colon, whereas at the end of a Python line

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we often don't have a semi-colon, but again,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you can put semi-colons at the end of Python lines.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We just typically don't.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now we're going to try to use the full phenomenal cosmic power of JavaScript

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to compute five factorial.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
To do so, I'm going to make a recursive function called--surprise, surprise--

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
factorial that's going to compute the value.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Let's walk through every part of this JavaScript code together.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The word function means I'm declaring a function.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
This is very similar to def in Python.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Then I give the name of the function, and then I write the arguments

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
just like I would in Python.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In Python I'd have a colon here, but JavaScript requires slightly different punctuation,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
this open and curly brace, and in this regard it's more like languages such as

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
C or C++ or Java or C#, curly brace languages.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Our factorial function is going to be recursive, and every recursive function

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
needs a base case, a time when it stops.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Our stopping condition is when n is 0.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
We could have picked n is less than or equal to 0,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
n is less than or equal to 1, so I have an if statement

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that's checking that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Again, in Python this would probably look very, very similar

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
except that we'd use a colon instead of an open and curly brace.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If n is 0, we return 1, and I have a semi-colon at the end of all my statements.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Then in Python, I would know that I'm done with the if statement

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
because of the tabbing.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
JavaScript doesn't use that sort of readable tabbing rule

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to figure out the control flow when an if statement ends,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
so instead you have to explicitly close off this open and curly brace

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
just like you'd have to close off a tag in HTML

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
or close off parentheses once you start them.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We're going to study this a lot more as time goes by.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I close off the then branch of my if.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I have a semi-colon, and now I have a new return statement,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and this is basically just the formula for factorial.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
It's n times the factorial of n - 1.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
This part here is a function call, in fact, a recursive function call,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
just like you'd expect to see in Python.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
I'm ending the whole thing with a semi-colon.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is the end of my function definition,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and at the end of the day I print out--

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and the JavaScript version of print is document.write--

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
factorial of 5, and over here on the right you can actually see it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We've got the 120, which is the correct value for factorial,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
so what that tells me is that if prettiness matters,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I should delete those question marks because now we are super happy

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
because we can compute five factorial using embedded JavaScript

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in the middle of a webpage, or to put it another way,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
a way that's a bit more puntastic,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
[singing] it's a good thing JavaScript can run on the page of Steven.

00:05:25.000 --> 09:59:59.000
And basically my voice is telling me not to quit my day job.
