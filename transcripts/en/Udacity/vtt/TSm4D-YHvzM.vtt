Let's assume that to get a good grade, we need a good memory. That means that we

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:10.909
have to do everything we can to boost our memory. Therefore, we might look at a

00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:16.563
bunch of different factors that influence memory. If we're doing a real research

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:21.983
study, we want to make sure that these factors really do positively influence

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:27.835
memory. But we can't analyze the relationship between these and memory without

00:00:27.847 --> 00:00:33.595
having a clear definition and way of measuring memory. So, how would you measure

00:00:33.607 --> 00:00:39.005
memory? There is no right or wrong answer. The purpose of this is just to get

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:39.935
you thinking.
