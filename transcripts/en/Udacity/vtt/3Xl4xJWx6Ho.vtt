00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.363
We've seen that if we have a constant function like y equals 1 it looks like

00:00:03.363 --> 00:00:08.326
this just a straight horizontal line. Now if we increase the degree of this by

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:12.232
one, straighten out this is a zeroth degree polynomial, if we up it by one we

00:00:12.232 --> 00:00:16.390
get something like y equals x which takes that horizontal line and just rotates

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.795
it. Now it has a nonzero slope. Now if we increase the power by one more we get

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:27.490
a parabola. A quadratic function. And we know if we increase it by one more

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.798
once again, we get this really cool cubic function. Now, you just saw your

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:36.520
first higher order polynomial, in the last quiz. And I think that, we should

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.800
focus on one of these in particular for right now. Let's look at the graph of y

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.986
equals x to the 5th minus x. Let's just look at the overall appearance of this

00:00:44.986 --> 00:00:48.920
function. And then build up some information about polynomial functions in

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.785
general based on that. We saw a big picture of this graph earlier showing

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.745
pretty big range on the y axis in a pretty big part of the domain on the x. But

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.535
now I've zoomed into the middle where some of the most interesting stuff is

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:04.950
happening. Remember that the ends of the graph, this way and this way, are just

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.824
sort of continuing on for a long time in the same direction. So it seems like

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:11.790
all the changes are happening in here. Because this is the only area where

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.621
things are changing, we can split the domain into sections based on what's

00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:18.710
happening in here. Now I see one change happening right around here. And

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.697
another change happening right around here. So with these lines I have

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:26.280
effectively divided the domain into three chunks. Three different intervals.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.100
Now let's label these intervals interval one, interval two, and interval three.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.600
It also seems like there are two special points. These two right here. I'll

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.644
color them in this bright blue color and label them points A and B. These are

00:01:39.644 --> 00:01:43.142
of course the points where these lines separating the parts the domain from one

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:47.858
another intersect the graph of our function. So let's talk about what the graph

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:52.290
looks like within each of these intervals and why these two points are special.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.181
Now first of all, can you tell me in which of these intervals the graph is

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:59.740
increasing? And which of them the graph is decreasing. And second which of

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.563
these two points is a relative maximum and which one is a relative minimum?
