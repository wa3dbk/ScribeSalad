00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.486
With the X axis east and the Y axis north and the Z axis up like this, that

00:00:04.486 --> 00:00:11.550
forms a right handed coordinate system. So, this is the correct answer. What's

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.700
interesting is that if you swap the latitude and longitude, and so, list the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.050
coordinates as latitude, longitude and altitude, the coordinate system is now

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.474
left handed. It also swaps if you consider west to increase the longitude or

00:00:22.474 --> 00:00:24.550
south to increase the latitude.
