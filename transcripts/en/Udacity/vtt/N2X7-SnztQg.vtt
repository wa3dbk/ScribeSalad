00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.846
The exercises you completed in this
practice session, like sorting and

00:00:03.846 --> 00:00:07.210
searching, are classic
quintessential programming problems.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.590
They require sound problem
solving skills and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.590
complex reasoning, both qualities
found in any IOS developer.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.680
So great job and
we'll see you in the next session.
