00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
[Narrator] The answer is 0.32, and we're computing this using the conditional probability rule,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that means we need the probability of A intersect B,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
divided by the probability of B.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In this case, B is the case where X is not A so that's 1 minus the probability where X is A,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which is equal to 0.92.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Since the probability that X is A is 8%.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The intersection probability is the probability that X is a vowel intersected with the probability that X is not A.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:42.000
That's the probability for all the vowels other than A, which is adding 0.13 + 0.07 + 0.07 + 0.03,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and there we get 0.30, and when we do the division, we get 0.32,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and this makes sense.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Previously, we computed the probability that X is a vowel by itself with 0.38.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If we know X is not A, we expect that probability to go down,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which is why we get the lower value 0.32 here.
