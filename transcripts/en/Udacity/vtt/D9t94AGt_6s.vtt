00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.860
Remembering that there's an invisible 1 here, as the exponent in this

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.890
expression, all of these exponents stand for the number of years that have

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.810
passed. Or another way to look at this is that it's the number of times that

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.038
interest has been added. After four years, then, we'll have 10,000 times 1.03

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:25.055
to the 4th power. After 10 years, we'll have 10,000 times 1 plus 0.03 to the

00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:29.985
10th power and after 100 years, we'll have the same thing except to the

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:36.596
hundredth power. Well, if you got all these number right, congratulations. You

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:40.850
obviously spotted the pattern and then you extended it. That is some great

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.550
detective work using math.
