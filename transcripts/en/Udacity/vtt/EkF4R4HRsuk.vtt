00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.200
So our answer to the last quiz would've been a lot easier

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.900
to read and a lot more useful if we used names to

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.290
keep track of values, instead of writing out those big numbers, especially

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.650
numbers as big as the speed of light. Python provides a way

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.530
to do it. It's called the Variable. We can use the variable

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.650
to create a name and use that name to refer to a

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.620
variable. So the way to introduce a variable is using an assignment

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.680
statement. And an assignment statement looks like this. We have a name,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.860
followed by an equal symbol, followed by an expression. After

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.660
the assignment statement, the name that was on the left side

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.190
refers to the value that the expression has. The name

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.470
can be any sequence of letters and numbers, as well as

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.850
underscores, as long as it starts with a letter or

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.785
an underscore. So here's an example, we could create the name,

00:00:44.785 --> 00:00:47.970
speed_of_light, and we can assign to it the value of the

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.078
speed of light in meters per second. So after that assignment,

00:00:51.078 --> 00:00:55.810
the name speed_of_light refers to that value. One way to

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.320
think of that is to have an arrow, so we can

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.130
have the name speed_of_light, and that's a name which refers to

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.180
a value. And the value it refers to is this long

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.190
value, which is the speed of light in meters per

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.040
second. So once we've done the assignment, we can use the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.720
name and the value of the name is the value that

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.290
it refers to. In this case it's the speed of light

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.365
in meters per second. So let's try that in the Python interpreter.

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:26.447
So here we've introduced the variable speed of light and we've assigned to it

00:01:26.447 --> 00:01:31.537
the value 299,792,458, the speed of light in meters per second.

00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:34.080
And now we've got that, assign it a variable.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.880
Instead of having to type out that whole number, we

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.850
can use it directly. When we print out the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.290
speed of light, it will be the value that that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.720
name refers to. So we'll see, instead of seeing

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.240
speed of light, we'll see the 299 million value here.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.220
We can use in expressions as well. So if we

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.510
want to convert it into centimeters instead of meters, we

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.870
can multiply by 100 and now we see the result

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.900
is the speed of light in centimeters per second. So

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.950
let's define another variable. This one will define billionth, which

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.420
means 1 divided by 1,000,000,000. That's hard enough to remember

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.980
how many zeros to type, so it's nice to

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.270
have that in a variable. And now we can define

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.700
nanostick, which is the length of Grace Hopper's nanostick,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.020
as the speed of light times a billionth. That would

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.130
be the length of the nanostick in meters. If

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.260
we want it in centimeters, we can multiply by 100.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.350
And so now we've defined a variable, nanostick, which is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.210
the length light travels in a nanosecond, in centimeters, and

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.560
we can print that out. So, variables are really useful. They're going to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.180
make our programs a lot easier to understand. They also mean that we can

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.590
use the same expression, changing the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.330
values of the variables to compute different

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.810
things. So, now it's time for a quiz to see if you understand variables.
