00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
Now I am very sure that you have figured out a pattern by now,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.860
so let's draw a really long one.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.200
Of course, I'm going to ask you the same questions,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.230
but this is the last time I'm going to ask you those two questions.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.610
So, please once more, what is length of the shortest path from A to B?

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.180
And what is the number of shortest paths from A to B?

00:00:17.180 --> 99:59:59.000
By shortest path, I mean one that visits all vertices, as in the examples before.
