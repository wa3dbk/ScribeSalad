00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.210
Before we can simulate a Turing machine,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.960
we first have to represent
it using a string.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.150
Notice that this represents
an immediate challenge.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.900
Our universal Turing machine must use
a fixed alphabet for its input and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.537
have a fixed number of states.

00:00:13.537 --> 00:00:16.856
But it must be able to simulate Turing
machines with arbitrarily larger

00:00:16.856 --> 00:00:19.028
alphabets and
an arbitrary number of states.

00:00:19.028 --> 00:00:23.014
As we'll see, one solutions is
essentially to enumerate all the symbols

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.274
and states and represent them in binary.

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.140
There are lots of ways to do this.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.871
The way we're going to do it,
is a compromise of readability and

00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:31.510
efficiency.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.426
So we'll let M be a turning machine
with states q0 through qn- 1.

00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:43.470
And we'll let it's tape alphabet
be gamma a1 through am.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.270
We'll define i and j so that 2 to the i
is at least the number of states.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.580
And 2 to the j is at least
the size of the tape alphabet.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.870
Then we can encode a state
qk as the string qw,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.600
where w is the binary
representation of k.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.708
For example,
if the number of states is 6,

00:01:05.708 --> 00:01:11.940
then we would need i to be 3, and so
we would encode q3 as the string q,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.873
and then 3 written out in binary, 011.

00:01:15.873 --> 00:01:19.278
By the way, we'll use
the convention that q followed by

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:22.620
the binary representation
of 0 is the initial state.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.620
q followed by the binary representation
of 1 is the accept state, and

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.840
q followed by the binary representation
of 2 Is the reject state.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.880
We encode symbols much in the same
way as we encoded states.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.400
We'll use a followed by w,
where w is the binary representation

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.360
of this k to indicate the kth symbol.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.340
For example,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.540
if there are 10 different symbols, then
we need 4 bits to represent them all.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.990
And we might encode a5,
which could be any symbol.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.737
Maybe it's a star.

00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:00.311
We would encode that as the string, a,

00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:04.450
followed by the binary
representation of 5, 4 plus 1 is 5.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.410
Let's see an encoding for an example.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.840
This example decides whether the input
consists of a number of zeros,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.960
that is a power of two.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.460
To encode the Turing machine as a whole,

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.280
we really just need to encode
the transition function.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.700
We'll start by considering
this edge here.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.720
We're going from state 0, so
I'll write that this way.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.160
We see the symbol 0, so I'll write
the encoding for that like so.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.520
And then we're to state 3,
so i'll write out that here.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.770
And then we need to write the $, so

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.130
i'll write out the encoding for
that, like so.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.080
And we're supposed to move to the right.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.010
So I'll write the R there.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.080
Remember that the order is input state,

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.700
input symbol, output state,
output symbol, and then direction.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.840
Next, let's do this
blue transition here.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.695
We go from state 3, and we read a 0.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.860
So I encode that that way.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.170
And then we're going to state 4.

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.212
So, I'll write the encoding for
that with q,

00:03:15.212 --> 00:03:18.255
followed by the binary
representation of 4.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.670
And we're supposed to write x.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.830
So I look up the encoding for
x, that's a10, like so.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.710
And we want to move
the head to the right.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.990
So I include an R here.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:34.470
So that's the convention we'll use to
write out the transition function.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.840
It's just a sequence of these
five tuples of this form,

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.240
input state, input symbol, output state,
output symbol and then direction.
