Well, if we want our function to decrease things by 3 then we should take our

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:10.258
input x and subtract 3 form it. So our return value or our output should be x

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:15.756
minus 3. Let's play around. If I say, I want to figure out decrease by 3 And

00:00:15.756 --> 00:00:21.626
have the input be, four, then sure enough I get one. Let's do a couple more. We

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:25.842
can see that in both of these cases, the number that is output is 3 lower than

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:29.834
the number that is input. Which is exactly what we wanted to have happen.
