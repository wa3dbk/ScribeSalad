00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've congratulated ourselves for getting this far. We've still got a ways to go.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now the question is what do we do next?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It may seem a little bit daunting, but there's so much to do, and when I get that feeling,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I remembered the book Bird by Bird by Anne Lamott, a very funny book.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In it, she relates the story of how when she was in elementary school and there was

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a big book report due where she had to write up descriptions of multiple different birds.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And she was behind and it was due soon, and she went to her father and complained,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"How am I ever gonna get done. I'm behind," and her father just told her, "Bird by bird."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
"Just go and take the first bird, write up a report on that, and then

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
take the next bird off the list and keep continuing until you're done."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's go bird-by-bird and finish this up. What do we have left to do?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well, we got to figure out how to put letters on one particular row while dealing with the crosswords,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
then we got to expand from that to all the rows and then we got to do the columns as well,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and then we got to worry about the scoring.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
There was a couple of minor things to be put off like dealing with the blanks.

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That's a lot to do, and let's go bird-by-bird .
