00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So next, we're going to extend this idea of finding a path from V₁ to V₂

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
to the idea of finding a shortest path from V₁ to all other nodes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And one of the reasons we want to do that is to identify central node in a social network.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Nodes that are likely to have a lot of influence, or well-placed, or very well-connected,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and so we're going to look now at the question of given a node V₁, how central is it?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, it turns out there's lots of different ways that you can define what central means.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We're going to write now focus on a particular one

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which is the average shortest path length to all the other nodes.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So to find this quantity, we're going to need to calculate

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the shortest path length from V₁ to all the other nodes.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now, based on the analysis we've done so far, finding the shortest path length

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
from some node V₁ to some other specific node V₂, takes time Θ(n+m), nodes plus edges.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So, following sort of a naive kind of algorithm design, well, this should work and it's not so terrible.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's to say, well, if we want to know the shortest distance from V₁

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to each of the other nodes in the graph, we can just repeat this process

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
once for each possible target node.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, we find the shortest path from V₁ to V₂ and from V₁ to V₃ and V₁ to V₄ and V₁ to V₅

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and we can get all these distances and then say average them to get this measure of centrality.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
The running time for that approach is going to be big Θ of n, the number of nodes

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
times the time that it takes to do a shortest path search.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So, it's really n times n plus m which is (n²+nm).

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now, the superhero data that we're looking at the moment has only order of 6000 superhero nodes

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and 6000² is, you know, a substantial number and we'll be nice to avoid this if we could.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, here are some choices for you, one possibility is you can't, just deal with it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and this is the fastest way to do it which is essentially to repeat

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
individual pair y searches until you've exhausted all the nodes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Another possibility is well you can make it faster by just using a smaller graph.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Another choice would be while you're searching for V₁, when not sure what to search for,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
just search for something that's not anywhere in the graph,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and last choice is, actually, you can speed things up by doing the search backwards.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Now, actually all these choices sound kind of weird, don't they?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
But the right one is this third one here and the reason that this actually works,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is if you search using the algorithm that we've been looking at,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
if you search from V₁ for something that's not in the graph at all,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
what is going to do it's just going to keep searching and searching and searching and searching

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and building shortest paths to all the nodes it encounters along the way

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
until it discovers that the node that it's looking for just isn't there.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
At the end of that process, every single node in the graph will have a shortest path

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
from the--will be notated, annotated with the shortest path from V₁ to that node.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So, the running time here is just the time it takes to do a single search,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Θ(n+m) and then you get the answer for all the nodes in the graph.
