00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.590
To code this in Bluejay, we'll start creating that int i, which was starting at

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:12.980
zero. Now, while i is a valid index, so it's less than the size of friends,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.650
we either remove the i'th friend or increment

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.280
i. So, if the condition holds, then we

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040
remove the i'th friend. Otherwise we increment I.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.260
And the condition is the same one that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.444
we saw in that buggy version. We get the i'th friend and then try

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:34.430
to find this person in the i'th friend's friend list. And if the index

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.970
of this person is negative one, then we know that the friendship isn't mutual

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.110
and we should remove that friend. Now

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.980
let's test it. Looks like our expectations match.
