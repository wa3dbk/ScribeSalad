00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.410
So the answer is all of the code fragments

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.110
except for the third one, except for this one,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.820
leave the value P unchanged. So let's work through

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.480
why that is. We're not going to assume anything about P.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.600
It's, list with atleast two elements. So I'll draw

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.520
P. We can't make any assumptions about what the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.480
elements are. We'll call them Alpha, Beta and Gamma.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.110
Actually, it looks like alpha, beta, and alpha. That's okay.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.790
So let's look at the first option. Here's what

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.630
happens. We append a 3 to P. That adds a

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.330
new element at the end of P. And then we

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.050
pop. That removes it. We don't do anything with the

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.530
result returned by pop, but that's okay. The value of

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.640
p is unchanged. For this choice, we start by popping.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.070
That will remove an element from p, so now x

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.210
will refer to whatever this element was. So x refers

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.960
to alpha in this case, and p is mutated by

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.870
mod, removing that element. So at this stage, the value

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.720
of p has changed, but we're not done. We still

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.140
have the append to do. The append appends to p,

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.260
adding onto the end of p the value that x

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.810
refers to, which is the alpha value that was in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140
that position to begin with. So at the end of

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.390
these two steps, the value of p is also unchanged.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.200
Let's look at the third option and see why that does affect the value of p.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.080
So the first statement, we assign to x

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.300
the result of p.pop(). That will remove the last

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.810
element from p and make x refer to it's value. So now whatever value was at ten

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.210
of p the name x refers to. Then we do another pop. So now after this pop,

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.810
y will refer to the value here, which is beta. We remove that value from p. So

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.920
at this state p has lost two elements, but

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.240
we've stored them in the variable x and y.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.390
Then we do the append, and we're doing the appends in the same order we did the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.350
pops. So we're appending x first. The value of

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.790
x is alpha, so this will Add the alpha

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.250
to p. Note that that's not what we started with.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.490
We started with the beta there. Then we do the next

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.910
append. That will add the value of y, which is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.150
beta to p. If we pop elements of p, and we

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.210
add them in the same order that we pop them,

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.900
this will actually reverse the order of the elements, since each

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.560
time we append, we add to the end of the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.730
list. So for the final choice, we're again popping two elements.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.560
This time we're appending in the opposite order, that

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.810
means when we do their appends so the value

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.320
when we popped x, that got the value alpha.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.630
When we popped y, y was the value beta.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.260
P lost these two elements as the result of

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.890
the two pops. Now we're here. We do the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.150
appends. And this time, we're appending y first. Well,

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.240
that's the beta, that's the last one we popped,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480
the first one we append. This gets the

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.205
elements in the order they were before. And finally,

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:10.470
we append x, which is the alpha. This restores

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.540
the value of p to what we started with.
