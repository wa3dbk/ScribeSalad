00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.922
Now we're going to do
something really cool.

00:00:01.922 --> 00:00:06.780
I'm going to show you how to build
a parameterized model from data.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.350
What do I mean by parameterized model?

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.593
This is an example of a parameterized
model that you're probably familiar with

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:14.426
from algebra.

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:21.556
It's a function of x and
it has these two parameters, m and b.

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:26.490
In fact, as you're probably aware,
this is the equation of a line.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.890
So m and
b are the parameters of that line.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.554
Now for convenience in our
code instead of using m and

00:00:36.554 --> 00:00:42.490
b, I'm going to use C0 and
C1, just to be consistent.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.870
Let me motivate this with an example.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680
Let's suppose we have some
data from an experiment.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.190
Now this can work for
many sorts of experiments, but for now,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.810
let's assume we've taken some
measurements of humidity, and we've

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.650
observed on those particular days we
measured the humidity how much it rains.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.130
So each dot here represents one day and
one sample of data.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.325
So on this date, it was this humid,
and it rained that much.

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:15.480
Now we probably have lots more data,
one for each day.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.490
When we look at this data, we see
there's a kind of relationship here.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.900
And our intuition is maybe that
it could be fitted by a line.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.550
Just sort of by eyeballing it,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.430
looks like the line might look about
like that, and so our parameters here

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.938
coefficient 0 is equivalent
to the slope here,

00:01:36.938 --> 00:01:42.100
and coefficient 1 is the y intercept.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.040
So our task is to find C sub 0 and

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.650
C sub 1 that provide the equation for
this line that best fits the data.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.646
The question here is,
how do we reframe this problem so

00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:02.239
that it makes sense for our minimizer?

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:06.464
What is it we're trying to minimize?

00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:12.340
So restating the problem, suppose we
have our original data points here, and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.140
we're trying to discover the equation
of a line that best fits those points.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.170
Suppose this blue line is a candidate
line and we want to evaluate it.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.230
Is this good or bad?

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.414
So the equation for that line is,

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:34.260
our first coefficient times x
plus the second coefficient.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.690
And what the minimizer is going to
do is it's going to vary this C0 and

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.250
C1 to try and minimize something.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.350
And so
we have to come up with an equation that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.539
gets lower in value as this
line better fits the data.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.420
What should we use for that equation?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.990
So here's one step towards
solving this problem.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.530
We can take a look at each one
of our original data points and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.270
observe how far away it is from
this line that we're evaluating.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.240
Let's call each of these distances e.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.790
So e sub 0 is that one,
e sub 1 is that one.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.980
Can we come up with
an equation in terms of e or

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.420
error that gets us to this solution?
