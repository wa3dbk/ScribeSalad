There's some things that can promote regular sleep habits. But before I get

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:07.213
into them, I want you to look at the lists I'm about to show you. And tell me

00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:10.977
what you think is good for sleep and what you think is bad for sleep. If you go

00:00:10.977 --> 00:00:15.212
to bed at the same time each night, is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If

00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:20.715
you excercise right before bed, is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If you

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:25.299
eat a big meal right before bed. Is that good for sleep or bad for sleep? If

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:29.701
you turn off your TV, computer, cell phone or any gadget before bed, is that

00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:35.632
good for sleep or bad for sleep? Fill in the blank with either the word good or

00:00:35.632 --> 00:00:36.599
bad.
