00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.000
A final problem I want to mention can be called the Traceability Problem.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.360
The code of the program that uses a design pattern does not

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.050
necessarily make explicit that you're actually using the pattern.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.160
You don't have to use the names of the classes taken from the book.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.050
And, as you saw, there were lots of options with respect to implementation.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.040
Consequently, somebody reading the code may not realize you're using a pattern.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.690
Therefore, there's an extra obligation on you as a developer for documenting and

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.009
using certain naming conventions, so it's obvious what's going on.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.340
If you're not careful, this can lead to increased the failure to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.600
do this documentation can lead to increased fragmentation of the code,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.880
having to do with the additional classes and methods which patterns introduce.
