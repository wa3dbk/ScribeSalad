00:00:05.075 --> 00:00:10.354
less than 10000. We have that Grant wants to spend under $10,000, so he wants

00:00:10.354 --> 00:00:15.765
his budget to be something less than this. Not anything greater than 10000 and

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:20.986
not even anything equal to 10000. This last answer right here, that nozzle

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:23.080
budget is not equal to 10000.
