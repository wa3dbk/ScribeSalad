00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.690
Pyretic enables the notion of both sequential and

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.670
parallel composition as we've discussed in previous lessons.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.350
For example, we could match all packets for

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.760
a particular destination IP address and send them or

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.400
forward them out a particular output port. The

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.200
double greater than sign shown here Is the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.060
way of expressing sequential composition in Pyretic. Parallel

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.350
composition allows two policies to be applied in parallel.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.380
In this example, we match on a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.340
particular destination IP address and subsequently forward the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.270
traffic out Output Port one. In Parallel,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.000
we apply a different set of policies that

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.860
match on a different source IP address.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.830
An output the packets on a different output

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.590
port. In Pyretic, the plus operator performs

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.480
parallel composition of policies. Pyretic allows an operator,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.530
to construct queries, which allow the program

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.380
to see packet streams. For example, the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.280
packets query allows the operator to see

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.500
packets, arriving at a particular switch with

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.520
a particular source MAC address. The one

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.710
parameter here indicates that we only want

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.530
to see the first packet that arrives

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.230
with a unique source MAC address and switch.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.250
We can then register callbacks for these packet streams. That are

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.600
invoked to handle each new packet that arrives for that query.
