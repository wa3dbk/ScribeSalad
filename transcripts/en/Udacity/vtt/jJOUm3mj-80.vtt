00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.750
What do you think, David,
does it make sense to you?

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; So, to me this story does make sense.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.750
I can imagine it as a story where
Ali and Sarah are co-workers and

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.240
Sarah has some kind of
authority over Ali.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.750
Ali is looking around the store and
saying that there aren't that many

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.640
customers right now, so
maybe now is a good time take my lunch.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.380
But if there's about to
be a rush of customers,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.250
then now is not a good time because
leaves Sarah there by herself.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.310
So Ali asks Sarah,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.780
do you think there are going to be
many customers in the next half-hour?

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.680
Sarah knows that it's around lunch time
and Sarah recalls maybe that Ali had

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.700
commented about missing
breakfast this morning.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.650
So, she can infer Ali's motivation
behind asking if there's going to

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.670
be many customers, and she says, kind
of anticipates the question he really

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.970
was asking and says,
yeah go ahead and take your lunch.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.600
So, yeah, I can find a way for
this story to make sense,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.140
even though it doesn't seem like a clear
connection between the two sentences.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.900
&gt;&gt; That's good David.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.440
Clearly you have an active imagination.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.470
Notice how David introduced
lots of inferences here

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.640
which were not really part of the input.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.250
How did he do it?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.640
This is common sense reasoning.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840
How did he infer that it's probably
lunchtime and that Ali wants to have

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.920
lunch or that Sarah has some
kind of authority over Ali?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.980
We have come across
stories like this earlier.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.340
Here is another example.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.340
Ashok wanted to become rich,
he got a gun.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.670
Two sentences and you can, I'm sure,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.510
understand immediately
what might be going on.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.330
You may surmise that Ashok,
as a professor,

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.440
is unlikely to become rich, even if he
teaches this online Master's course.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.010
On the other hand,

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.030
you may have some stereotypical story
about how some people become rich.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.680
Well, there are banks, and
robbing a bank may require guns.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.420
And so now you can relate Ashok getting
a gun to trying to become rich.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.020
So you and I, as human beings,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.160
have little difficulty in
understanding stories like this.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.970
You might be given two
sentences like this and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.715
we can connect them, causally connect
them, coherently connect them,

00:01:42.715 --> 00:01:46.860
even if sometimes we use very
active imaginations to do so.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.940
How can we do this conjoining of
sentences into a coherent story?

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.070
Put another way,
how can we make AI agent do it?

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.545
What kind of knowledge should the AI
agent have and what kind of inferences

00:01:57.545 --> 00:02:00.530
must it make in order to be able
to connect these two sentences?
