00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.180
Let's talk about the generate method,
and like I said, we're going to

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.650
be given some training leg, examples and
we want to predict the labels, okay?

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.580
I need a little bit of an invitation
because we're going to do a trivial

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.810
amount of math.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.805
This little notation,

00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:17.500
4 to 9 means an object is really
a four but I call it a 9.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.750
We're going to talk about the costs or
the loss,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.220
you're going to see L for
loss, you know,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.100
what's the, the cost to me of
calling a 4 a 9 or calling a 9 a 4?

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.630
All right?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.490
And one of the things we're going to
assume for the rest of today, and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.400
it's really not a big deal,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.220
you can factor we're going to assume the
cost of calling an X an X is zero, okay?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.000
So nobody gets upset if I call
a spade a spade, so to speak.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.760
So, let's consider the two class
binary classification problem.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.680
Remember we just had 4s and 9s.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.970
So we have two kinds of losses,
all right?

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.770
So that's what this L means.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.670
An L of 4 9 is the loss of
classifying a 4 as a 9.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.410
And conversely, L of 9 to 4 is
the loss of classifying a 9 as a 4.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.310
Okay?
Pretty straightforward.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.700
Risk is your expected cost, okay?

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.810
So, if I've got a particular strategy,
S, classifier strategy S.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.790
We want to talk about what's
the expected loss, all right?

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.120
And for our 4 and 9 example,
the risk of our strategy

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.950
is, what's the probability
that I'll call a 4 a 9.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.645
And how often is that going to happen?

00:01:31.645 --> 00:01:32.900
Okay.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.560
Using this particular strategy, and
I multiply that by whatever the loss is,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.600
the cost of calling a 4 9,
and what's the probability

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.882
of calling a 9 a 4 and
what's the loss when I call a 9 or 4?

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:48.450
All right?

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.250
And that's the risk because
the probability is, you know,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.725
15% of the time that I'm running
this thing, 15% of the times,

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:58.230
I'm going to 4 is going to come up and
I'm going to call it a 9.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.050
Okay, that's what probability
of calling a 4 9 means.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.310
So this total quantity,
that's what's referred to as your risk.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.139
And remember what we want to do is we
want to minimize the expected risk.
