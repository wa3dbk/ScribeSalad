00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, that's actually something we can easily compute.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The product of these two is 4 minus the product of these two.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is zero so we have 4 minus 0, which is 4.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The square root down here is the product

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of all the individual row and column sums.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So this is 2 x 2 x 2 x 2, which is 16.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The square root of 16 is also 4.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we have value of 4 up here,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
value of zero down here,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
value of 4 down here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Four minus zero divided by 4 is precisely 1,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which means that we do have a strong correlation between

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
failure and coverage.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Here we have the product of the first diagonal

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
minus the product of the second diagonal,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and here we have the square root over the product

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
of the individual sums of the rows and columns.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Let's fill the appropriate values of our table and compute the Phi coefficient.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We click on run, and we get 1.0.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Always nice to see that the computer confirms what we already had thought.
