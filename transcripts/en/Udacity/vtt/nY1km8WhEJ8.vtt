00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.240
Here's a more challenging problem. For this one, I'm going to draw in the boxes,

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.541
and I want you to fill them in for completing the long division process. Here

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:12.619
are the boxes that you can fill in for the long division. You want to make sure

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:16.338
that you put the original product, once you multiply this term, by 3x and

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:20.512
negative 2. Also include the appropriate sign in the box. If it's positive,

00:00:20.512 --> 00:00:23.485
don't put a sign, but if it's negative, do include it.
