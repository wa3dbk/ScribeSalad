00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:07.032
Here we have two pretty simple exponential functions. Two to the power of X and three to the power of X.

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:15.366
Two to the power of zero is one; three to the power of zero is one; two to the power of one is two.

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:23.766
Two to the power of two is four. Two to the power of minus one equals one over two, one half, and so on.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:30.766
Three to the power of one equals three. Three to the power of two gets pretty big--nine.

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:37.199
Three to the power of minus one, one over three, one-third, and so on, and so on.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.066
Here comes a quiz for you: What's the slope of the tangent line at X equals zero?

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:50.466
Is the slope larger than one? Is it equal to one, or is it smaller than one?

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:54.967
In both cases, look at the tangent lines--what would you say?
