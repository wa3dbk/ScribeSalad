Although what we just looked at is, looks like a programming language,

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.905
syntax, text and so on, if you use ACME, you'll likely to use it through

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:15.040
its graphical editor, in which case, you can draw all of what's going on.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.510
Here is a screenshot from, the ACME studio tool.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.260
It, it contains two rectangles which correspond to the components and

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.640
one circle which corresponds to the connector, and you can see that the two

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.450
components are both plugged into the connector and hence, can communicate with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.250
each other. If you build your description using the graphical editor,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.920
you can then generate the code we've just seen in the textual form.
