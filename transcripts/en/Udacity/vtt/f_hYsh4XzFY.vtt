00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.730
So let's take a look at the code at this new method, greetByPeriod to

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.039
application. So, here I'm in Hello world

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:12.760
and poin.java, I've defined my new function greetByPeriod.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.161
Still got the name argument, and it's

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:18.990
got a named period argument, period. And just

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.570
for variety, although the name is @Named

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.080
period. I'm calling the argument time of day,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.900
just to show that whatever the @Named is what is required to be specified

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.400
in the request. And I'm all doing here is returning new HelloClass name, time of

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.910
day. HelloClass class, didn't actually have this

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.790
constructor, so I added it, it's pretty

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.400
simple. Here's the new construction HelloClass. Pass

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.000
the name, the period, construct a new message,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.520
good, this would be morning, let's say, good morning

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.720
Lauren. Good morning Lauren. Okay, so let's see if it

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.380
works. I'm going to run it on the dev

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.150
server, save my changes, it's always a good thing to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.290
do. Mkay, let's go over to the local host

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.500
in the browser. And I'm going to go straight to

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.960
the API's explorer. Oh goodness, got an error, that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.082
never happens. Failed to retrieve API configs with status: 500.

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:20.500
All right, first instinct panic, second instinct go

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.360
back and check the code. And you see I

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.570
got the error showing up here too, Failed

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.950
to retrieve API configs. That means there is something

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.320
wrong with my end point function. Let's look

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.040
at hello world end points greetByPeriod all looks good,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.880
what's the problem? Aha, it's a copy and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.270
paste error. See here, I copy and pasted this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.130
from the previous method sayHelloByName. And I

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.140
forgot to update the function name. So I'll

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.070
just fix that real quick. You can't have

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.090
two functions exposed with the same name. Actually

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.870
greet by period. Save it. And actually when you make changes in the Java code

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
and you save it. You'll usually find that

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.820
the changes get automatically propagated out to localhost.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.360
See it says, reloading the web application, a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.040
file has changed. So I don't need to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.070
run it again. I'll just go straight to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.870
local host, reload the APIs Explorer. Okay good.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.550
This time it worked. Now drill down into my API. Here's my new one, greet by

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.000
period. Enter a name. And it's the afternoon

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.430
now. And then let's look at the response.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.677
There it is. Good afternoon. And then Good afternoon Buttercup, because

00:02:37.677 --> 00:02:42.398
Buttercup's the name I gave. So one other thing to look at is the code for

00:02:42.398 --> 00:02:48.129
index.html and hello.js. Take a quick look

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.918
at those, index.html. Really what we had to do was add the,

00:02:53.918 --> 00:02:59.260
the new imput field for period is called Period_Field and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.860
the new button for the greeting and in Hello.js.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.520
And enable buttons that we needed to enable to

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.420
function for the new button. Here's the new button,

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.460
input greetByPeriod. We're going to call the function greetByPeriod. We're going

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.073
to update the button label. Now we have to

00:03:17.073 --> 00:03:19.408
define greet by period and here it is, it's

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.654
very similar to greet by name. But we get

00:03:21.654 --> 00:03:24.328
the name field, we get the value of the name

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:26.407
out of the HTML, we get the period

00:03:26.407 --> 00:03:29.650
out of the period field element. You construct

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.640
the request. And here we're calling the greetByPeriod

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.810
function. And then we're specifying the argument. The

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.920
arguments are name and period. Now because we've

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.620
called the period, we've named the period argument,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.527
at period. This must exactly match. And then

00:03:46.527 --> 00:03:50.133
we execute it and we call the sayHelloCallBack

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:54.330
as before. And again, it throws up an alert dialog box showing

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.300
us the message in the response. So, that's all there is to it.
