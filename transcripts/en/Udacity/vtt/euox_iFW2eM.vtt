00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hey, guys--so today we're going to

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
go over how to install Python

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and then install Google App Engine

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that you can get going on the homework.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's really the main point of this homework--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to get you up and running, so that--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for the rest of the homeworks--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you actually have a good handle

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on how to start, and we can just go over

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
how to actually start building some Real World Web Applications.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So okay--let's start out.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So here, I'm at: www.python.org.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Go ahead and go there, and then you'll get this link

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and go down to: download Python now.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The good thing is that if you're on Mac or Linux,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
then you probably already have Python installed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You shouldn't need to get anything.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you do, then you can go ahead and install it from here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So down here what you want to click on is--

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
if you're installing Windows, then either a 64-bit system, down here, or 32-bit--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
you simply click on there and install it like you would normally on a Windows system.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Same thing with the Mac system.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
On Linux, you can install a source tarbal--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but, honestly, you probably already have it,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and there's an easier way to do that with your package manager.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll have a list of instructions for some of the more common

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
package managers for Linux up in the forums.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we're not going to go over that right now.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But go ahead and open it, for example--right there--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and then install it as you normally would.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And after that--once we have Python installed,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
we have everything we need for Google App Engine.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So let's go ahead and install that.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, Google App Engine is right here.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you don't want to type all of this in,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
just Google App Engine and it should be the first option

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
on the search results page.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So before we go ahead and sign up,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we're going to install the software development environment

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and it's pretty easy to use, for the most part.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So we're going to go over here to Downloads.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We're going to want the Python Version of it,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
so either the Windows, the Mac or the Linux--

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
depending on what platform you're on.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Don't worry about the MapReduce Bundle.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That's not something we need to worry about right now.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So go ahead and open up whichever one is appropriate for your system.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
All of them are super simple to install.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Once you've got it installed,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we're going to open up Google App Engine

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and it opens into this screen right here, okay?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now what we need to do is open up a new application.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So go to File&gt;New Application,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and then that should open up this, right here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We'll go ahead and install it under, let's say: hello-udacity.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Great. And there we go.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Okay. So there are a couple things to look at.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now we can open up the files

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that this automatically creates.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So go to the Path, which you see right here,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and there's really only 1 file you need to worry about--

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and that's: main.pi.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
There are a few other files in that directory.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We're not going to worry about them right now.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We'll explain it later.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
There's not much to it, really.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Here's your main file for your Web application: hello-udacity.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So open main.pi, and it's really a pretty short file.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And now you change this to print out: hello-udacity.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We can run this.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You see that it's running on Port 8081.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Steve talked about Ports early in the course.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So what we're going to do

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
is open up localhost.8081--

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and you see: Hello world!

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Now, you're going to have to change this

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to print out: hello-udacity.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But the hard part--the part we're really interested in--

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
is actually installing this so you're ready for other homework assignments later on,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
when we're building--well, some Web applications with some actual content.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now we've got it running on our local system.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
But, obviously--well, hopefully,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
we can't see your local system.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So we need to actually sign up for Google App Engine.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So let's go back to the main page that we were at before,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
sign up for an account with them--it's very simple,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and once you have all of your information there,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
then all you have to do to put this up online

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is deploy it to your account and password,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
sign in, and it will automatically load all these things.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And then, once you're done,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you should be able to go to the Google App Engine Web site

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and check out your Web app.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now, I haven't loaded this on yet,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but once you do, you should get the same results from there

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that you do from your local host.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And that's about it.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
All you have to do is change this to: hello-udacity

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and then load up the URL,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
whatever this happens to be--

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
this is hello-udacity in mine;

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
in yours, it would be whatever this is--

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and put that in for the homework assignment,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and you should be good to go!
