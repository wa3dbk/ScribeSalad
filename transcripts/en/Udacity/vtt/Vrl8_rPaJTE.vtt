00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.598
We've seen parallel lines. Now, let's check out perpendicular lines. Here are 2

00:00:04.598 --> 00:00:09.082
lines that are perpendicular. Before we talk about perpendicular lines, I want

00:00:09.082 --> 00:00:13.533
to see if you can find these equations. Use the graph to write the equations in

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:18.098
slope intercept form. For this line, write the answer here. And for this line,

00:00:18.098 --> 00:00:18.962
write it here.
