00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.293
In the last quiz, we narrowed down the interval in which zero lies to be

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:09.556
between 1.5 and 2. To narrow this down even further, first, test the value of

00:00:09.556 --> 00:00:15.182
the function when x equals 1.7. Then, determine whether the zero is going to

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:21.580
lie in the interval from 1.5 to 1.7 or from 1.7 to 2. Remember that the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.133
function is negative when x equals 1.5, and it's positive when x equals 2.
