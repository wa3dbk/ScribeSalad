00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.980
So far we've learned that a linear
layout can have a vertical orientation,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.140
or a horizontal orientation.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.380
We've also learned that individual
views can have weight values

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.350
to fill up the extra
space in the parent.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.520
Now we;re going to spend
some time learning about

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.450
the relative layout view group.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.910
This will help you build
even more flexible layouts.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.140
Do remember Ray the relative layout.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.590
He's the dad, and he's represented
by this view group here.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.250
He helps the children views,
be positioned within this container.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.360
With the relative layout,
you can position children relative to

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.840
the parent, such as the top of
the parent or the bottom of the parent.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.680
The other option is to position children
views relative to other children.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.920
Like this.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.520
Let's focus first on the case where
views can be positioned relative to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.780
the parent.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.220
For this example, this parent relative
that is set to have with a batch parent,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.550
and height of match parent,
so it's as big as the device.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.660
The children inside a relative layout,
can be positioned

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.880
relative to the parent's left,
top, right or bottom edges.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.519
This is the code for it,
on the child view x amount elements.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.540
For example for the emoji or TextView,
you would add these attributes.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.440
The attribute name follows this
format android:layout_alignParentTop.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.120
This attribute determines
whether the Child view

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.400
is align to the parents top edge or not.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.640
So the possible values are true or
false.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.780
If it's true, then the view should
be aligned to the parent's top edge.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.540
If it's false,
then it shouldn't be aligned.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.990
There are attributes for
all the other edges as well.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.800
For example alignParentBottom, for
aligning to the parent's bottom edge.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.460
There's align parent left, for
aligning to the parent's left edge.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.000
And then there's align parent right, for
aligning to the parent's right edge.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.970
You can mix and match, and use multiple
of these attributes at a time.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.680
Take this image view as an example.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.370
We would set the attribute
align parent top to be true,

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.850
because it's aligned to
the parent's top edge.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.510
It's also aligned to the parent's
left and right edges.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.220
So we set left to be true,
and right to be true as well.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.896
It's not aligned to the parent's bottom
edge, so we set that to be false.

00:02:04.896 --> 00:02:08.410
And so the this text view down here,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.430
it's aligned to parent's bottom edge,
right edge and left edge.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.910
So alignParentBottom would be true,
alignParentLeft would be true,

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.809
alignParentRight would be true,
but alignParentTop would be false.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.640
In addition to positioning
a child at the top portion, or

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.440
the bottom portion of the screen,
you can also do specific corners.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.850
If we want to position the birthday
text view in the top left corner,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.190
we say align parent top to be true, and
then align parent left to also be true.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.560
To position a view in
the top right corner,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.450
we want to align it to the parent's
top edge and right edges.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.280
So align parent top equals true,
and align parent right equals true.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.850
For the bottom left corner, we're
aligned to the parent's left edge and

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.430
bottom edge.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.490
So we say align parent
bottom equals true.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.210
True, and
a line parent left equals true.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.480
These values are false, and
they're false by default, so

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.240
you don't need to include
them in the XML code.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.170
And then for the very last corner, it's
aligned to the parent's right edge and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.030
bottom edge.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.940
So align parent bottom and
align parent right are equal to true.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.210
The other two are false.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.180
So we can leave them out of the code.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.140
Believe it or not there's even more
attributes that you could set.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.190
You can also center
the view horizontally, so

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.030
you said, android layout under
score horizontal to be true.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.530
And you can also add it to the existing
attributes we learned before.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.550
So if this is a line to the bottom,
and it's centered horizontally,

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.220
it would look like this.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.870
The last one I'm going to show
you is layout_centerVertical.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.445
If this is set to true, then it centers
the view vertically within the parent.

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:43.015
The reason why this TextView is aligned
to the left edge of the parent, even if

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:47.085
we didn't set this value, is because all
views that are added to the relative

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:51.550
layout, are positioned by default in
the top left corner of the view group.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.300
All of these attributes are called
view group layout parameters.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.100
Even though they're declared
on the child XML elements,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.440
they're used by the parent view group
to know how to position the children.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.098
Thus, they all start
with layout underscore.

00:04:05.098 --> 00:04:08.050
This also follows the pattern
of layout underscore width, and

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.960
layout underscore height,
which you are already familiar with.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.810
Those two attributes are also view group
layout perimeters, because they are used

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.920
by the view group parent, in order
to position and size the children.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.089
And here's the XML for
relative layout and its children.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:24.450
You can follow along in the link below.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.110
We have an opening relative layout tag,
and we have a closing tag at the bottom

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.740
here, and
all the children are in between.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.250
The width and

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.490
height of the RelativeLayout
is set to be match_parent.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.620
Since this is the layout for

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.070
our whole app,
it's going to take up the whole screen.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.310
There are three child texts
used inside the RelativeLayout.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.380
The first one is a TextView
that says Happy.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.090
The width and height are wrap_content,
and we have these additional attributes

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.520
to help the relative layout, know where
to position this child text view.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.060
We tell it to align it to
the parent's right edge, and

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.290
to align to the parent's top edge.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.900
So that puts the happy text view in
the top right corner of the screen.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.670
For the birthday text view, the width
and height are also wrap content.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.100
Then we want it to align to
the parent's bottom and left edges.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.750
So the bottom and left edges
leads to this corner down here.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.690
This last text view that says,
To You, doesn't have any specific

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.750
attributes specifying where
it is relative to the parent.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.410
All we know is that the width and
height should be wrap content.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.703
As I mentioned earlier, if you don't
specify where a child view should go,

00:05:25.703 --> 00:05:29.267
by default, the relative will add it
to the top left corner of the screen.
