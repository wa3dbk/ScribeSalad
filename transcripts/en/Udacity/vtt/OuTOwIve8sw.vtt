00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
In the case of multiplying a binomial by a trinomial, we just want to add some

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.310
rectangles so we can complete our multiplication. Just like with these numbers,

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.031
I'm going to set up a rectangle, and then I'm going to label each factor along

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:16.020
the side of the rectangle. This one will be x plus 3, and this one will be x

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.262
squared plus 2x plus 3. Using what you know about multiplication, I want you to

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:23.835
figure out the area of each of these rectangles. What would they be?
