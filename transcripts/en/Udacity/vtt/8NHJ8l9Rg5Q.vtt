I know these problems are difficult, and
they take a lot of practice. Remember you

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.570
can always go back and review the lessons
if you need some help. The answer to this

00:00:08.582 --> 00:00:12.301
problem is negative 28. Let's see how we
got that. The first thing I notice when

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:16.331
I'm looking at this problem is that
there's this inner parenthesis inside the

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:21.039
absolute value. So we have to perform the
operations inside the parenthesis. Before

00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:25.830
we do anything else. When I'm looking at
the operations inside these parentheses I

00:00:25.842 --> 00:00:30.660
notice that there's an exponent, and we
need to do exponents before multiplication

00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:34.978
and before subtraction. So let's do 5
squared. Remember when you're doing

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.525
problems like this you should always copy
The operations that you didn't perform,

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:43.660
and only perform one or two operations at
each step, so I'm going to copy everything

00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:47.575
down. The only think I'm going to do right
here is evaluate this 5 squared, and I

00:00:47.587 --> 00:00:51.630
know that 5 squared is 25. The next think
I can do is evaluate multiplication and

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:55.970
division. There's only one multiplication
inside the parentheses, so let's evaluate

00:00:55.982 --> 00:01:00.285
that and copy everything else down. 4
times 6 is 24 minus 25, and I have to cube

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:06.031
that, and I still have my absolute value.
Since there's one more operation inside

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:12.057
these inner parentheses, I have to do this
operation before I can do anything else. I

00:01:12.163 --> 00:01:17.062
remember to copy everything else down. 24
minus 25 gives me negative 1, and I have

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:21.947
to raise negative 1 to the third power.
Now I can perform the operations inside

00:01:21.959 --> 00:01:27.231
the absolute value and I can evaluate my
exponents first. So I have the negative

00:01:27.243 --> 00:01:32.072
absolute value of 3 cubed is 3 times 3
times 3, which is 27. And then we have

00:01:32.084 --> 00:01:37.084
negative 1 cubed which is negative 1,
times negative 1, times negative 1, which

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:42.357
is negative 1. Or you could also remember
that a negative number raised to an odd

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.819
power would give me a negative result. Now
we only have one operation left inside of

00:01:47.831 --> 00:01:52.428
the absolute value, which is 27 minus
negative 1. So I have negative the

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.927
absolute value of 27 minus a negative 1,
which is 28. From he re, remember that

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.443
this negative out front actually means
negative 1 times, and the absolute value

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:07.879
of 28 is 28. So, I have negative 1 times
28, which gives me negative 28. These were

00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:13.427
some good practice problems for both
absolute value and order of operations.

00:02:13.546 --> 00:02:15.759
Why don't you try a couple more?
