00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.840
Well that was inputs, now let's look at outputs.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.300
In particular the outputs produced by the concrete operations along with any

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.990
changes made to class attributes and

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.970
other side effects must satisfy the abstract specification.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.710
Among other things this says the answers that your implementation give

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.450
had better satisfy what is required by the specification.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.600
Stated in logic.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.630
If we have some concrete state t, and the invariant is true, and

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.530
the preconditions are, the concrete preconditions are true,

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.860
and the, after executing the operation the concrete post conditions are true,

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.850
then it better be the case that the abstract post conditions are true.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.250
Parsing this one step by step like we did for the inputs.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.680
Valid concrete states as the part that says that for

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.480
all t element of the set of concrete states, capital T would be invariant.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.630
The concrete invariant must hold on that state.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.240
And the concrete preconditions are satisfied, and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.310
that's the Pre-Q sub i on t and whatever arguments we have.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.220
And running the country operation satisfies the concrete post conditions.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.090
That's the phrase with post Qi on a concrete state.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.530
The arguments, the resulting concrete state T apostrophe, and

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.480
whatever results are produced.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.610
Then the post condition had better map to the stated abstract post condition,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.840
the last part of our post logic.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.200
Which say's the post condition on the abstract operation Pi,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.390
with the retrieve state, the arguments, the retrieved version of

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.600
the resultant state, and the results produced had better hold.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.520
Note that as you might expect, the implement, the implementation can do

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.240
more than what the spec says as long as it does at least what the spec says.
