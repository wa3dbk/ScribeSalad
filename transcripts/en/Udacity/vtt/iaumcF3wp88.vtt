00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.440
So what I just showed you is
the basic Lukas-Kanade method.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.210
kind of elegant.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.570
Basically, we've made
a lot of assumptions, and

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.610
these assumptions can give us errors.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.110
The biggest error we have, that is
the assumption that we made that's,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.680
in some sense, the most wrong,
is the idea that the motion is small.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.530
Okay?

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.156
Often, motion is large.

00:00:20.156 --> 00:00:21.633
And when motion is large,

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:24.798
a couple of things are wrong
with the Taylor expansion.

00:00:24.798 --> 00:00:30.498
One is even if things are nice and
smooth, they may not be linear.

00:00:30.498 --> 00:00:33.516
So we were doing a first order,
Taylor expansion, not a second order.

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:34.660
No second derivatives here.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.180
So that assumes that things are planar.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.825
Well, suppose things
are curved a little bit.

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.333
Well, we, we're going to handle that.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.238
In fact, we're going to talk
about that in a minute.

00:00:42.238 --> 00:00:44.610
By doing something called
iterative refinement.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.030
Which is, we're going to
assume it's a plane, solve it.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.590
Move the picture over a little bit.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.020
Do it again, do it again, do it again,

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.080
until we've converged finally to the,
to the right point.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.470
And its, allows us to handle
the non-planar component.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.560
But in some sense, even much more worse.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.570
Much more worse?

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.610
Even worse than that, is maybe,
I've got a nice bright pixel here and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.580
then the bright pixel jumps
over a bunch of dark pixels.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.840
So it's not even, and then there's some
other, so it's not even local anymore.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.000
That is, I can't find my, my ni,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.290
the, where I went by just sort
of following my derivatives.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.760
And the way we're going to handle
that is with a course define method

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.650
which actually we're
going to do next lesson.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.811
Today, the on, the, this lesson,

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:32.100
the only remaining thing we're going to
talk about is this iterative refinement.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.750
So, iterative refinement is
designed to handle the fact

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.690
that things are not exactly tangent.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.560
And so, here's how it works.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.340
I'll write down the algorithm.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.720
And then it's a lot easier
to see in a picture.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:41.630
All right?

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.390
So, the first thing is,
the way you do it is,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.040
you say okay, I'm going to pretend.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.440
I'm good at pretending,
that it's just going to work.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.100
All right?

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.240
So, I solve for my velocities
using the standard Lukas-Kanade.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.100
So I find,
I assume linear Taylor approximation.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.520
I solve for u, v.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.090
Great.
So, now I've got a u, v at every pixel.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.390
Now, it says I'm going to
warp It to It plus 1.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.470
Okay.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.530
We talked about doing image warping
when we were applying transformations.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.570
And those of you who
are going to do the problem set,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.030
you'll probably get to know and
love how to do warping.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.566
But basically, the u,

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:21.790
v says how to move every pixel from
one image to get to the next one.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:22.400
So you know what?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.270
I take this picture and
I move all the pixels.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.120
And if you remember,
we have to do this backward warp so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.200
we don't end up with holes.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.130
If you don't remember that,

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.560
go back to the transformation lecture
where we talked about warping.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.695
But the idea is that we
essentially distort the,

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:39.400
the t image to move to where
I think all the pixels go.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.420
So it's almost the t plus one image.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.890
But it's not exactly the t
plus one image, is it?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.260
It's close.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.910
So what do I do?

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.176
I just do it again.
I take the image that I created and

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:56.494
I compare that to the real
t plus one image.

00:02:56.494 --> 00:02:58.526
And I get a small amount of more motion.

00:02:58.526 --> 00:03:02.750
I could actually add that
motion to the original motion.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.950
That's the new flow field.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.234
Well, I can take that one I created.

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:07.203
Move it a little bit.

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.225
And what do I do?

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:08.956
Do it again.

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:12.758
Until the pixels stop moving,
and that will it,

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:16.240
that will converge to a solution.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.980
So that's really easier
seeing here graphically.
