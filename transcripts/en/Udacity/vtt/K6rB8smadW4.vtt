00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the answer is that Bob can cheat.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And the reason that Bob can cheat--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
well, remember this hash function is not encryption.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
There are no secrets that go into it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It's only providing this commitment to the input,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and so Bob can easily cheat in this case.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He can compute by himself the hash of zero, the hash of one,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
check them, whether they equal m,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and then instead of guessing, he can pick whichever one did.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, with this protocol Bob can always win.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm going to leave it as an open discussion problem

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for you to figure out how to fix this protocol.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And there are definitely lots of different ways to do this.

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I hope there will be some interesting discussion about it on the forums.
