00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.580
I'd like to take a minute and

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.180
review some of the more
complex aspects of operators.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.260
Let's start by taking a look
at some binary numbers.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.110
Binary numbers are the crux
of bitwise operations.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.810
And even though bitwise
operators are not commonly used,

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.200
they're good to know for those special
cases when you really need them.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.300
I'll show you a good example of using
bitwise operators in just a moment.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.040
Here at the top of this playground file,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.330
I've defined the numbers 0
through 15 using binary literals.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.560
Notice the 0B prefix before
each of these numbers.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.100
On the right side of the playground
you can see how these binary numbers

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.540
are represented on our
normal base 10 system.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.370
Below this, I've defined
the numbers 0 through 15 again, but

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.470
with the hexidecimal literals.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.650
They're prefixed with the 0x.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.810
You can see that there.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.190
And again, the numbers are represented
in base 10 over to the right.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.410
Now for each of these constants I've
declared them as the type UInt8.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.920
An UInt8 type is similar to the Int type

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.410
except it restricts
the numbers from 0 to 255.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.190
And we're doing this here just
to keep the numbers small.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.520
What I mean by small is, is because it
takes so many binary digits to represent

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.090
a big base 10 number, we want to
keep those numbers really small so

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.480
that we don't have so much binary and
it just becomes really hard to look at.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.400
Now, you can return to this
series of constants as a good

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.810
reminder of how we can count
using binary or hexadecimal,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.540
and you can see how this
goes up by one each time.
