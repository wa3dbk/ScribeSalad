00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.910
Remember your boss in Toy City Part One?

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.240
Well they loved your sales report so

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.490
much they decided to surprise you
with an extra fun, special request.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.950
Your boss thinks they might
be able to save Toy City

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.170
if they can convince investors
to invest in the company.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.040
They've asked you to print
the sales report to a file so

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.990
they can easily share
the reports with investors.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.410
Your boss was also wondering if you
could somehow package up the code.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.870
So they can re-use pieces of
it in future sales reports.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.630
In this lesson, you're going to
use the new skills you've learned

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.640
to re-factor your code
from Toy City Part One.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.010
You'll then restructure your
code using methods, and

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.710
output your reports to a file,
instead of just the command line.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.520
You'll also start using Get to
track your changes that you make to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.940
the project files.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.780
All right, let's get started.
