00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.344
In our first example, you could work 40 hours and earn $400. Let's say you start

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:10.610
a new job that pays a different hourly wage. Now you're going to work 35 hours

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.890
and earn $630. At this new job, let's say you worked 35 hours and you earned

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.342
$630. How much could you earn working 50 hours? Whenever we saw problems

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:25.500
involving variation we want to set up a proportion. So let's make this really

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.880
simple. If I worked one hour, I would earn $10 based on my original example. So

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.754
if I work double that amount of time, I would get double the amount of money. I

00:00:34.754 --> 00:00:41.063
would earn $20. Notice that if my hours worked increased then my amount of money

00:00:41.063 --> 00:00:45.068
also increased. This is so that way these two fractions will be equal. And one

00:00:45.068 --> 00:00:49.163
of the biggest things we want to make sure of when solving variation problems is

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:53.938
that we have one fraction involving hours another involving income. We always

00:00:53.938 --> 00:00:58.456
want to keep our units the same. Whenever we have direct variation, the first

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:03.384
amount of one unit will be directly across from the first amount of the second

00:01:03.384 --> 00:01:08.238
unit. So when I'm filling in this proportion, 35 hours should go here for the

00:01:08.238 --> 00:01:13.178
amount of hours worked for one And $630 should go here for the income worked for

00:01:13.178 --> 00:01:20.353
1, because if we work 35 hours, we earned $630. So you try solving this one. How

00:01:20.353 --> 00:01:24.452
much money could we earn if we worked 50 hours? Be sure you don't include the

00:01:24.452 --> 00:01:27.823
dollar sign in your answer. I already have that written for you.
