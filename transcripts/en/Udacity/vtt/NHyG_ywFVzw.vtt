00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, mostly we're looking for correct code.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If you wrote some more tests, you may start to have some more confidence

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the code that we have.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We're also considering efficiency to some degree.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It seems like there's a big problem with the efficiency of the program we have so far.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let me show you one of the issues.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now we represented states as a (here, there, t) triplet.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The problem with this is there can be two states that have identical here and there's

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but differ in the t, and they're going to be considered different states.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Why is that a problem?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Consider this problem.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We have two people--one who takes 1 unit to cross the bridge, and one who takes 1000.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It seems pretty clear there is an easy solution. The two of them go across together.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It takes 1000, but look how we're going to explore this space.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We're going to start out in the initial state that took time 0,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then we're going to start adding things to the frontier.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Out of all the ways we could cross, the one that adds the least

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is for the 1 to go across by himself.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now he's on the other side with the 1 on the other side and the 1000 on the original side.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That only took 1 step.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now what's the fastest thing we can do after that?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We could take 1 more step and go back to the original state.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Here we had 1 and we'll call K for the 1000 on the left-hand side.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here K was left behind and 1 went over to the right.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Here we took one more time unit, and we had 1, K on this side.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If we continue taking the fastest step we can,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we'll get to another distinct state where K is on this side and 1 is on the other side.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The flashlight is always going with the 1.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We keep on going on like that. We'll go out 1000 different steps.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Each of these will be a distinct state,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because this will be the state with time t equals 0.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Here time t equals 1, t equals 2, t equals 3.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But really, although it looks like we're getting different states,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in another way of looking at it, we're always getting the same state.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We're just going back and forth from here to there and back to here and back and back.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We're going around in circles.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In order to recognize that these are in fact the same states,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we're going to have to take t out of our state,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and we're going to have to deal with the t someplace else.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We want our representation of a state to be just (here, there).

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We've got to figure out someplace else to put the t.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I'm not sure what the right way to do it is, but why don't we do it this way?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We have a path, which is state, action, state dot, dot, dot--

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
keeps on alternating between states and actions.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's change that so that the path is a state followed by a tuple of the action

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and the total time it took after applying that action,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
then the next state, then the next action and the total time after applying that, and so on.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That'll be our new representation.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
States are going to look like that, and paths are going to look like that.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now, I want you to write the new successor function for the bridge problem.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We'll call it bsuccessors2--the "2" just to keep it distinct from the first version.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Again it returns a dict of state-action pairs.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
A state now is just a two-tuple of (here, there),

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and the here and there are still frozen sets.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
It's pretty much the same except we dropped out the time t.

00:03:36.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Go ahead and implement that for me.
