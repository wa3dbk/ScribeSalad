00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.380
It turns out that all four of these problems

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.400
can and have been tackled using mapreduce. Chevron utilizes the

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.620
mapreduce programming model to sort and process data from

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.020
ships that search the ocean for seismic activity indicative of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.530
oil reserves. Tons of online commerce sites, eBay for

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.340
one, use mapreduce to manage their huge amounts of data

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.146
on sellers, buyers, and transactions. Some companies use mapreduce

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:26.210
to process data to identify malware and cyber attack patterns.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.450
A company called IPTrust for example used mapreduce to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.850
assign trustability scores to IP addresses. Finally products developed

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.120
by a company called Apixio leverage mapreduce to analyze

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.330
large amounts of data and help healthcare professionals answer questions

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.710
about their patients health. As you can see mapreduce

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.350
can be applied to a solve a wide range of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.740
problems. I'm sure you're anxious to use mapreduce to

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.210
solve our problems so let's discuss how the mapreduce programming

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.450
model actually works.
