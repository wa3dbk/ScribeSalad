00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.208
What we've used here is called a Composite Function. R is a function of N, but

00:00:05.208 --> 00:00:11.712
N is a function of d. So it ends up that R is actually a function of d. That's

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:15.190
really awesome. We'll come back to see example with the revenue and numbers in

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.700
a bit, but first let's talk about composite functions in general. To do this, I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.606
think we need a fresh set of functions, so how about these two, f of x equals x

00:00:23.606 --> 00:00:28.932
squared and g of x equals x minus one. When we talk about composition of

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:33.804
functions, this means that we're combining two functions in a special way. We

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:37.452
take the results, the output, of one function, and substitute that in, as the

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:42.814
input of the other function. For example, if I want to find f of g of x, I

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:50.173
would plug in the function g of x Everywhere I see a x in f. So in the case of

00:00:50.173 --> 00:00:55.680
these functions, the output of g of x is x minus one. So that's going to be the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.270
input of f. That means that f of g of x is really just f of x minus one. So

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.510
what expression do we get to complete this comoposite function?
