As you saw before, the distribution of ages of students taking Udacity courses

00:00:05.036 --> 00:00:09.701
is positively skewed, with small students being younger than older. Here's

00:00:09.713 --> 00:00:14.675
another example of a positively skewed distribution. Where you can see that most

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:19.545
values are on the left side than on the right. This is a distribution of income

00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:25.450
in the United States in 2005. You can see here is says 98% of households have a

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:31.740
household income of less than 250,000. And it looks like the highest frequency

00:00:31.752 --> 00:00:37.925
of household income is even less than 25,000 a year. What can we say about this

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:44.527
distribution? Can we say that it's symmetrical? The most common household income

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:50.242
is less than 25,000 per year. Most households make less than 100,000. Or

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:54.942
finally, no households have an income greater than 250,000.
