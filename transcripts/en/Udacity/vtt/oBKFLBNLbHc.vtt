00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.432
So let me elaborate on,

00:00:01.432 --> 00:00:01.839
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:02.116
on what

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:02.554
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:02.554 --> 00:00:06.485
said about learning the brain. Neuroscientist Eric Kandel conducted round

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:10.205
breaking research in the learning of neuro growth and it led fact to a Nobel

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:15.252
prize. One of Kandel's big insights in setting learning in the brain came from

00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:20.650
realizing it would be best to study in an animal with the simple. Rather than

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.199
complex nervous system. And one with really big nodes, ones we can actually see

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.120
with a naked eye. The perfect animal for this was the sea snail, he wanted to

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.220
see what happened, but the neural level when these animals learned, in the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.262
short term versus the long term. So we administered a single shot to activate

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:40.720
short term learning. And saw that the snail learned a defensive response, it

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.772
lasted for about ten minutes. But if the shock was administered four or five

00:00:44.772 --> 00:00:49.336
times the animals learned defense was long term, lasting days. But here's the

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:53.222
discovery that lead to the Nobel Prize, Kandell was the first neuroscientist to

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:58.910
discover how long-term learning happens at the neural level. He discovered

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.470
there were new proteins in the neurons for long-term learning, but not in the

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.926
short-term learning. And, these new proteins led to new neural structures, in

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:12.087
short, to neural growth. Upon further research, Kandel uncovered how these

00:01:12.087 --> 00:01:16.942
proteins form that led to new neural growth. Let's look at this figure. In this

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:22.024
neuron, we see a sensory neuron connected to a motor neuron and some activating

00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:28.230
neurotransmitter glutamate being released. This is the base line. Here in this

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.233
figure we see what happens in short term. Learning and memory. When a mild

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:37.789
stimulus is presented, more glutamate is released, strengthening the synaptic

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.050
connection. But note, there's no new neural structures that are growing. Now in

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.210
this image, we see what happens in long-term learning and memory. In response

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.600
to a strong stimulus. So many stimuli are being presented. The signal, then,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.884
goes up the axon to the nucleus of the cell, turning on particular genes, or a

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:03.129
set of genes, and then synthesize new proteins to form. These proteins then

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:08.044
create new neural structures down here. And even more glutamate is produced and

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:12.207
received by the motor neuron. So these new structures and strong synaptic

00:02:12.207 --> 00:02:15.944
connections stay for days and days. Leading to long term memory and learning.

00:02:15.944 --> 00:02:19.346
The moral of the story, is that long term learning changes your brain in a way

00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:24.820
that short term learning and memory do not. A finding worthy of a nobel prize.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.020
Now go out out and learn this material and change your brain for good.
