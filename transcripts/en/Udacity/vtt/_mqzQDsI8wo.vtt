We actually worked through a problem pretty similar to this at the end of the

00:00:03.602 --> 00:00:07.592
previous lesson. It was a different equation, and the leading coefficient was 1,

00:00:07.592 --> 00:00:11.362
so things were a little bit simpler, but the same sort of technique that we used

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:15.285
there applies here. I'd like you to complete the square, with the expression on

00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:18.705
the left side of the equation, and to get this equation to the point where

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:22.410
there's a non-zero integer on the right-hand side, and a term with our perfect

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.180
square in it on the left hand side.
