00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.140
Nothing happens in a vacuum, this class included.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.090
Now, while many of you may be taking this course because you're interested in

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.430
data visualization theory and practice using open source tools like D3,

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.210
this class is actually part of the much larger data science track at Udacity.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.520
What I've shown here is a graphic from Ben Fry's PhD thesis,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.010
Computational Information Design.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.070
In it, he describes the larger process surrounding data visualizations,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.330
including acquiring, transforming, and

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.200
eventually visualizing data to create engaging and effective graphics.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.330
This whole process maps quite nicely to the data science process as a whole.
