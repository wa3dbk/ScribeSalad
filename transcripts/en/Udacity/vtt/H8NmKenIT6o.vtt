00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.130
And the answer is the first three.

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.525
This last one doesn't make any sense,
because Yuv must be non-negative.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.270
If u were in B, and Y were in A,
then Yuv would be 0,

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.290
which shouldn't count towards
our objective function.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.880
One thing to notice immediately
about this program is that

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.450
because the capacities are all positive,
the Yuvs will be as small as possible.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:28.116
Next, the parallelism between
these equations suggest

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:33.309
that we think of, ys,
being a variable fixed as 1,

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.452
and yt, be a variable here, fixed as 0.

00:00:37.452 --> 00:00:42.197
All of these edge variables then
only need be greater than zero when

00:00:42.197 --> 00:00:47.820
the left hand variable over here is
one and the right hand one is zero.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.460
This immediately suggests that variables
with a single sub script indicate

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.150
which side of the partition in the s-t
cut the corresponding vertex is on.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.160
If they differ in the right direction.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:06.030
Then Yuv must be one,
it's an edge cut by the cut and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.610
the capacity of that edge counts
towards the objective function.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.920
The first three points follow
from this realization.
