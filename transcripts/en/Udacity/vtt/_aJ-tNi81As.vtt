00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.910
For each of these equations, m is just the coefficient in front of the term with

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:09.600
an x to the first. So, in the first equation, y equals 100 plus 50x, m is just

00:00:09.612 --> 00:00:14.296
50. There are two little potentially tricky spots here. Since in the second to

00:00:14.296 --> 00:00:19.268
the last equation, we have y equals 12 minus 3x, m is equal to negative 3. Since

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.996
you will recall that in the form of the equation, the general form, we have y

00:00:24.008 --> 00:00:28.730
equals mx and no sign in front of the m, so we need to include the sign as part

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:33.565
of the coefficient. The second potentially tricky thing is for the equation, y

00:00:33.577 --> 00:00:38.343
equals 5. We don't have a term here with an x. What that really means, is that

00:00:38.355 --> 00:00:43.003
we have the term plus 0x added onto the end of this. Clearly, 0x is just equal

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:47.535
to 0, but writing this let's us see that m, the slope here, is actually equal to

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:52.145
0. This actually makes sense, since y equals 5 is just a horizontal line, whose

00:00:52.157 --> 00:00:56.563
slope is 0. Moving onto our values of b, these are just the constant terms on

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:01.425
the right side of each of these equations. Negative signs need to be included as

00:01:01.437 --> 00:01:05.775
part of the b term, and then the equation y equals 5x, since we don't explicitly

00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:09.680
see a constant term added out here, b must be equal to zero. Having this

00:01:09.692 --> 00:01:13.940
information written out explicitly like this, makes writing the equations in y

00:01:13.952 --> 00:01:18.275
equals mx plus b form pretty simple. Hopefully, now you feel very confident that

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:21.430
all of these equations can be written in this precise form.
