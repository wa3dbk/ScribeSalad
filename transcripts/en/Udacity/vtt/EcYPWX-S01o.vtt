&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We saw earlier that 15 is equal to 3 times 5, but we know that this time a

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:09.320
and b need to both be negative. Well that's easy. 15's just equal to negative 3

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.162
times negative 5. And sure enough, those also add to equal negative 8. Order

00:00:14.162 --> 00:00:19.054
again here does not matter. It doesn't matter which one we call a and which one

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:22.935
we call b. Just matters that we got these two numbers. Great job.
