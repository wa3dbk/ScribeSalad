00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
[Narrator] I now want to ask you the really challenging question over here,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and it goes as follows: one of the weaknesses of slam is

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
as we move along and map a world by seeing these landmarks,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the matrix omega which is the big thing here and of course the vector C

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
grow linearly with the length of the path.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now this means if you go to your local supermarket and buy a robot,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and that robot lives for a long time, say a year or a decade,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
then this thing here, the path will be a really, really large even though the environment

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in which it might operate, the map might be of a fixed size,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and that means a robot programmed by graph SLAM

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
will eventually stop working because it gets slower and slower.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, we all know computer operating systems that have that property.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The older they are the slower they are, but we're not talking about how to fix operating systems.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We're just talking about how to fix SLAM.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The crucial idea that I want to tell you about and I want you to implement from scratch in our software

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is the following: we can actually reduce the map we maintain

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to one that only contains the most recent position in the path,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and all of the stuff over here can be safely erased when we build our map.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You don't know how to do it, but let me tell you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Suppose we have a robot position and we have a matrix omega

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that only contains the information pertaining to 1 position.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
If the position is 1 dimensional, it's just 1 row and 1 column.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Whereas, you might have many different entries for the map.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Suppose the robot moves to a new position; let's call it XT+1.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Then, we'd do exactly the following: we'd grow the matrix in the vector

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
by using the expand function that you're already familiar with

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
such that we now have space for our new position.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The new area we added are these rows over here.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's a single row of numbers of a position 1 dimensional.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It's 2 rows of number of a position that is 2 dimensional,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and it's this column, again, is just a single column if our position is 1 dimensional;

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
otherwise, it is 2 column, and we initialize those all by 0,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and then we can apply our regular motion update,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that as you know adds 1 or some number like 1 to the main diagonal

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and -1s off diagonal, and the same on the right side for the vector C.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
That is just a motion update but that runs the risk that our path increases.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now we go back to a form like this.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We make X2+1 survive.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Simplified speaking, you might think about doing this by just cutting out the new sub-matrix that starts over here,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and the sub-vector that starts over here; however, if you do this

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
as you can easily verify, that sub-matrix doesn't give you the correct answer,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and here is where the meat is.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We now cut out 3 sub-matrices or values from the full matrix on the right side.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
One sits here, that one I will call A.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
One is over here; it's a single element for a 1D robot,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but is a 2 x 2 matrix for a robot in 2D coordinates,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and one that I'll call C, and it's obvious to see that this thing over here

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that you want to cut out is called A-1.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
These values carry a lot of importance.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We can't just erase them, but we can forward them back into the surviving matrix

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
by the following simple operation:

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we take the surviving matrix to be called omega prime

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and the surviving vector to be called X prime,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and you can get omega prime and X prime by using the function take that is in your own matrix library.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You have to look into how to make take take exactly those elements over here,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and then if we modify X prime and C prime with the following piece of math.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We subtract from omega prime A transpose times B to the -1, the inverse, times A.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
If we implement this correctly this gives you a matrix of the same size as sigma prime,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and that's what you subtract to arrive at our reduced sigma.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Similarly you do the same for C.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
You subtract A prime minus B to the -1 times C.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This tends to be the same as Gaussian where we technically do away

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
or we call it integrate away the variable X1,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and I don't want to go into detail why that's correct.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
My book has a multi-page proof of that simple equation.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I just want to give you intuition here, which is these values do carry importance,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and to get rid of those you have to redistribute them into the remaining variables

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and that over here happens to be the math.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It's A transpose times B times A that you subtract from the remaining omega prime,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and the same for C over here.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
When you do this, you are now left with a matrix of the same original dimension

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because we first added the post and then we subtracted one,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and as you can see when you do this many, many times

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the final dimension of the matrix is only determined based on the size of the map

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
plus, well, a single entry which in the 1D case is 1 row and 1 column.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
In the 2D case is 2 of those corresponding to the robot position.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
That means SLAM scales to really large environments

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
because we can do the trick every single time a robot moves.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You asked for a challenging program assignment.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I promise you, you will be busy with it for awhile.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I'm giving you now my piece of code in which I implemented SLAM for you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You're familiar with this.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
You have all of that, and then I run SLAM with 3 landmarks,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
3 time steps, a world size of 100, and a measurement range of 100.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I make data at random as you're familiar with and you'll complete the result,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and the result in this case contains a vector of omega C and U concatenated.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Then what I might get out looks as follows:

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
there's 3 landmarks.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
There's a sequence of estimated positions leading up to the actual robot position.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They're both correct, and then there's estimates for where landmarks are.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Every time I run it, I get a different answer because my landmarks and my world is different every time.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Now I also implemented and that's your task now

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
a function called online SLAM.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
It does exactly what I told you to do.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
It resizes the matrix every time a new motion occurs

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and then goes back to the original size,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and I've printed out here as an example the information matrix omega

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and in the vector C that I obtained, and I also printed out the final result.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
In the final result, we get exactly the same estimated pose as for the full SLAM algorithm

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
which is 86.0 and 33.7.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I go down, these are exactly the same number for the estimated pose; that's how you can verify this.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The same is true for the estimated landmark.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Those coordinates are identical despite the fact that I reduce the size of omega and C,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but when I print omega and C, we find that the dimensionality is reduced.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's an 8 x 8 matrix omega, and the number 8 comes because there's 6 coordinates for the landmarks and 1 final robot pose.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
That is substantially smaller than the matrix I would obtain

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for the full SLAM case, and the same is true for the information vector of size 8; here's an example.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
What you are asked to do is to fill the entire online SLAM routine and to do this,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:46.000
every time you get a new pose, you want to expand to grow the matrix by inserting something right behind the existing pose.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
You then run take to take out the sub-matrix.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:59.000
You also calculate A, B, and for the information vector C,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and then as before your reduced omega is obtained with this equation,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and your reduced C is obtained with this equation.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
If you make no mistake, then you get exactly the same area as you had before,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and you can test your routine and arbitrary maps and arbitrary data sets,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and it'll just be fine.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So, good luck; this is a wonderful programming assignment

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
because it gives you the first really scalable SLAM algorithm

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and when you implement it, it's actually a major achievement.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I can tell you it took the scientific feat of SLAM easily 15 years to really discover this form,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and ever since what was really complex and involved lots of common failures,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and I can tell you lots of headaches, became amazingly easy.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So, implement it and you can call yourself a robotic mapper.
