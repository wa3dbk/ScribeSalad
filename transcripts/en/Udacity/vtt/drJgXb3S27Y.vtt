00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this problem, we're going to build a procedure that sees into the mind

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of a finite state machine.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Given the definition for a non-deterministic finite state machine,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we're going to use our crystal ball of Python code

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to read into the mind of the finite state machine

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and output any string if there exists one

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that is accepted by that finite state machine.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This sounds like some pretty powerful stuff, but believe it or not,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you have all the tools to do this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Here I have an outline for a finite state machine,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I didn't bother to label any of the edges,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and let's just add a few more for fun.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The strategy we're going to use is starting from the starting state,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we're going to follow every edge, and as long as we don't visit

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a node that we've already visited, we're going to continue along

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
until we reach an accepting state.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We're then going to go back, building up a string

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that goes the other way, so the last character is going to be this edge.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The second to last is going to be this one,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and the third to last will be this one.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Yeah, there are strings that would match if we went here

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then looped at the 3 for a while.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But the question only asks us to give one, and this is the best way to do it.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We do have to take into account the issue of kind of an infinite loop.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
How do we know that we're never going to finish,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
never going to reach the accepting state?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I hinted at that earlier.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We're just going to avoid revisiting the same node over and over again

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because all we care about is making forward progress.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In this one I can follow the 1 over and over again, just looping around forever,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but I'll never reach the accepting state 2, so what I'm going to say is if I

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
follow the edge back to the 1,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I haven't made any progress, so I'm going to stop following edges

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
from the 1 along that path.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If there so existed a second edge that led from the 1 and the 2,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I would take that immediately and go right to the 2,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
so I can ignore the looping forever.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Hopefully you're still with me.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now I'm going to walk you through--believe it or not--

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the recursive solution to this problem.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Here I have the declaration for my procedure.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The inputs are the current state,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the representation of our machine the accepting states,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the states that we visited so far, and as a reminder,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
what we're going to return is none if we reach a failure point.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Otherwise we're going to start returning the edge that led us to this state,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
or more precisely, the next state, and build up the string as we go backwards

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
from the accepting state.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Okay, okay. Let's go right to the base case.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
If we've already visited this node, we're not making forward progress,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and this isn't going to lead us to the accepting state,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so we're going to return none.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If we're currently in an accepting state, then we're going to return the empty string.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
We don't need to operate on any more edges

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to reach the accepting state.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Here I'm adding the current state

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to what's going to be the new list of visited states.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And here I'm looking up all the outgoing edges

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
from the current state, and for each outgoing edge we find,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
we're going to recurse with the new state,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the new list of visited states, if following that path,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
eventually leads us back to something that we've already visited,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
or if there are no outgoing edges, basically if we failed,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
then foo will be none.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
If it's not none, that means we've found something.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We found an accepting state, so we're going to start returning

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
our string, and so the string I'm going to return is the character

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that I followed to the new state

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
plus the string that was returned by our recursive call.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This string represents all the characters that it took to get

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
from newstate to the accepting state.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This could be an empty string.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It could be 100 different characters. It doesn't really matter.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And in case there are no outgoing edges, as I mentioned before,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
we're going to return none as well.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
That's it.

00:04:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
13 lines of code to read the mind of a finite state machine.
