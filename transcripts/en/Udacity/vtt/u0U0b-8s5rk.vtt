00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.295
Here's a more elaborate keyframe animation by Jason Kadrmas, showing multiple

00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:07.480
keyframes in different rotations and translations. This was created in Blender,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.257
a free modeling program, and exported to a file format three.js can read. I

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:15.312
simply dropped this file into Jason's program threefab, running in a browser

00:00:15.312 --> 00:00:19.432
window, and can play through the animation at different speeds. Watching the

00:00:19.432 --> 00:00:22.036
animation play, you can see how just a few keyframes can define some fairly

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:23.540
elaborate motions.
