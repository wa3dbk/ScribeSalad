00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.170
Now that you've had practice calculating the mean, before we move on, we're

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.857
going to go over some properties of the mean. We're going to do this with a

00:00:07.857 --> 00:00:11.952
quiz, and this'll be a very challenging question that requires you to think

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:16.548
about what we've discussed and remember how you calculated the mean. If you can

00:00:16.548 --> 00:00:21.867
get the answer to this, I'll be super happy. And, if not, don't worry. Again,

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:26.456
this is a very challenging conceptual question. So what are properties of the

00:00:26.456 --> 00:00:31.170
mean? Check all that apply. All scores in the distribution affect the mean. The

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.876
mean can be described with a formula. Many samples from the same population will

00:00:35.876 --> 00:00:40.738
have similar means. The mean of a sample can be used to make inferences about

00:00:40.738 --> 00:00:45.602
the population it came from, or the mean will change if we add an extreme value

00:00:45.602 --> 00:00:46.646
to the data set.
