00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The big question now is can we write a program that finds the shortest path from start to goal?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
To do so, let's give the grid cell names.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We have 6 columns, named from 0 to 5, and 5 rows, from 0 to 4.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The basic idea I'll pursue is that I keep a list of notes that I wish to investigate further

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or, as we call it in search, expand.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's call this list "open."

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In the beginning we only have 1 state on this list at [0, 0]--my initial state.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Just to make sure I never pick this state again--I don't want any cycles in my path--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
let me just check mark this state with a little red check.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I now can test whether this state is my final goal state.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Obviously, it's not. I'm not done with planning yet.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
What I do next is expand this state.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I take it off my open list and look at all the successors,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of which there are 2 over here--[1, 0] and [0, 1].

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Those two are now expanded, so I check them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
One last thing I maintain for each of these

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
states on the open list is how many expandages it took to get there.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This was 0 over here, and it's 1 for these 2 states in red.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That's called my "g-value."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
When I'm done with planning, this will be the length of the optimal path.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's now go further and expand one of the two.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We always expand the one with the smallest g-value, but these are equivalent.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They both have a g-value of one, so it doesn't make a difference.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Let me expand the first one. This one over here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This one has 3 neighbors--[0, 0], [1, 1], and [2, 0].

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But because [0, 0] is already closed with a check mark, we don't consider it anymore,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which gives me [2, 0] and [1, 1],

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
both now with a g-value of 2, and we check those over here.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I now pick the node on the open list with the smallest g-value,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
which happens to be this one over here. There's really no choice.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's the node over here.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And this has 2 neighbors--[0, 0] and [1, 1]--but both are already checked.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Therefore, there is no expansion that takes place.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I only expand if I find an unchecked node.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The new open list are these two nodes over here.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What's going to happen is my nodes will expand gradually into the free space

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
until I eventually hit the goal node.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Without proof, the g-value when I hit the goal node will be exactly

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the number of steps it takes to go from the start state to the goal node.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The secret here for that to be the case lies in the fact

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that I always expand the node with the smallest g-value.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But we won't worry about this.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What I want you to do is to implement a piece of code

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that implements what I just described.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
To warn you, this is a bit of work. Here is my coding environment.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
My grid is this one over here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's the same as the grid over here.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You can see the obstacles here and the T-shaped obstacle over here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Our starting location is [0, 0], which is the first one you put on the open list.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Our goal happens to be [4, 5], which is the coordinate of the cell over here,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
starting count of course at [0, 0].

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I've also coded for you the 4 potential actions into a single field called delta,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
so that when you go through the different successors on the list in the search

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
you can just go through these sequentially.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The first one goes up by subtracting 1 from this dimension.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The second one goes left. The third one goes down. The fourth one goes right.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Ignore for now the names of these actions. I will use them later.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I want to use the cost function of 1, so each step costs you exactly 1 for now.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I'd like you to write a piece of software that outputs triplet's of this type

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
where the first value is the g-value and the next two are the coordinates x and y.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
It then retrieves the element with the smallest g-value from the list,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
expands it--the grid cells [0, 0] gets expanded to [1, 0] and [0, 1].

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The g-value is incremented to 1 in both cases.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Then as I scroll down a little bit,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
now it takes again one of the items with the smallest g-value,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
breaking ties whichever way you want to break them. There's a tie over here.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I just happened to take the second one.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Expand this one into a new successor.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the only one that's not checked yet in the table is [1, 1], which gets a g-value of 2.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Now remove again the element with the smallest g-value, which is now the first one.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's being taken down from the list over here

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to produce a new open list that's sitting over here.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
As it goes through this--I'm going to scroll down a little bit more.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
You can see these different elements being taken.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You can see the g-value keep going up--3, 4, and so on, all the way to 7 here.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
At the very end, when the g-value turns 11, it should expand node [3, 5],

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
which is this one over here, find it's only non-checked neighbor,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
which is [4, 5]--this guy over here, and add to the list with the g-value of 11.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
When it then looks at the remaining list and picks the one with the smallest g-value,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
which is this one over here, it should identify that this is actually

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the goal state and call the search a success.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Now, this is all intermediate debugging output.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
What I want your code to output just for us to check

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
is just the final triplet of the g-value

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and the coordinate of the very last item that is being retrieved.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This is the path length over here, and this is the coordinate of the goal,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
which is the same as the one over here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I want you to write the code to only output this one triplet over here.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Your code should output to this grid over here--[11, 4, 5],

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and [4, 5] is the goal coordinates. There's nothing interesting here, but the 11 is the key thing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It takes 11 steps to go from here to here.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
If I change this, for example, by opening up this grid cell over here.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It now takes 2 steps less.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I want to see the 9 over here.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
If instead I force a greater detour,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I see now a 15 over here for this maze where you have to go down,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
left, up again, and down again.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
If there's no way to reach the goal point,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
as is the case if I block out this entire area over here.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Then I want the program to output "fail"--the single word "fail."

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Please implement this using the algorithm idea that I've just given you.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
It's going to be difficult. It's going to take you a while.

00:06:50.000 --> 99:59:59.999
But if you do this, you're almost where I want you to be to learn about A*.
