00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.370
Now that we have seen Pshare and Gshare, let's

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.320
do a quiz about them. Let's say that we

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.860
have this fragment of C code, where I goes

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.020
from 1,000 down to zero. And for odd number

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.990
I's, we are going to add the I to N, otherwise we just don't do it. This code

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.758
might translate into a similar program like this. This

00:00:21.758 --> 00:00:24.956
branch here is the test for exiting this loop,

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:27.896
when r1 is zero. This is testing the

00:00:27.896 --> 00:00:32.000
least significant bit of r1. And if that bit

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.080
is zero, that means we have an even number, so we jump to the even label. If the

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.680
number is odd then we add it to R3

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.280
which in this case is representing n. Either way

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.590
we decrement the R1, this is the I minus,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.610
minus and we unconditionally branch back to the loop.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.760
And the exit label for exiting the loop is here. If we want to get good

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.780
accuracy on all of the branches in this

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.150
code, then the history should be how much for

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.920
Pshare, write the number here, and for Gshare,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.298
write the number here. So we're just talking about

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.008
how many bits of history we need, to

00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:08.760
get good prediction accuracy for all of these branches.
