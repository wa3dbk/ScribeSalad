00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.460
So, this was a design mock given to me by a designer.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.990
The left pane here is just information on colors.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.730
So, you can just ignore it for now.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.120
Now, we just finished talking about boxes and boxes and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.810
how fun it is to draw boxes around things.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.690
So, when you see a page like this, we need to start looking at it and think,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.880
how do I draw a box around every visual element here, and then, how do I

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.759
do it until I'm down to a very simple element, like a single image or paragraph?

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.420
Well, the best way to learn how is to actually do it.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.700
I'll get you started by drawing the first three.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.360
First, we'll have a box around this header here.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, inside this box, I see two other boxes.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.270
One around our image here, and another around our name and title over here.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.950
Now it's your turn to draw the rest of the boxes around the remaining elements.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.370
A link to the mock is included for you in instructor notes.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.830
Now don't worry, I'm not going anywhere.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.420
When you're done please let me know how you completed this task,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.260
and how many boxes you ended up using to divide the page.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.060
Now, when you boxify this design, and yes, that's a technical term, boxify,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.220
did you save an image of the design and draw boxes with a graphics program?

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.090
Did you just draw the boxes separately on a piece of paper?

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.730
Did you print out the page and draw on it?

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.030
Or did you print out the page and cut it up with scissors?

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.100
And don't forget to let me know how many boxes you found on the page.
