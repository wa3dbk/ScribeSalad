00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.461
Before I can write the code, I need to figure out exactly what each of these

00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.880
corners is, so that I can think about the end points of each of the lines I

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:14.146
need to draw are. This line's pretty easy, it goes from 20, 30 to 50, 10. This

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:18.486
one's a little bit trickier, this point is at the same height as that one, so

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:24.340
it's at 10. And it's 100 to the right from 50. That means that its x value is

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.994
matching up with this one, so that looks good. This point is 100 over from this

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:39.220
one. So, 100 plus 20. And this point, gives us 120, 30. And this point is 40,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:46.642
down from this one. So 120, and 70. So we got that first line. Now the second

00:00:46.642 --> 00:00:58.669
one. Is from 50, 10 to 150, 10. This line is 120, 30 to 150, 10. This line is

00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:12.658
150, 10 to 150, 50. And this line. 120, 70 to 150, 50. The rectangle has its

00:01:12.658 --> 00:01:19.217
top length here, and it gives us the width and the height. So we know how to

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:22.444
specify that one. Here's how I wrote the code to draw the crate. There's a

00:01:22.444 --> 00:01:29.370
rectangle, which is that front face. Top left 20, 30, width 100, height 40.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.670
Then there's that leftmost line. 20, 30 to match the point that it starts at

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.920
and 50,10 to match the point that it ends at. Then I did the same thing with

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:47.028
the top line, middle line, the rightmost line, and the bottom one. Then I had

00:01:47.028 --> 00:01:50.798
to remember to draw each of these lines. And if I run this program, it draws

00:01:50.798 --> 00:01:55.671
the three dimensional crate that I wanted. Good work if you got that. That was

00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:59.552
a lot of getting all of the right coordinates in place. But if you did that,

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.019
you should be pretty familiar with drawing lines now.
