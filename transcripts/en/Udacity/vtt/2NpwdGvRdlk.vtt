00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.120
We have seen some aspects of VLIW.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.840
Now let's discuss VLI backward compatibility as a

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.218
quiz. Let's say we have a simple VLIW processor. It has a 64-bit that specifies

00:00:12.218 --> 00:00:15.129
two operations, so it's roughly equivalent to

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.182
two normal instructions, and let's say that this

00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:21.590
processor fetches, decodes and executes, etc, one of

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.262
the 64-bit instructions per cycle. Now, we want

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:26.936
to build a better version of this

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:30.010
processor. It can do four operations per cycle.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.771
So, it will need to fetch the code and execute two of those 64-bit instructions

00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:41.152
per cycle. The question for you is, is this new processor a VLIW processor? The

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:46.920
possible answers for you are yes it is, or no it's not really a VLIW processor.
