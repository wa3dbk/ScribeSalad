00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.014
We see here that the term with an x in it has a coefficient of negative 3. So

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:08.191
like we've done before, we just divide by that coefficient, and, of course, you

00:00:08.203 --> 00:00:12.122
do this at both sides. 12 divided by negative 3 is negative 4. so x equals

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:12.703
negative 4.
