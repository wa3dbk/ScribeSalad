00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.610
&gt;&gt; This doesn't look like
the JSON we're used to.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.500
Well, the truth is this data is JSON.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.900
It's just JSON in it's raw byte form.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.090
That's what all these hex numbers are.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.660
In order to actually understand and
use it,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.710
we'll need to convert it from raw JSON
into an object we can use in Swift.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:15.530
And guess what?

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.180
Swift has just the class for us.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.720
It's called NSJSONSerialization, and it
allows us to convert JSON into objects

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.480
like arrays or
dictionaries and vice versa.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.890
Since we want to go from
JSON data to an object,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.380
we'll use a method called
JSON object with data.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.560
This take our raw JSON data and
returns either an NS dictionary or

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.810
an NS array,
which are both usable in Swift.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.860
Okay, let's go use it in our code.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.170
We can start back in this little spot
where we're printing the raw data.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.790
Now, instead of printing it,
let's convert it.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.750
We should start by using optional
binding to get our data out

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.850
of optional form and
make sure that it exists.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.610
Then, let's create an object that
will eventually contain our parsed

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.880
dictionary result.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.410
We can call it parsed result.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:07.797
And now, let's add in that method
NSJSONSerialization.JSONObjectWithData

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:15.700
with data as our first parameter, and
AllowFragments as the second parameter.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.158
And save that result
to our parsedResult.

00:01:23.257 --> 00:01:26.050
What's this?

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.490
Can call throw, but it's not marked
with try and the error is not handled.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.350
It looks like this method
can throw an error.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.926
Let's use Swift's do catch block and
the try keyword to handle it.

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.690
If you haven't seen this error
handling syntax before, or

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.060
would like a refresher, feel free to
check out the Swift syntax course.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.240
But overall,
this will be pretty straightforward.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.241
Let's add the do catch block like so.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.738
And then, put in the try keyword in
front of the potentially problematic

00:01:52.738 --> 00:01:53.337
method call.

00:01:55.194 --> 00:01:57.200
And that looks like that was it.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.800
Should we try and print?

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.770
First, we should probably change
this data to parsedResult.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.309
Let's try and print it.

00:02:07.394 --> 00:02:08.710
Grab new image.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.740
Cool.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.530
This looks more like it.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.250
For the record, serialization means
converting an object into a stream

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.350
of bytes, and deserialization
usually means the opposite,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.430
converting a stream of
bytes into an object.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.098
But for simplicity, Apple groups these
both under MSJSON serialization.
