00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Let's say we have a formula like ODD plus ODD equals EVEN.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, one of the rules of the way we form numbers is that we don't want to have

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
a number that starts with 0.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
EVEN could be, say, 3435.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That would be a perfectly valid set of digits to fill in for the word EVEN.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It shouldn't be 0405, because we just don't normally write numbers with a leading zero.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I excluded that. How did I do it?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I did a regular expression search for the regular expression slash b,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which matches at a word boundary--b stands for boundary.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Then I'm looking for a zero followed by any digit 0-9.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm looking for that within f, and I want that to be not true.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If I took this string here--something plus something equals 0405,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and I did this regular expression search, it's saying find me a word boundary,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
a boundary between a letter and/or a digit

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and something that's a punctuation or something else,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a word boundary followed by a 0, followed by another digit,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
it would say, yes, indeed, that search does succeed.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It succeeds right here. The 0 and the 4 match.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I want that not to succeed, so I would return False.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I would rule out this case where we have a word starting with 0 and 4.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I did that, one, just because it's good form

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that normally you don't allow valid numbers to start with a zero,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and also because in Python we could come up with an error because of that.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Here is the problem.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
In a Python program, the string 012 corresponds to an integer,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but the integer it corresponds to is not 12. It's 10. Why is that?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Well, it's an old historical accident.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Way back in the 1970s, the C programming language defined it that way,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
where they said any number that starts with a 0 is going to be interpreted

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
as an octal number, which means base 8.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So 012 means one 8, zero 8-squared, and 2 more, so 8 + 2 is 10.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So that would give us the wrong answer if we allowed octal numbers

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to sneak in where we were expecting decimal.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It would also give us a possible error.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
If we had the string 09 that gives you an error, because 9 is not an octal digit.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
To avoid all those problems, I put in this regular expression that says

00:03:13.000 --> 09:59:59.000
any time you see a lead zero just rule it out.
