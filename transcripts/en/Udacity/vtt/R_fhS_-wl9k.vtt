00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.490
By now you've realized that data is often messy

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.730
and unorganized. Because of that, a large amount of a

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.450
data scientist's time is spent extracting and cleaning the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.980
data that they will use to perform analyses or make

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.730
visualizations. Let's get our feet wet and first discuss

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.510
the various ways that we might load our data. If

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.730
we want to programmatically process and analyze our data, it's

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.810
very important to understand the structure of the data itself.
