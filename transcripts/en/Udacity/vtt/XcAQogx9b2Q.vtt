00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.540
In previous lessons we have seen, that a Superscalar processor will try to

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.800
execute more than one instruction per cycle. The VLIW processors,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.740
are trying to achieve the same amount of work per cycle but in a different way.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.040
So let's compare the two approaches and see how the VLIW processors differ from

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.340
the out of order, and in order Superscalar processors that we have been already

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.400
seeing. So what we will do is compare the out of order Superscalar processor.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.150
The in-order Superscalar processor, and the very long instruction word, or

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.240
the VLIW processor according to several things.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.680
First, how many instructions per cycle do we try to do.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.840
An N issue out-of-order Superscalar processor is trying to do

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.960
up to N instructions per cycle. And in-order Superscalar processor,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.460
is also trying to do up to N instructions per cycle. A VLIW processor

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.260
is different in that it tries to execute 1 large instruction per cycle, but

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.280
that one large instruction does the same work as N normal instructions would do,

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.420
so really we're trying to do the same work per cycle. But the Superscalar

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.280
processors are trying to do more than one simple instruction per cycle,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.400
where as [UNKNOWN] VLIW processor does one large instruction that really does

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.490
the same work as N of these; but it needs to be given a single instruction to do

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.940
per cycle. In terms of, how do we find independent instructions that we can

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.580
do in a cycle, the out-of-order Superscaler processor finds its N instructions,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.950
by looking at much than this number of instructions in its instruction window.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.980
So it fetches the code is, and

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.530
then kind of has a window of more than n instructions. And

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.550
among these it's trying to find the N, that it needs to execute. In contrast,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.870
an in-order Superscalar processor is trying to execute up to N instructions per

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.810
cycle by looking at only the next N instructions in program order. So it

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.770
doesn't maintain this huge instruction window among which it is trying to find N

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.960
instructions, instead it just tries to see whether the next N instructions or

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.156
some subset of them can be executed in program order in parallel.

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:23.790
A VLIW processor doesn't. Even try to find independent instructions.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.876
It simply tries to do the next large instruction. So

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:33.500
it behaves like a non-Superscalar processor that executes instructions in order.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.870
It's just that each of these instructions is really, describing a lot of work.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.330
In terms of hardware cost, this. Looking at many instructions,

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.780
in order to find the N that we are looking for in an out-of-order Superscalar

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.490
processor is really expensive. The in-order Superscalar processor,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.810
does a lot less work and needs a lot less hardware to find the instructions.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.204
So it's less expensive in terms of harder costs than they're out-of-order

00:03:05.204 --> 00:03:10.510
Superscalar cousins. The VLIW processor reduces that cost even further, so

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.990
it's even less expensive than an in-order Superscalar processor for

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.480
the same amount of work per cycle, assuming we can find that work

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.310
because we are now even simpler in finding that work. And that brings us to

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.848
our last point, which is does the processor need help from the compiler?

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:34.010
In an out-of-order Superscalar processor, it does pretty well, even without any

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:40.050
compiler help. But the compiler can help improve the program performance.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.410
An in-order Superscalar processor is more dependent on the compiler. If

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.090
the compiler doesn't do anything to put independent instructions. Consecutively

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.670
than an in-order Superscalar processor will not have good performance,

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.239
it performance will lack significantly. The performance that an out-of-order

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.968
Superscalar processor with the same issue with would be able to achieve. So

00:04:01.968 --> 00:04:06.050
an in-order Superscalar processor really needs help from the compiler,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.902
without such help it is going to perform significantly worse. Then,

00:04:10.902 --> 00:04:13.930
an out-of-order Superscalar processor would. And finally,

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.878
VLIW processor completely depends on the compiler, to produce performance.

00:04:18.878 --> 00:04:24.120
If we don' have a good compiler, a VLIW processor will fail miserably as

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.740
far as performance is concerned. So as we can see among this three,

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.090
the out-of-order Superscalar processor is trying to do,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.380
kind of like a hardware intensive. I don't need much help from anybody, but

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.350
it sacrifices hardware to do that. An in-order Superscalar processor tries to

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.360
reduce the hardware cost, but still can execute the same program that

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.450
an out-of-order Superscalar processor could. And in some programs,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.970
it really needs compiler help in order to achieve good performance. And

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.690
finally, a VLIW processor goes to the extreme of completely depending on

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.490
the compiler to provide and express the parallelism it needs to do work.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.990
But in exchange, it gives us much lower cost.
