00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.740
Another thing that is a problem with Tomasulo's Algorithm is when we try to do

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.990
branch mispredictions. So, how do we recover from a branch misprediction? So,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.250
say we have a program like this. Where we have a divide, you take something like

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.570
40 cycles and once we get that result, we can resolve this branch over here. So,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.710
this branch can be predicted but it can take a long time to realize that it's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.678
been mispredicted. So let's say, meanwhile, we have fetched this instruction,

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:30.270
because a branch should have been taken. We have fetched this instruction, and

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.100
this instruction is already done. In that case, R3 is already written. Once we

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.700
realize that we have mispredicted this branch, possibly 40 to 50 cycles later,

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.400
we should behave like we have never executed this instruction, and instead start

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.190
fetching instructions from the label that the branch is pointing to,

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.460
but that becomes impossible because R3 by that time has already been updated. So

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.600
instead of having the old value of R3, now we have the new value of R3 when we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.150
jump to the label. So again, the problem is very similar to precise exceptions.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.760
In that, pretty much, an instruction can complete and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.550
write to registers before preceding instructions have fully been verified, and

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.240
before we even know that this instruction should have been executed. A final

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.310
problem occurs because of so-called phantom exceptions. So what we can have is,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.057
let's say there is a divide here. Let's say that we have mispredicted this

00:01:19.057 --> 00:01:22.130
branch. Let's say that this instruction doesn't execute too soon and so

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.165
on. But the problem is, if there is a divide here and it generates an exception,

00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:30.110
that the exception will be triggered even though this instruction was

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.150
never supposed to be executed. So when we come back, we have now a problem of,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.750
basically we have already started exception processing for this.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.130
We have, you know, done everything for this exception by the time we

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.600
realize that it's too late. So again, we have to somehow take care of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.080
not having exceptions until we are sure that they should happen.
