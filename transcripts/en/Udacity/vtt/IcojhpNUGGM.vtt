00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.160
Here's the start of our program. I've setup a few variables. Note the initial

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.975
balance of $100. My target of a million dollars. The interest rate of 1%, and

00:00:08.975 --> 00:00:13.976
right now we're in year zero. In Java, you use the while loop to repeat

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:19.162
statement. And that's exactly what we need. We want to repeat the statements

00:00:19.162 --> 00:00:23.220
that add the interest. Here, we compute the interest. Here we add the interest

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.530
to the balance. Each time we do that, we also want to increment the year

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.670
because after all, we want to keep track of how many years this process takes.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.864
And finally, we want to print out. Just so that we have a running total of the

00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:39.444
current year and the current balance which is what you see here. How long do we

00:00:39.444 --> 00:00:42.996
want to do this? We want to do it while the balance is less than the target,

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:47.468
the balance starts out at a $100 gets larger and larger. Eventually, it'll

00:00:47.468 --> 00:00:51.104
exceed the target and then the loop will stop. Now, let's run this program and

00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:57.100
here it runs. Look at this, after 926 years, we've reached a million dollars.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.390
That's actually not so bad. So, I have to wait less than a millenium to become

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.859
a millionaire. You can do the same thing.
