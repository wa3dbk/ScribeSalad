00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.758
Now as Doctor Zelig says, the ABCs can be used intentionally to change

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:08.725
behavior. But, we should also be aware that the ABCs occur in our natural

00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:13.656
environment. For example, let's say you're thirsty. This is a motivation, then

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:17.562
you see the refrigerator, which is the cue, and you grab a soda and drink it,

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:25.368
which is the behavior. Then your thirst is quenched. Annie had something tasty

00:00:25.368 --> 00:00:29.444
to drink, which is the consequence. Because the consequence was positive, this

00:00:29.444 --> 00:00:32.616
tells me that I'm more likely to go to the refrigerator and get a drink when

00:00:32.616 --> 00:00:37.876
I'm thirsty. However, there's another way you can look at this. Let's take the

00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:42.208
same scenario. First say you're thirsty, which is your motivation. You see the

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.688
refrigerator, which is your cue. So the behavior in this scenario is that you

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:50.616
grab milk and drink it. But it was sour milk. So the consequence in this

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:53.448
scenario is that you spit out the milk and it was really gross, it didn't

00:00:53.448 --> 00:00:58.144
quench your thirst. So this is a negative consequence. Therefore, you're

00:00:58.144 --> 00:01:00.696
going to be less likely to go back to the refrigerator and grab milk in the

00:01:00.696 --> 00:01:01.780
future.
