00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.080
So, let's see if we can do
some MSI protocol transitions.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.270
Let's say we have two cores
with private caches and

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.380
that the caches are using
MSI to maintain coherence.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.410
Initially, block X is in memory and
no cache has it.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.280
So here are the actions of
the caches in C1 and C2's cache.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.840
Core 1 issues a read X.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.040
Meanwhile, core 2 doesn't do anything.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.540
What is the state of block X in C1's
cache after this read is completed?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.600
And what is the state of
the block x in C2's cache,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.540
after this read on C1 is completed?

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.590
So put your MS or I state here and
another one here.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.590
Now, let's say that the next axis is
that C2 read X after this is completed,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.200
what is the new state of X in C1 and
C2's cache?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.100
And finally C1 does
another axis write X,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.880
what is now the state in C1's cache
after this write is complete?

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.720
And what's the state in C2's cache
after this write on C1 is complete
