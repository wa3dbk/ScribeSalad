00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.560
We can use a similar approach for a problem like this, the absolute value or the

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:10.854
distance of 2 d plus 1 is 7. Notice I can draw the same diagram. This could be

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:16.068
the location of 2 d plus 1 at negative 7, or 2 d plus 1 could be positive 7. The

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:21.507
distance of this expression is 7 on both sides of the number line. So, we're

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.442
asking ourselves, what value of d would make this true? What do you think? What

00:00:26.454 --> 00:00:31.032
would d equal in this case and d equal in this case? Take some time to think

00:00:31.044 --> 00:00:31.565
about it.
