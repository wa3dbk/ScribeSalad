00:00:00.223 --> 00:00:04.470
Welcome to the mini-unit. It's really about how to learn new things

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.058
When you're trying to develop as a programmer as well as trying to understand how to solve

00:00:08.058 --> 00:00:12.668
new problems. In CS101, I tried to keep things as simple as possible,

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:16.438
using only a very small subset of Python. The reason for this

00:00:16.438 --> 00:00:20.339
was to focus on learning new concepts in Computer Science

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.853
rather than learning lots and lots of different Python constructs.

00:00:23.853 --> 00:00:28.405
And I think that is the right way to begin as a computer scientist. You should learn

00:00:28.405 --> 00:00:31.984
to construct programs using only a few simple things that you understand well,

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:35.856
focusing on the problems to solve, the algorithms to solve them

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:39.919
and understanding how things work, rather than learning lots

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:43.273
of new language constructs. But if you want to become a better programmer,

00:00:43.273 --> 00:00:47.070
well then, you need to start learning more of the language. And most of our courses

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.925
don't focus on that. They focus on concepts important for problem-solving,

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:54.993
understanding what's going on in a computation and analyzing

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:58.894
and reasoning about them. But to become a better programmer, you also need to learn more

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:02.605
of the language. And the main goal of this unit is to help

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:06.401
you learn how to actually learn things on your own. Becoming a better

00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:10.438
programmer really depends on two things - it depends on experience:

00:01:10.438 --> 00:01:13.922
and you get experience by solving more and more problems; and it depends on

00:01:13.922 --> 00:01:18.004
knowledge. And you gain knowledge also by solving problems, but

00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.392
it's a different kind of thing. Knowledge means learning more language constructs,

00:01:22.392 --> 00:01:26.323
learning more algorithms, knowing more different ways of solving problems.

00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:30.709
That's different from the experience you get by solving a lot of problems yourself.

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.709
And both of those are important for becoming a better programmer.
