00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.480
As you might imagine, with an important
area such as image loading,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.450
there are actually a large number
of libraries providing this

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.490
exact functionality,
each a little bit different.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.730
Comparing similar libraries can
be a laborious process, but

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.730
can really give you a deep understanding
of how the libraries work.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.030
For Sunshine, we'll use Glide, the image
loading library that is flexible and

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.570
has a number of optimizations to
allow it to work efficiently within

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.330
a scrolling list and work alongside
the activity and fragment life cycles.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.180
It is used in a number of Google Apps,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.930
including Google Camera, Photos,
Field Trip, and the Google I/O app.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.440
With an easy Getting Started guide,
good documentation, and

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.020
the full source code,
there's a lot to like.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.660
Let's see how we can use Glide for
Sunshine.
