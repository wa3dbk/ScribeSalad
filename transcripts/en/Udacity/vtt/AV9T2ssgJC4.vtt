00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.540
When we talked about quadratic inequalities, it referred to things called

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.351
critical numbers. These are the numbers that divided up our number line into the

00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:11.103
different intervals that we could consider to figure out which ranges of values

00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:15.302
satisfied our inequalities. For quadratic inequalities, we got these numbers

00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:19.586
from factoring and depending on what rational expressions we have that maybe the

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:23.850
case as well. But we can generalize about it. You remember that for quadratic

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.946
inequalities, we found our critical values by figuring out which values of x

00:00:27.946 --> 00:00:32.107
would cause the quadratic expression to equal 0. And we basically have the same

00:00:32.107 --> 00:00:35.703
requirement for rational inequalities except that this time, we have one

00:00:35.703 --> 00:00:39.984
polynomial divided by another polynomial. So, you have two different sources of

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:44.239
critical numbers. In either case, whether we're talking about the numerator or

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.271
the denominator, we'll come up with a critical value for every value of x that

00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:52.509
will make either one of those 0. Considering this method for finding critical

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:56.730
numbers, what critical numbers do you find for this inequality that we were just

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.144
talking about? If you happen to find more than one critical number, then please

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:02.556
separate them by commas.
