00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.200
But with so many patterns, how do we choose a pattern? So

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.970
this is a possible approach that you can follow. First of all, you

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.140
want to make sure that you understand your design context. You understand

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.800
what you're designing and what are the issues involved with this design. What

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.200
are the problems that you need to solve. At this point, you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.160
can examine the patterns catalog, or,if

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.750
you're already familiar with the catalog, just

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.430
think about the possible patterns that you could use. Once you identify

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.440
the patterns that you can use, you also want to study them and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.090
study the related patterns. So normally if you look at any pattern catalog,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.229
for each pattern there will also be a list of related patterns. So

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.010
you can also look at those to see whether maybe some of those

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.370
might be more applicable. And finally, once you identify the pattern that you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.360
think is appropriate, you will apply that pattern. When you do that, just

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.850
be mindful that there are pitfalls in the use of patterns. One obvious

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.490
one is the fact that you might select the wrong pattern and make

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.460
your design worse instead of better. The second one is that if you

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.560
get too excited about patterns, then you

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.850
might be abusing patterns, so just using too

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.370
many patterns, and end up with a design

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.980
that is more complicated rather than less complicated.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.890
So always be careful, spend the time to figure out which one is the right

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.577
pattern to apply, and make sure that you

00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:05.190
don't use patterns that you don't actually need.
