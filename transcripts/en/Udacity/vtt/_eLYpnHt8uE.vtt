00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.056
Now, one important little gotcha here, which I'm sure didn't actually fall

00:00:04.056 --> 00:00:07.436
through your example, was the calling of this dot world dot clear forces every

00:00:07.436 --> 00:00:12.970
frame. Now this is an important point in our physics engine implentation.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.593
Typically, in a physics engine, you'd set the velocity, toss around some

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:19.309
objects and be on with your day. The reason for this is that box 2D assumes

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:22.573
that you're in a two dimensional environment with the gravity vector always

00:00:22.573 --> 00:00:27.011
pointing down. As such if you were to create an object and throw it through the

00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:31.683
world, the gravity forces on it would actually move it downward. However in

00:00:31.683 --> 00:00:35.258
grids this is not the correct policy. What we'd like to do is for a projectile

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:40.410
to move forward along a straight path without vertical gravity influencing it.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.262
However, because we're a top down game and don't have a gravity vector, any

00:00:43.262 --> 00:00:46.390
small velocity vector gets accumulated on our physics object each frame without

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.316
friction allowing it to continue bouncing around in the environment. Or rather,

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:54.826
you should think of gravity as something that produces friction on an object,

00:00:54.826 --> 00:00:59.132
slowing its velocity. We fixed this sort of gliding, hockey puck motion by

00:00:59.132 --> 00:01:03.628
reducing the influence of the physics engine on our world. Namely, we allowed

00:01:03.628 --> 00:01:06.556
the velocity of an object to be set for a given frame, the physics engine to

00:01:06.556 --> 00:01:11.555
move that object and compute the position and rotation and collisions. And at

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:15.328
the end of the frame, we erase and remove that velocity vector. Now unless we

00:01:15.328 --> 00:01:18.160
reapply a velocity vector to the next frame, the object will sit in this

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.940
position not moving.
