00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.090
So far we've been focusing
on defending ourselves, but

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.910
we know that the attacks
come from malicious actors.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.840
Are there ways that allow us to go
after these malicious actors and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.290
have consequences for them?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.800
Well, one way to do that is to have laws
that govern illegal online activity.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.090
In this lesson, we're going to talk
about cyber laws that address these and

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.720
some of the issues that are related
to intellectual property and

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.850
its protection.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.960
And then we're going to talk about,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.960
what is considered ethical behavior
when it comes to our online activities?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.420
In the second half of the lesson,
we're going to focus on online privacy.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.167
In particular, we're going to address,

00:00:45.167 --> 00:00:49.834
how information about our online
activities can be captured by others?

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:51.950
How can they use it?

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.110
Who can they share it with?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.960
And, what kind of options do we have
in controlling each one of these?
