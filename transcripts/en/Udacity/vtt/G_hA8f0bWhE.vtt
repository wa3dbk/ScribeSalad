00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:04.370
So far, you added a record button
that is perfectly centered on screen,

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.870
on both an iPhone and an iPad.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.170
This is in the view of
the viewController.swift class.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.940
Now we need a way to connect
the record button to the code

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.920
in the view controller.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.810
Since we need to work with both the view
and the view controller at the same

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.240
time, we need a way to show them
both simultaneously in Xcode.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.280
There's a great way to do this in
Xcode called the assistant editor.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.300
To switch to it, first make sure that
we've selected the main.storyboard file

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.230
as you can see here, and
it's showing in the content editor.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.890
Then click the assistant editor
button here on the top right.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.000
It's the one that looks like
two circles, intertwined.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.690
Then, make sure that we have
the view controller selected here.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.420
Things are getting a bit
crowded in our Xcode window.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.100
Let's close out
the inspectors window for

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.140
now with the key shortcut, Cmd+Opt+0.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.170
Let's also hide the debug area for now
by pressing the button here to hide it.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.080
We're going to use something called
an ib action to link the button

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.370
to the view controller.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.780
It links to pressing of the button to
a function inside the view controller.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.130
This is known as a target action.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.120
The target is the view controller, and

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.930
the action is the function
we are about to create.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.510
Select the record button.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.580
You can do it here in
the document outline and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.620
then holding down the Ctrl key, drag
it over until it's right above the last

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.562
curly brace inside
the ViewController.swift file.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.510
Let go and then from the drop down,
select Action.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.170
Let's give this action a name,
such as recordAudio.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.630
And then click the Connect button.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.387
You can see Xcode has created
a function for us called recordAudio,

00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:45.610
and has connected this button to this
function in the viewController class.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.510
We can see this function is connected
because it has this filled in circle

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.190
here on the left side of the bar.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.480
This filled in circle indicates that
this is a special type of function,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.220
called an IB action, that has a button
or other UI element connected to it.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.460
Now every time the user
presses the record button,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.770
this function is going to get called.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.280
A good practice in software development
is to test your code often.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.710
Our pitch perfect app is no exception.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.860
Let's add a line of what I like to call
caveman debugging to this function,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.720
to print out to the console
that the button was pressed.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.150
Inside this function let's
add a print command.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.150
So that we can just print out,

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.170
record button was pressed,
every time the user presses this button.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.330
Let's press the run button and
test this app out.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.599
In my case I've selected the iPhone
6S as the simulator to use.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.210
Now when I press the record button,

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.260
I can see the record button
pressed is showing in the console.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.370
Press it again,
I can see that it's happening there.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.750
It's listing here on the right.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.040
Why do i call it caveman debugging?

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.060
Well, it's the oldest and
simplest form of debugging your code,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.510
just by logging
something to the console.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.600
Later in these courses, you're going to
learn some really powerful ways to

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.060
watch, debug, and
step into the execution of your code.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.040
For now, we can be content
with using caveman debugging

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.650
to ensure that the record audio
function is getting called.
