00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.378
Multiplying x squared in this function, by a number greater than 1, makes it

00:00:04.378 --> 00:00:09.838
grow taller. So this is a vertical stretch. We can see this happening here in

00:00:09.838 --> 00:00:14.350
the equation y equals 2 x squared. On the graph of y equals x squared we get

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.480
the point 2, 4, but on the graph of y equals 2 x squared, we got the point 2,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.060
8. It's not quite on our graph but you can tell this has been stretched upward

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.040
by a factor of 2. This graph is taller than this one. Now on the other hand, if

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.636
we multiply x squared instead by a number that is still positive but is less

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:39.212
than one, then the graph will be vertically shrunk. Like this graph, y equals 1

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:44.910
half x squared. Here instead of the 0.24 that we see on this graph, we have the

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.879
0.2,2. It's only half as tall.
