00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.774
While this engagement ratio certainly tells us something about your engagement,

00:00:04.774 --> 00:00:09.196
there are a few flaws as with any operational definition and method of measuring

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:13.470
a construct, in this case the construct of engagement. For example, what if you

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.452
logged on and were watching lessons, but then your friend called. And so, you

00:00:17.452 --> 00:00:21.635
spent an hour talking to her while the videos continued to play. Or sure, you

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:26.717
can come up with a few flaws in using this as the sole measure in engagement.

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:31.566
So, here's another option. You could self report how engaged you are on a scale

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:36.315
from one to ten. Since engagement doesn't necessarily equal learning, I'll also

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:40.419
ask you how much you feel like you're learning on a scale from one to ten. So,

00:00:40.419 --> 00:00:44.907
go ahead and tell me how you'd rank your engagement and learning by clicking the

00:00:44.907 --> 00:00:49.124
link below. When you're done, just click Yes. The purpose of this quiz is just

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:53.204
to make sure the video is paused. Giving you enough time to click the link and

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:54.993
rate your engagement and learning.
