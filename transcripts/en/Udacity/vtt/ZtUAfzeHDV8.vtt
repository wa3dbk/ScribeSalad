00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.811
It turns out that it depends. Let's see why. We saw earlier that Carnival

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:09.566
charges $10 for a registration fee, and $10 per hour for renting the car.

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:14.612
Rent-a-car charges $30 for a registration fee, and $6 per hour, or x, that we

00:00:14.612 --> 00:00:19.247
rent the car. This would be the total cost. Let's see a table of values and

00:00:19.247 --> 00:00:23.688
these two equations graphs. Here are our two equations and the lines for our

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:28.089
graph. And here's a table of values. X was the number of hours of renting the

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.436
car, and this y represents the cost for a Carnival car rental. The second y

00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:37.150
represents the cost for a Rent-a-Car, car rental. We can see at one hour, that

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.363
Rent-a-car cost more than Carnival. We also see that on the graph. Rent-a-car

00:00:42.363 --> 00:00:47.347
cost $36, and Carnival costs $20. In this region of the graph, we can see that

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:52.660
Carnival is the better option. It's cheaper, or the costs, the y value, is below

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.222
that of Rent-a-car. But, we can see at other times, like 7 hours, that

00:00:57.222 --> 00:01:02.319
Rent-a-Car is the better option. It's cheaper. We also see that on our graph.

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:07.584
Rent-a-car cost $72, and Carnival cost $80. So, it depends. Carnival is usually

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:12.666
better for the shorter car rentals, and Rent-a-Car is better for the longer car

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:13.315
rentals.
