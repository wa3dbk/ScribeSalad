00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:04.420
Let's do another quiz on locality
this time about spacial locality.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.120
If we have the same code as in
the previous quiz, and the question now

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.790
is which of these memory locations
has spacial locality in this code?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.180
Check all of those that do.
