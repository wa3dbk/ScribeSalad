Before we go too much further, I want to teach you a quick little Python thing

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about how to do string substitution.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This will make generating our HTML a little bit more convenient.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If we have a string in Python that's represented like this.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is a string that will probably be returning something like this in our web app--

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
you know--a little bit HTML with some contents.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If we want to return a lot of different types of bold contents with different text,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it's a pain because we have to make this whole string everytime.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Instead we can do something like this.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, so here we have the same structure of the string.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We still have got our <b>tags for bold,</b>

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but I've replaced the contents with this %s,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and what this does is if we follow the string with a % sign and then a variable,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
it will substitute the contents of this variable for %s.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So if this were instead a, and a = "some bold text",

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
when we print this string, when we print "<b>%s</b> % a",

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we'll actually get output that looks like this,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and this is how it can generate the strings.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So this is really convenient because we could have a function that just substitutes

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
1 variable into a string, and then we don't have to build that string over and over again.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Okay, so time for a quick quiz.
