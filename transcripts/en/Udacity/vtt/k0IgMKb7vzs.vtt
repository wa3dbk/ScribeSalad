00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.130
When performing a t-test, we assume that our data

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.840
is normal. In the wild, you'll often encounter probability distributions.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.390
They're distinctly not normal. They might look like this, or

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.030
like this, or completely different. As you'd imagine, there are

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.640
still statistical tests that we can utilize when our data

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.230
is not normal. Why don't we briefly discuss what you

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.510
might do in situations like this. First off, we should

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.880
have some machinery in place for determining whether or not

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.690
our data is Gaussian in the first place. A crude, inaccurate

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.820
way of determining whether or not our data is normal is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.990
simply to plot a histogram of our data and ask, does

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.690
this look like a bell curve? In both of these cases, the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.910
answer would definitely be no. But, we can do a little

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.100
bit better than that. There are some statistical tests that we

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.520
can use to measure the likelihood that a sample is drawn

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.820
from a normally distributed population. One such test is the shapiro-wilk test.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.310
I don't want to go into great depth with

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.210
regards to the theory behind this test, but I do

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.040
want to let you know that it's implemented in scipy.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.740
You can call it really easily like this. W and

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.860
P are going to be equal to scipy.stats.shapiro data, where

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.630
our data here is just an array, or list containing

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.680
all of our data points. This function's going to return these

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.140
two values. The first, W is the Shapiro-Wilk Test statistic.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.710
The second value in this two-pole is going

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.870
to be our P value, which should be interpreted

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.400
in the same way that we would interpret

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.420
the p-value for our t-test. That is, given the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.850
null hypothesis that this data is drawn from

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.290
a normal distribution, what is the likelihood that we

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.370
would observe a value of W that was at least as extreme as the one that we see?
