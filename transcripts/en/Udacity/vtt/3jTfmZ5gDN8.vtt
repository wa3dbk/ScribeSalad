00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.507
Here are the three solutions written in logarithmic form. Nice work, if you got

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:09.071
all three right. Now, some of these were tough, so it's okay if you didn't get

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:13.590
all of them right. Let's walk through each of them. For the first one, we'll

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.040
have our base be 10. And we'll have our answer be 5. When we take the log with

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.738
base 10 of some number, we'll get 5. It means that this number must be a

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:31.812
100000. The log base 10 of a 100000 equals 5. Its the power that we raise 10 to

00:00:31.812 --> 00:00:36.872
in order to get a 100000. For the second one we'll use the same process. We

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:42.110
have a base of 4 so this is the logarithm with a base 4. The result of our

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.540
logarithm equals negative 3. Its the exponent and this is one sixty fourth here

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.380
at the argument for our logarithm. It's the number that we take the logarithm

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.822
of. And finally, for the last one, we use the same technique. Our base of our

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:01.394
logarithm is 2, since this base is 2. The result of our logarithm is x. This is

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:08.766
the exponent. And we're taking log base 2 of the number 3 to get x. Now, keep

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.670
in mind, in this last equation, we weren't really solving for x. We were just

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.360
trying to write this in logarithmic form. It turns out that this number x is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.599
really equal to log base 2 of 3. Now the logarithm in your calculator can't get

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:27.284
this number. The log in your calculator has a base of 10. But there are other

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:31.020
ways to get bases of 2. We won't cover that in this course, but if you're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870
interested, do some research.
