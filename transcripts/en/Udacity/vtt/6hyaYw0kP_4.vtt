00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.374
Okay, so pennants are really great for

00:00:02.374 --> 00:00:05.896
representing collections that
are powers of two in size.

00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:10.131
But a bag needs to be able to
contain any number of elements, so

00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:13.316
how can we use pennants
in order to build bags?

00:00:13.316 --> 00:00:17.781
And it turns out a basic idea from
computer science preschool is what is

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:18.773
going to help us.

00:00:18.773 --> 00:00:22.690
First, I want you to remember a basic
fact about binary arithmetic.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.080
In particular, you can represent any
non-negative integer as a binary string.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.660
So, let's take an integer,
I don't know, how about 23.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.540
How do you write this in binary?

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.070
The answer is 10111.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.556
In base two.

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:41.530
Now each bit position represents
a distinct power of two,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.053
so let's number the bit positions.

00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:47.801
So this bit is 2 to the 0
which is equal to 1.

00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:53.983
The second bit is 2 to the 1 or
2 and we can go on and on and on.

00:00:53.983 --> 00:00:59.278
And notice that 16 plus
4 plus 2 plus 1 is 23.

00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:02.226
Okay.
So, what does this have to do with bags?

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:03.813
Here's a collection of 23 elements.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:06.260
And let's say I want to
throw them in to a bag.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.375
How do I do it?

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:08.118
Here's an idea!

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:10.370
Let's use pennants.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.856
So, you can see what I've done here.

00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:16.736
In the same way that you can take the
integer 23 and write it as a series or

00:01:16.736 --> 00:01:21.456
a sequence of powers of 2, I've taken
the items in the collection and

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:24.028
I've grouped them into powers of 2.

00:01:24.028 --> 00:01:26.593
Now I'm going to need to
connect these in some way.

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:27.758
So to do that,

00:01:27.758 --> 00:01:33.026
I'm going to use an array of pointers
to the roots of each pennant.

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:36.182
And I'll use a null pointer for
the empty bit.

00:01:36.182 --> 00:01:37.949
Now, this array,
I'm going to give a special name.

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:40.457
I'm going to call it a spine.

00:01:40.457 --> 00:01:44.056
So just as a brief recap,
I've taken my collection of elements.

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:47.431
I've broken it up into these
power of two sized pennants.

00:01:47.431 --> 00:01:50.970
And I've connected them together with
this thing that I'm calling a spine
