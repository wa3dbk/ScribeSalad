Another feature of
Android notifications,

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.030
called big view styles,
also work well on Android ware.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.050
On a handheld a user can touch
one of these notifications and

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.180
it will expand to show more information.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.700
On a Android ware device the content
is automatically expanded to fill

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.350
the display, since there is
more vertical space available.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.310
If you look at this code snippet
here you can see the big text style

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.620
being created and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.832
configured here with an edit to the
notification by calling set style here.

00:00:28.832 --> 00:00:31.610
There is also another style called
inbox style that's helpful for

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.640
showing emails as well.
