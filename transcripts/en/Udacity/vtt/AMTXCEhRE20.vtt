00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.740
David's answer was good, but not necessarily optimal. I think he put handle as

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.920
fixed at this particular place in the explanation because the first reason here.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.540
He wanted to capture the notion, that only fixed-handle cups enable drinking.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.245
And that this spot does it. He wanted to capture the notion that only

00:00:18.245 --> 00:00:22.490
fixed-handle cups enable drinking and this scenario does that.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.830
However, this not an optimal way of fixing this particular explanation. However,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.400
this is not the best way of fixing this particular explanation because it leads

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.130
to additional decisions. It suggests that, only those things which have a fixed

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.170
handles are liftable, but of course, from the pail we know, that the pail

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.980
does not have a fixed handle and yet the pail is liftable. This suggests that

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.720
handle is fixed should go somewhere else. Perhaps above, object is liftable, but

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.130
still below object enables drinking. Agent two can figure out that this is

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.780
not the optimal case for putting case as handle as fixed. Because A,

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.070
it voided its notion of pail, a pail is liftable, but has a movable handle.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.450
It also voided this notion of a briefcase. This part was coming from a person of

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.450
a briefcase. The briefcase with removable handle, and it to is liftable. This is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.120
how the agent knows this handle is fixed should go somewhere else, in this

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.340
explanation. Above object is liftable, but beneath object is enables drinking.
