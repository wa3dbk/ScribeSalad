We've drawn a lot of boxes today. But they've all been very flat. What if we

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.900
wanted to make this look more 3-dimensional? I want you to draw this box and

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.510
I'm going to give you a few specifics about its dimensions. This top left

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.760
corner should be at 20,30. This width should be 100. This height should be 40.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.179
This corner should be at 50,10, and this one should be at 150,50.
