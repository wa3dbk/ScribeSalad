00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In mathematics, when an expression gets complicated, we can add parenthesis

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to show structure or grouping--(x - 3) x 5 is different than x - (3 x 5).

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Python regular expressions have similar parenthesis,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but they're written a litttle differently.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The closing parenthesis looks just the same,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but the opening parenthesis--the version you'll be using in this class--is 3 characters--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(?: ).

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's a simple example.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This regular expression makes a group around xyz and then this whole thing

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
can be repeated 1 or more times,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so some strings are xyz, xyzxyz, and so on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Suppose we want to find words made up of combinations of musical notes.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In Western music, the notes are often given names--do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti--

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and you could put them together in various combinations--re, fa, fa--do, do, re--

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
stuff like that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Let's say we want to recognize words that are made up of these syllables in order,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or these syllables not in order but in any combination.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we set out to try it.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We can have a bunch of do's or a bunch of re's or a bunch of mi's.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Let's say we're looking for all of the matching strings in mimi, rere, midore, doo-wop,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and we want to see which ones we get.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We'd like to get mimi as 1, rere as another, midore, and then maybe do,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
just sort of as a corner case,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
but mostly these 3,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but we will be unpleasantly surprised.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
We would really expect something like mi+ to get mimi.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Maximum munch rule, why have you betrayed us?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you look over here, you'll see that actually everyone of these little musical syllables--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
'mi', 'mi', 're', 're', 'mi', 'do', 're'--seem to come out separately.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Why? Well, if you think about it, in the regular expression 'mi+",

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the plus only effects the "i", so really this is getting mi, mii, miii--

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
an entire virtue of selfishness--rather than the thing that we wanted.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You can actually see this over here at the end where do+ got us doo from doo-wop.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So here, the + isn't applying to the right thing, isn't binding correctly.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This isn't quite the right way to do it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This, however, is.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Note our use of the parenthesis in regular expressions--

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(?:--marks the beginning of such a group--),

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and then here in the middle we have do/re/mi.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Anything inside this group can be repeated 1 or more times.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This gets us just the answer we were looking for.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
For a more thorough investigation of musical notes and the associated words,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I recommend The Sound of Music,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but it's also worth pointing out that a very popular computer musical format or interface

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
M-I-D-I--MIDI, the musical instrument digital interface used for recording

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
things like pianos or synthesizers or drum sets, is more or less exactly what we've seen here.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Basically, a list of notes and modifiers and combinations over and over again.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
By contrast, formats like MP3 or other audio compression approaches for recording voice,

00:03:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
do not follow this general pattern, or at least they don't look like they do at first blush.
