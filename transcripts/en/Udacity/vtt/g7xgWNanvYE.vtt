00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.639
Now, this time we have a expression that's a bit more complicated than the past

00:00:03.651 --> 00:00:07.328
few we've seen. However, if we keep in mind our rules that we know for combining

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.967
like terms, that you can only combine terms that have the same variables with

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:14.759
the same powers, then this actually shouldn't be that much harder than the other

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:18.244
one's we've done. So, just give it a try. Write the simplest version of this

00:00:18.256 --> 00:00:19.198
expression that you can in this box over here.
