00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.040
All right,
welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.820
Today, we're going to finish our little
tour of the visual system of the I'm

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.850
sorry, the, of the human visual system.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.920
The anatomy of the human system.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.805
So when we last checked
in with our heroes we had

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:16.075
this little model going on here.

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:17.845
Remember, here's our nose over here.

00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:21.488
Here's your eye, and it's got
the optic nerve going through the sa,

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.305
optic chiasm.

00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:25.625
And it goes to this first area
called the lateral geniculate.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:29.562
And then from the lateral geniculate
most of the stuff goes to the visual

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:33.192
cortex, although some goes to superior
colliculus, which we'll also talk about.

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:34.212
Last time also,

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:37.812
we discussed in some nauseating
detail what goes on in the retina.

00:00:37.812 --> 00:00:41.232
So today is going to be sort of what
goes beyond from above the retina.
