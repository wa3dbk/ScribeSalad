00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.537
So, let me tell you how Hadoop came to be. About

00:00:05.537 --> 00:00:10.200
ten years ago in around 2003, I was working on an Open

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.040
Source web search engine called Nutch, and

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.550
we knew it needed to be something very scalable, because the Web was you know,

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.630
billions of pages. terabytes, petabytes, of data, that we needed

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.340
to be able to process, and we set about, you know, doing the best job we

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.470
could and it was tough. We got things up and running on four or five machines

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.410
not very well, and around that time Google

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.990
published some papers. About how they were doing

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.870
things internally. Published a paper about their distributed

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.980
file system, TFS. and about their processing, framework, MapReduce.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.585
So my partner and I, at the time, in this project, Mike

00:00:57.585 --> 00:01:02.700
Cafarella. Said about trying to reimplement these in Open Source. So that

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.110
more people could use them than just folks at Google. Took us a couple of years,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.020
and we had Nutch up and running on, instead of four or five

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.120
machines, on, 20 to 40 machines. It wasn't perfect,

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.740
it was it wasn't, wasn't totally reliable, but it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.550
worked. And we realize that to get it to the

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.110
point where it was scaled to thousands of machines,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.850
and be as bullet proof as it needed to be,

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.640
would take more than just the two of us,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.210
working part time. Around that time, Yahoo approached me and

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.540
said they were interested in investing in this. So

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.727
I went to work for Yahoo in January of 2006.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.240
First thing I did there, was, we took the parts of Nutch that were a distributed

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.860
computing platform, and put em into a separate

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.880
project. A new project christened Hadoop. Over the

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.370
next couple years, with, Yahoo's help, and the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.670
help of others. we took Hadoop, and really

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.060
got it to the point where it did

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.880
scale to petabytes, and running on thousands of processors.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.510
And doing so quite reliably. it spread to lots of companies. and mostly in the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.240
Internet sector, and became quite a success. after that, we, we started to see

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.580
a bunch of other projects grow up around it. And Hadoop's grown to be the kernel

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.875
of a, which, pretty much an operating system for big data. we've got,

00:02:33.875 --> 00:02:41.373
we've got tools that, allow you to, more easily do, MapReduce programming.

00:02:41.373 --> 00:02:47.658
so, you can develop using SQL or a data flow language called Pig. and

00:02:47.658 --> 00:02:50.026
we've also got the beginnings of

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:54.200
higher-level tools. We've got interactive SQL with

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.930
Impala. We've got Search. and so we're really seeing this develop to being a

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.125
general purpose platform for data processing. that scale's much better and

00:03:06.125 --> 00:03:11.360
that it is much more flexible than anything that's, that's, else is out there.
