00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.150
The third way of estimating company
value is simply to let the market

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.440
decide.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.530
And that's called Market Capitalization.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.460
This is a simple calculation,
Market Capitalization

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.650
is just equal to the number of shares
that are outstanding times the price.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.160
So, in other words,
you can look at the stock market and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.670
see what the current price is and
see how many shares are owned by people.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.580
And it's just one times the other and

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.750
that's the value of the company in
terms of market capitalization.
