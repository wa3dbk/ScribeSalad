00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.400
The vision with a distributed file server is that there is no central server any

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:15.000
more. Each file is distributed across several servers. What does it mean to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.840
avoid the unscalability of a central server? We want to take a file and

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.820
distribute it across several different nodes in

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.810
the local area network. Since the DFS is

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.620
implemented across all the disks in the network,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.700
if a client wants to read or write a

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.750
file then it actually is contacting all the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.960
servers, potentially, to get the data that is looking

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.370
for. And which means that since each file

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.160
is distributed across all of these different servers, the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.590
idle bandwidth that's available cumulatively across all of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.165
these servers can be used to serve the needs

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:55.100
of every individual client. Also, this allows

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.240
distributing the management of the metadata that

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.460
is associated with the files among the

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.480
server nodes that are available. Furthermore, we have

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.270
more memories available in all of these

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.090
servers cumulatively, which means that we have a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.890
bigger. Memory footprint available for implementing a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.680
file cache, including all of the server memories,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.570
plus the memories that may be there in the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.700
clients as well. And that's where we can actually

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.680
go towards cooperative caching among the clients as well.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.890
So, in the extreme, we can treat all the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.290
nodes in the cluster, whether we call them. S1 or c1, we can look at all of the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.300
nodes and say, they're all the same with interchangeable

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.860
roles as clients or servers. That is, we can actually

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.810
make this DFS a serverless file system. If we allow

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.520
the responsibility of managing the files. Saving the files, cashing

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.140
the files, equally distributed among all the nodes of the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.730
class here so the nodes are interchangeable between clients and servers.
