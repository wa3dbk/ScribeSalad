00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.890
Since the fetch weather task is in the fragment, the

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.930
menu option to trigger that task should be inside the fragment

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.320
too. That means we should create a new menu layout

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.390
for the fragment and we'll call it forecastfragment.xml. The file will

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.770
live within the menu folder under the Resources directory. Inside

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.200
that file, we'll declare the new menu option for refresh and

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.140
give it this menu item ID. We'll also need to define

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.290
a string label for this word, Refresh. We're taking this one

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.440
step at a time, so just make the menu xml

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.250
file change in this exercise. If you compile and run

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.060
the app, there'll be no visible change. It won't show

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.500
up on the device yet because we haven't inflated the menu

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.270
item. Inflating it will be in the coding test after

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.550
this. See how the menu main.xml is implemented as an

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.860
example. For an additional hint, see the menu training guide

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.150
below. When you're done, you can click on this box here.
