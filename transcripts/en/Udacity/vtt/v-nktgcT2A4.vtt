00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's my solution to this quiz.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We first add this link

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that was passed in as a parameter to our links list.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And then we add it to our index by saying link.id=link

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
into the global index here.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And let's go ahead and give this function a test.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The first thing we need to do is create a link, so I'll do that now.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So we create a new link, and it's going to have id 50.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then we needed a user id, a submission time, and number of votes,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
which we'll just set to 1 for now.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It needs a title and a URL.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So that should make a link.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And now let's actually call our function add new link L.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And now, let's make sure it works.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So the first thing I want to do is make sure we added it to the list link.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we're going to say print links negative 1,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Which will print the last element in our list of links.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And that's where this link should be

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because we appended it to that list.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I'm also going to print link by id 50.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So these should actually print the same thing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and they should both be our new list--or our new link.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's go ahead and give that a shot.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Ta-da! All right, so we've updated our list,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and we've updated our index--pretty cool.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So as you can see, an index is really handy

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
making reads simpler so you don't have to iterate over the entire list,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
but there's a certain maintenance cost to having them

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
in that you have to keep it up to date when you're updating the rest of your database.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And you can imagine if you had multiple indexes on your table,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which you can,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
every time you insert a new element into your table,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
you need to update all of these indexes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay, great. Let's move on to another quiz.
