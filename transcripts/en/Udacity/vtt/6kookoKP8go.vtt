00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.715
We mentioned logs before, so let's actually use them now. Just like exponents

00:00:04.715 --> 00:00:09.340
have a base, so do logs. If, for example, like in this function we have here,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.505
our exponent has a base of 2, then so does the log that is its inverse. Let's

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:18.790
plug a number in and try something out. We know that for this function, f of 3

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:25.246
is equal to 2 to the 3rd, or just 8. Using logs, this means that log base 2 of

00:00:25.246 --> 00:00:29.576
8 Equals 3. I know this is all very new, so if this sounds confusing or

00:00:29.576 --> 00:00:34.389
unfamiliar, that's not a big deal at all. Don't worry. We'll keep working with

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:38.220
these, and you'll come to understand them very well in a short period of time.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.300
Now, we can see more clearly what's going on here if we rewrite this 8. We can

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.760
instead put 2 to the 3rd there, and this shows what's really happening. We know

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.665
that log base 2 is the inverse of what's happening here. And we can see here

00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:55.795
that it really is undoing what happened to the original 3, that input. With a

00:00:55.795 --> 00:01:00.800
function f, we input 3 and it output 8. When we input that number, the output,

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.831
into the log function, in other words, when we took log base 2 of 8, the output

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:10.630
was the original input. This inverse function, this log function, undid to the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.480
3, what f did to it in the first place. Let's look at this in a different way.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.002
When we input 3 into our exponential function, it spits out 2 to the 3rd. Then

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.656
when we use 2 to the 3rd as the input for the logarithmic function, that's the

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:30.048
inverse of the exponential one The output is three again. Similarly if we use

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:34.206
three as the input for a logarithmic function the exponential function undoes

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:41.176
what the log does. In other words two to the power of log base two of three. Is

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:45.170
equal to 3. This is just confirmed, that these two inverse functions behave

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.357
just like other inverse functions. F of F inverse of X, gives us X and F

00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:57.230
inverse of F of X, gives us X. So, here's a couple for you to try, on your own.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.982
What is Log base 2 of 16? And what is log base two of 64. Giving you a little

00:02:02.982 --> 00:02:08.000
hint for how to think about these, try to rewrite 16 as two, two some power.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What power belongs here? And how does that effect what number goes over here?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.659
Maybe you can think about this one in the same way.
