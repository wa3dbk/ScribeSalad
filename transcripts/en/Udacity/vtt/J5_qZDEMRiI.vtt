00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's my solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I put the strategies into a list because

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we're going to be indexing into that.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I start out in the start state.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Nothing has happened. No points awarded.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Player number 0, that is "Player A,"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is the player to move. Then I repeat this loop.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Tell me everything I know about the current state.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If the score of the player whose turn it is,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is greater than the goal, then that player wins.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Player 0" or "Player 1"--"A" or "B."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Same if the other player is greater than the goal,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
then that player wins and, otherwise, I pick out the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
strategy function for the player to play.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If "P" is "0," then strategy "0" is "A."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If "P" is "1," then strategy "1" is "B."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Apply that strategy function to the state

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and if it's whole, I apply the hold action to the state to get a new state.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Otherwise, I assume that the strategy function is legal,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and if it doesn't return whole, then it does return roll.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'll give it the benefit of the doubt there, and perform the roll action

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
on the state and on a random integer from 1 to 6, inclusive.

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
That will give me the new state, and I continue until we find a winner.
