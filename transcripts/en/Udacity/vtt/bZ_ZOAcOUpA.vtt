00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.500
Material design says that motion
design can effectively guide

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.240
the user's attention in ways
that both inform and delight.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.240
Use motion to smoothly transport
users between navigational contexts.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.360
Explain changes in the arrangement
of elements on a screen.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.420
And reinforce element hierarchy.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.600
We aren't really doing that yet.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.710
But we can add something that does,
a shared element transition.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.590
When we talk about shared elements,
we're really talking about Android

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.710
views that contain content that is
shared between two different activities.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.720
We animate the transition between
the activities by moving and

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.090
scaling the element into place,
which draws the eye to the element and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.730
creates continuity between
the two activities.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.760
It's relatively easy to add a shared
element to the transition we've

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.130
already created.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.550
We first need to tell Android which
views in both activities are paired up.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.360
We start by adding a transition name
to the view in the destination layout.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.910
We'll also want to add a transition
name to any view that we're

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.470
transitioning from.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.650
So that the system can find it again in
case it has to tear down the activity,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.750
thanks to rotating the device or
some other hardware change.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.030
If the shared view is filled out
when the activity is first created,

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.660
that's all we'd have to do.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.070
However, many activities do
things like create a fragment and

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.030
then need to go to the database
to fetch the shared element.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.080
Both of which typically involve
asynchronous tasks, and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.140
we are using best Android practices.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.470
We also want to wait for
any layout to be complete.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.800
Fortunately there's a solution for that.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.580
We can ask Android to wait
before beginning the transition

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.610
using supportPostponeEnterTransition.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.440
And tell it we're ready by using
supportStartPostponedEnterTransition.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.280
We have to a bit careful here
about how long we postpone things,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.960
as we've pretty much stopped
the world in motion when we do this.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.089
I.e., going out to the network while
we postpone things isn't going to

00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:54.558
work well.

00:01:54.558 --> 00:01:59.220
Since I try very hard to keep
display-related logic in layouts,

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.890
I'm going to create an attribute to
enable postponing the enter transition

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.600
in forecast fragment.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.150
I then read the attribute
in the onInflate method.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.840
For the detail fragment,
I'll add a flag as an argument and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.610
read it during the onCreateView method.
