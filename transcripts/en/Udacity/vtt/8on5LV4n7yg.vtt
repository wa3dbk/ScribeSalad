00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.100
Now let's look at this whole additional
concept of finding panoramas.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.010
One of the restrictions of the way
we've talked about panoramas so

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.200
far has been that you have to
take a sequence of pictures,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.900
panning left to right and
in different formats.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.610
&gt;&gt; Well, that sound rather restrictive.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.820
So, what we want to be able to do is
kind of find these panoramas from

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.500
a collection of pictures.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.470
This actually also has been studied,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.060
basic idea is that we want to be able to
find similar you know, find images from,

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.120
and run RANSAC and find the most
similar types of these patches, and

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.870
say okay, these two images
are the most closest to each other.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.020
Let's actually build
a panorama on this one.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.890
Similarly, find another region that
might have you know, similarities and

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.380
use that, and keep going that way, and
third one, of course, would be again,

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.970
similar ones, and in essence,
what we do is we will use RANSAC and

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.250
other types of matching techniques,
we can find images that are next to each

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.780
other and
we use that to form a panorama.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.920
So we don't really have to worry
about taking pictures in a sequence.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.320
This was a method proposed by at Brown
and Lowe and actually it's one of

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.010
the papers I would like you to look at
on your own and use that as a method of

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.410
trying to understand how we can actually
do this kind of stuff with taking

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.290
pictures that are not actually just in
sequence but can be taken in any order.
