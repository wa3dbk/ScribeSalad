00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.793
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The answer is y equals negative x squared over 8 plus 4x minus 14. This is

00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:09.941
the only equation that is satisfied by all three of the sets of coordinates that

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:14.889
we saw in our x y table before. And it's the only equation of these equations

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.656
that will fit any point that we pick along this path. Since every point along

00:00:19.656 --> 00:00:24.145
the curve satisfies this equation, this must be the equation that produces this

00:00:24.145 --> 00:00:27.760
curve. Now that's great, except that this equation and this graph both look

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.613
really different from anything we've played with before. It looks like we've got

00:00:31.613 --> 00:00:32.655
some exploring to do.
