00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.990
So we've all used our phones to send out text messages. But sometimes there is a

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.280
need for code to send texts. Consider the

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.360
following. Taxi companies send out text messages to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.730
their passengers informing them of the cab driver's

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.200
location. Dating websites help potential couples communicate with

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.130
each other while using texts, but without sharing

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.520
phone numbers. To make authentication more secure Gmail sends

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.590
its users a security code via text message. This the Gmail user can

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.710
then use in addition to their

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.840
password. Retail organizations communicate daily deals to

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.010
their customers, while using texts. This use case seems important to a lot

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.630
of different companies, but what does it have to do with classes and objects?
