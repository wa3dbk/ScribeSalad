00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.774
This triangle has it's sides in a ratio of 7 to 24 to 25. Great thinking if you

00:00:06.774 --> 00:00:11.519
chose that ratio. We know that sense if we multiply this leg by 5 we would get

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.767
35. And if we multiply the hypotenuse of 25 by 5, we would get a hypotenuse of

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:24.260
125. This means that 5 is the multiplier for our ratio, so to find the missing

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.106
leg, we simply simplify multiply 24 by 5. This gives us a side length of 120

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:31.060
units.
