In this next video,
I will implement objective one,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.689
creating a web page that lists all
the restaurants in the database when

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.664
the user visits localhost
port 8080/restaurants.

00:00:08.664 --> 00:00:11.980
Once you've attempted this challenge,
proceed to the solution video.
