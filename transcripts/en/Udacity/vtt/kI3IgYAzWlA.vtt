00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.190
Let's look at the solution
to our cache summary quiz.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.730
We already know that the least
significant five bits are the offset

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.080
bits, that there are eight blocks
in this cache, and because it's two

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.480
way set associative, that means that
the next two bits are the index bits.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.820
So all of these have
the same index bits,

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.570
which means they map to
the same cache set, so

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
we only really need to consider what
happens in the one set where they go.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.630
This is a load.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.630
It's going to be a mess,
because the cache is empty.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.270
So we have a miss.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.870
Now the valid, dirty, and

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.180
tag bits in the set are going to
be 1 here and 0 here.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.400
Dirty is 0 and the tag is BCDE00.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.090
It's actually going to
have slightly more bits,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.380
but this is the only part that
will really differ between these.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.850
The next axis is CDEF Is
going to be a miss.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.390
And we'll fetch into
the other entry here.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.480
The dirty bit is 0
because this is a load.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.220
Next, we have a store hit
because we are accessing this.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.520
It's a hit because it's a store.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.040
This becomes dirty.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.050
Next we have a store to another
word in the same block.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.440
So this block becomes dirty.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.290
And then we have a store again to BCDE,
so

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.660
it's just a hit that sets
this dirty bit again, to one.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.040
So overall, we have two misses and
zero write backs in this sequence.
