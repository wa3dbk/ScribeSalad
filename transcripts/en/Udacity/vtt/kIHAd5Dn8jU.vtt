00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So in which of these three situations would you expect stiff differential equations--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the motion of a spacecraft around a planet, cloth simulation where you, for instance, simulate

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how one shakes a tablecloth, or a 1-dimensional harmonic

00:00:17.000 --> 09:59:59.000
oscillator, which strictly moves up and down?
