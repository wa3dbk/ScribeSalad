I want you to do your best to order these types of needs into the hierarchy of

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.555
needs. Now the answer won't always be clear, but it might be fun to discuss

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:12.840
your reasoning on the forum with your peers. This will make for a great forum

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.290
topic. We have water, having a satisfying and fulfilling career,

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.850
self-confidence, earning a paycheck, and a happy and secure relationship.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.559
Determine where you think the needs will go on the hierarchy, and then place

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.762
the letter in the corresponding box.
