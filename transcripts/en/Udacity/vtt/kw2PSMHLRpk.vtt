Hi, everyone. Welcome to the review session for this unit.

00:00:02.654 --> 00:00:07.750
In this unit, you've learned how to determine a function and how to recognize it from its graph.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.042
You can also describe the behavior of a function, find the maximum and minimum,

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.907
and determine if it's even or odd.

00:00:14.907 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's check your understanding with a few problems.
