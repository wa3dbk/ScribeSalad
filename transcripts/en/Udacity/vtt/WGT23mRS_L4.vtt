Well, since we've been talking about distances a lot, we might as well find the

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:08.685
length of each side of this new black quadrilateral. This time, however, we're

00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:12.890
just going to use these coordinates of the points that we know. So, what did we

00:00:12.902 --> 00:00:16.950
use before? Well, we used the distance between the x-coordinates, and the

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:21.669
distance between the y-coordinates, squared each of those distances, added them

00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:26.953
together, and then found the positive square root of that quantity. Interesting.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:31.816
So, you can formalize this process for any two points, where one of the points

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:36.831
has the coordinates that I'll call x1 y1,. And the other point has coordinates

00:00:36.843 --> 00:00:41.666
x2 and y2. I want to use these subscripts here because that let's me still show

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:45.376
that these two coordinates are in fact x-coordinates, and these ones are

00:00:45.388 --> 00:00:49.416
y-coordinates, but, that they belong to different points. Now that we have this

00:00:49.428 --> 00:00:53.182
handy formula, for the distance between any two points, we can calculate

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:57.141
distances just knowing coordinates. That means, we don't need to rely on our

00:00:57.153 --> 00:01:00.787
picture anymore. Although, of course, it will be helpful in the future to go

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.721
back and reference it. We know that we can use this formula to calculate the

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.655
distance between any two points, so let's try it for each of the points that

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.596
creates the outline of our black quadrilateral, on the visual that I've now

00:01:12.608 --> 00:01:17.249
conveniently taken away from you. The notation here that we're using is similar

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:22.080
to what we did before. MN, for example, is the distance between M and N, two

00:01:22.092 --> 00:01:26.953
points on our list. You can consider this just two letters that form a single

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:31.805
variable. So, NP is the distance between N and P, PQ is the distance between P

00:01:31.817 --> 00:01:32.807
and Q, and so on.
