00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.327
Hopefully, this gave you a nice little review of polynomial multiplication. I'm

00:00:04.327 --> 00:00:08.630
sure that you remembered exactly how to distribute correctly. When we multiply

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.760
f of x times g of x, or, in other words, x plus 1 times 2x minus 5, we end up

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.934
with 2x squared minus 3x minus 5.
