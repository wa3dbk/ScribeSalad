00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.860
This parabola would open to the left. Great thinking if you got that one right.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.398
One of the key things to recognize is that this equation is in the form x

00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:13.969
equals. Parabolas that are in this form, either open to the left or to the

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:19.312
right. Since the a value is negative 1, we know the parabola will open to the

00:00:19.312 --> 00:00:24.750
left. If I had a different parabola like x equals 3y squared, then we can see

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.740
that, that parabola opens to the right, since the a value here is positive.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.524
Let's take this one away for a moment and just concentrate on the first

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:39.162
parabola. Again, its vertex is at 0,0. This is the turning point for the

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:44.065
parabola. Notice also that there's an axis of symmetry that goes through the

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:48.335
vertex. It means that if there's a point on this side of the graph, then

00:00:48.335 --> 00:00:52.945
directly across from it is another point. For example, we know the point

00:00:52.945 --> 00:00:57.880
negative 4,2 is on the graph. So, we could also know that the point negative 4

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.281
negative 2 is also on the graph. If we zoom in on our parabola, we can also

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:08.380
find other points by moving from the vertex. Since our parabola's in the form,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.490
x equals. This time, we'll move up and down one unit. Next, we'll move a units

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.523
in the x direction to find the two points. So, a is negative 1, so I can go one

00:01:20.523 --> 00:01:25.952
unit up and one unit left. This gives me the point negative 1,1. And if I

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:30.495
want to find another point I can move one unit down and one unit left to get

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:37.715
this point negative 1 negative 1. Let's also see this with this graph. x equals

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:43.640
3y squared. If we zoom in on this purple parabola, we can see how to get these

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.246
points of three one and 3 negative 1. We start at the vertex and go one unit up

00:01:51.246 --> 00:01:56.675
and one unit down, since we're in the form x equals. And this time we're going

00:01:56.675 --> 00:02:01.830
to go three units right since the a value is positive 3. So we'll go one unit

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.032
up and three units right, one unit down and three units right. This gives us

00:02:07.032 --> 00:02:09.800
the other 2 points on our parabola.
