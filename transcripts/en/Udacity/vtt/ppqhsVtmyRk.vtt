00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:11.532
number 10, the carrot symbol, and then 34 to get the exponent. For this last

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:15.562
number in scientific notation, we start by entering the decimal, followed by

00:00:15.562 --> 00:00:19.730
asterisk symbol, and the number 10. Then, we type the carrot key and negative

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.350
sign and 9 to give us our final exponent. I hope you're starting to feel like a

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.933
Math Quill pro if you're getting all these correct.
