00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.629
So we know that we need to change our pieces to 24th's. So I'm going to take my

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:09.501
whole cake and make it into 24th's. I know one whole cake would be 24/24's, but

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:14.080
now I need to change this 1/6 of the cake into 24th's, and the 3/8's into

00:00:14.092 --> 00:00:18.592
24th's. I want to do that because I want to subtract off the pieces that are

00:00:18.604 --> 00:00:22.560
frosted. I want to be left with the unfrosted region. So we know we need to

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:27.705
change 1/6 to 24th's and we need to change 3/8th into 24th's. What number do we

00:00:27.717 --> 00:00:31.810
need to multiply by to change 1/6 and to change 3/8. Go ahead, enter your

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:33.200
numbers here in these boxes.
