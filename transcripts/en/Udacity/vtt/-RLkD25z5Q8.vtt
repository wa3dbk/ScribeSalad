00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.436
Here the solutions are 4 plus or minus the square root of 13. Great work if you

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:09.146
found those answers. Again, we start by moving this constant term to the right

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:15.235
side of our equation. So, we have x square, minus 8x equals negative 3. Next,

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:17.935
we want to add the same amount to both sides of our equation, so that we can

00:00:17.935 --> 00:00:24.140
complete the square. Our b is negative 8. So, b over 2 squared equals positive

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.930
16. We add that amount to both sides, and then we rewrite the left hand side of

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.850
our equation using x minus 4 squared. Now that we have a perfect square, we

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.014
take the square root of both sides. To get x minus 4 is equal to plus or minus

00:00:38.014 --> 00:00:43.503
root 13. We add four to both sides to get x by itself, so 1x is equal to 4 plus

00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:47.513
or minus the square root of 13.
