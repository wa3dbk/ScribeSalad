00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This exercise involves doubling in the games of Pig. What is doubling?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you're familiar with the game of backgammon, which is a gambling game with dice,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
doubling is a way to end the game early.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And the idea is that when we start out, each game is worth 1 point.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But in the course of the game, if 1 player is winning,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then he can propose to double the stakes of the game

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so that it's worth 2 points--that it, say, costs $2 that the winner wins from the loser

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
rather than $1 or â‚Ź2 or whatever currency we're playing with.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then when the player makes that move of doubling,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
then the opponent has a choice.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He must immediately either accept or decline.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If the opponent accepts, then we play the game and it's worth 2 points.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If the opponent declines, then the proposer of the double immediately wins 1

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and the game is over.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In backgammon, doubling can go on infinitely from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 to 16 and so on.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For Pig we're only going to allow 1 round of doubling.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So the game is going to start off being worth 1 point

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and can go up to 2 points but no more than that.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So we're going to define a whole new game.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The top level function will be called play<u>pig</u>d--d for double--

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and all our functions will end in that d.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A state in this game will be just like before, with 1 new value for the doubling amount.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So a state will have the player to play, the score for me, the score for you,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the pending score, and an extra field for the double.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And the double can either be 1 or 2--

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and we said we're not going to allow it to go higher than that--

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
or it can be the string double.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It takes that value only at 1 point during the game.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
When the first player proposes a double and then the second player has the choice

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
of accept or decline, that player will see double in the state field

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then will have to reply.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So what I want you to do is write these 2 functions: pig<u>actions</u>d,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
which takes a state and returns all the legal actions from that state,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and here's the description of what they can be;

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and I want you to define some strategy function, strategy_d,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that gives a state which is a state in the doubling Pig game

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and returns a good action.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What do I mean by good?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's got to be better than this strategy function, hold<u>20</u>d,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
which holds at 20 and always accepts when offers a double,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
never doubles, and holds it at 20 or rolls otherwise.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You should define a strategy that's better than that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
If you want, you can try to define the optimal strategy, but you're not required to do that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I have defined for you the main function, play<u>pig</u>d.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's similar to what we had before,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
except the result that's returned is 2 values now--

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
both the winning strategy and the value of the game, which will be either 1 or 2.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And then the other difference is we got rid of the roll and hold functions,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and now we replaced it with just 1 do function, which takes an action and a state

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and it passes along the die rolls and then does that action.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So this is really the definition of how the game works

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
where the actions can be rolling, holding, doubling, declining, and accepting.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Then die rolls are as before.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We define the clueless function, which just takes a random choice

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
from among the legal actions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You should definitely be able to beat that,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but you've also got to be able to beat the whole 20 strategy.
