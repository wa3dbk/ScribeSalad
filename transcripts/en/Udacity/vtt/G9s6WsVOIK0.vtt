00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.373
Here's our fifth and final problem for exponential equations. We have 16 raised

00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:09.879
to the 2x plus 1, equal to 64 raised to the x plus 3. Notice that 2x plus 1 is

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:19.120
our entire exponent, and x plus 3 is our entire exponent. What do you think x

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.680
equals in this case?
