00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:05.470
So the answer is, at this point, x references the object 3 which is an integer.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.489
So it has type int. After the next assignment, now x references the string,

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:14.836
hello udacious one, which has type str. At this point, while we're inside the

00:00:14.836 --> 00:00:19.252
definition of the function double, double takes a parameter named x. Note that

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:23.998
this is a different x from that x. This x is defined inside the body of the

00:00:23.998 --> 00:00:28.740
double procedure. This one is visible outside it. We don't actually know what

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.126
object this x references yet. It doesn't reference as an object until we call

00:00:33.126 --> 00:00:37.672
double and pass in a value. So its value is actually unknown. So at this point,

00:00:37.672 --> 00:00:41.820
the object x with references unknown and the type of x is also unknown, but

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.098
importantly, this is a different x from that one. The type of that x is still

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:52.345
type str. After the last assignment and I didn't make this part of the quiz, the

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:56.815
type of x is now type function. And the point of this quiz is to illustrate that

00:00:56.815 --> 00:01:01.076
Pythons types are dynamic. And the real emphasis of that is the fact that the

00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:05.492
type of x at this point could be unknown. We can define a function, have a

00:01:05.492 --> 00:01:09.573
variable named x. It doesn't have a type until it's associated with an object.
