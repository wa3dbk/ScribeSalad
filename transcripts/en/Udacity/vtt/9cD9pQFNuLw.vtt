00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.950
We're providing you with an asset drop,
view the link below,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.980
so that you can download the images
and include them in the app.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.280
When we open up the assets ZIP file,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.190
we see that the same icon
is provided at different sizes

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.898
for different resolutions.
In the drawable MDPI folder,

00:00:14.898 --> 00:00:18.348
we see the assets that will be used
on an MDPI device.

00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:20.932
In the drawable HDPI folder,
we see the assets

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:25.463
that will be used on an HDPI device.
And the same goes for the other folders.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.226
Under the res directory copy over

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:31.060
all the asset folders
provided in the download.

00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:35.876
Clicking on an image shows a preview of it
and the size and pixels is also shown.

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:40.092
At this time you can also remove
the old placeholder ic launcher icons.

00:00:40.378 --> 00:00:43.862
Our new launcher icons
are located in mipmap folders.

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:46.470
These are distinct folders
from the drawable folders.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.610
If you build an APK
for a target screen resolution like HDPI,

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.340
the Android asset packaging tool, AAPT,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.440
can strip out the drawables
for other resolutions you don't need.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.440
But if it's in the mipmap folders,
then these assets will stay in the APK

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.381
regardless of the target resolution.

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:04.810
But when would you need
an image at a resolution

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.790
different than the resolution
of the device?

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.010
Well, one example
is the Android launcher app,

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.520
which controls the home screen
as well as the All App store.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.051
The launcher app won't use the icon
at the current density of the device,

00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:19.874
but rather pulls an icon
for the next highest resolution up.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:23.455
For an XXHDPI device like the Nexus 5,

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:27.691
normally the assets will be pulled
from the drawable XXHDPI folder.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.963
However, in this case the launcher icon
will pull the XXXHDPI version

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:34.452
of the launcher icon.

00:01:34.644 --> 00:01:38.879
That will make the larger app icons
appear sharper on the all apps screen.

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:44.413
In the code replace @drawable/ic<u>launcher
with @mipmap/ic</u>launcher

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.907
because of the new location of the icons.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.828
For the rest of the icons
modify the forecast list

00:01:49.828 --> 00:01:53.160
and the details screen to display
the right weather icon

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.945
instead of the placeholder one.

00:01:55.045 --> 00:01:57.131
See the hints below
in the instructor notes.

00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:00.276
Using the helper functions
we've provided in the gist below,

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:03.950
you can map the weather condition code
to the icon that you'll need.

00:02:03.977 --> 00:02:07.064
This is what the app should look like
when you're done with this step.

00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:10.050
Note that there are two types
of each weather icon,

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:12.733
a gray icon and a colored art image.

00:02:12.733 --> 00:02:15.960
In the main forecast list
we'll be using the gray icon.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.650
However, for the today layout,
we'll use the colored icon.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.518
When you go inside the detail activity,
you'll also use the colored icon.

00:02:23.672 --> 00:02:27.160
At this time, you can also remove
any images you hard coded

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.570
into the layout XML, because
they'll be populated dynamically now.
