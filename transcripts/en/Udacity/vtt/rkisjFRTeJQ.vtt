00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.990
So let me tell you what
we're not going to cover.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.830
In exactly the same way we talked about
bag of words for recognition of objects,

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.990
where you cre, you, you have some way of
finding interest points in an image, and

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.030
then you cluster all those
interest points into code words.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.840
Remember that?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.390
And then you describe each image by
its histogram of the code words, and

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.920
then you build a classifier to
recognize these histograms?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.250
Well you can do the same thing in video,
right?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.530
So you can, you can pull out
these little interest points.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.860
This guy is moving, and
his hand is swinging, or over here,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.780
or maybe this car is moving.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.170
And that would build you,
you could extract some features.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.400
But now, remember the volume in video,
your feature points,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.290
your interest points are in space time,
instead of just in space.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.451
And you could pull out little spacetime
patches, sometimes called cuboids, in,

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:54.138
in some of the work, where they're
just these little chunks of spacetime

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:56.708
imagery, and
that builds you your descriptions.

00:00:56.708 --> 00:01:01.230
You can then do feature
quantization to learn codewords.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.020
You do this over all your videos.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.840
Then for an incoming activity, you can
look for the interest points, you can

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.880
build a histogram of these codewords,
and then you can train a classifier.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.230
And here they talk about using
an SVM with a chii squared kernel.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.010
The reason we're not going to talk
about that, although it's good work and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.999
interesting work is, it's in some sense,
only the three dimensional,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.990
from 2dxy to 3dxyt.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.900
It's just the three dimensional
extension of the previous work done on

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.450
bag of words, or
things like bag of words.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.450
Instead, we're going to talk
a little bit today, and then also,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.600
next time, on some representations that
fundamentally are about how things move,

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.370
or about time series.
