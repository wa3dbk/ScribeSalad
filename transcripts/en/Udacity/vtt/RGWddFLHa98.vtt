Trying to learn new things will really help keep the brain healthy. Because the

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.800
more things they do that require new learning, the more neural growth there is.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.635
If you chose this, continuing to practice things I already know, that won't

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:15.820
hurt. It'll make the neural connections stronger. Drinking a lot of alcohol is

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.800
not a good choice. Staying physically fit is always a good idea. And

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.050
socializing with others, or playing with pets, neither one would hurt. But I

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.250
would say, the most important, would be to try to learn new things. But now

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.689
let's go talk about the different types of intelligence, and how they're

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.500
important in later adult life.
