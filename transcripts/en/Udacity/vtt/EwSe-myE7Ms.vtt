00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
Now let's come back to aesthetics.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:10.140
I mentioned this at the start, and I wanted to see how some two, in particular,

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.010
two classical authors have kind of captured the notion of aesthetics and

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.810
what relationship that might have to software design.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.540
The first is Aquinas.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.200
I won't quote for you the, the Latin but what it, what it boils down to

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.080
is that beauty, elegance, resolve to wholeness, harmony and radiance.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.420
And we can think of that as far as software is concerned as completeness,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.910
consistency and conceptual integrity.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.350
Other quote comes from Pascal,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.850
you may have heard of the Pascal programming language.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
Pascal was a French mathematician, and one of my favorite quotes is he said,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.140
he apologized in a letter saying, sorry I didn't have I would have

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.510
written you a shorter letter, but I didn't have time.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.700
If you think about it for a minute, what this means is it takes a lot of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.120
time and energy to come up with an elegant solution that looks quite simple on

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.329
the surface, but really satisfies the complex requirements.
