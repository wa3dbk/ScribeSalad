00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is 17.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first time we call rec_naive a is 17.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We make one addition and call rec_naive again

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
with 16 as its argument.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We make another addition and call rec_naive with 15 as the argument.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This process continues, doing one addition and another call 14 more times

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
until a = 0, and so we will have made 17 additions.
