00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So the code you had to write was pretty straight forward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Like most decorators, we compute the result here by applying the function to the args,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
then we return the result down here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Maybe a little bit tricky is what's in this finally clause,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which is we're decreasing the trace level.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So the indentation level goes up by 1 every time we enter a new function

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and down by 1 every time we go back.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The issue here is, we want to make sure that we do decrement this.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If we increment this once, and then calling the function results in an error,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and we get thrown out of that error, we want to make sure we put it back where it belongs.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We don't want to mess with something and then not restore it.

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that's why we put this in a try finally.
