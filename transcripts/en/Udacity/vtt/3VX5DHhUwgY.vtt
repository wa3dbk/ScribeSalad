00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.032
Well, there are a number of reasons why we may behave in an altruistic way. So

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:10.142
let's look at a few. One evolutionary theory for altruism is kin selection. And

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:13.814
this refers to the evolutionary pressure for individuals to favor helping those

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:19.810
that are most genetically related to themselves. That is relatives or kin.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.874
Another explanation for altruistic behavior is reciprocal altruism. This is the

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:29.626
idea that we help others in the hope that they will help us in the future. It

00:00:29.626 --> 00:00:33.595
is much easier for us to survive as humans if we can cooperate with each other

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:37.740
and this type of altruism promotes cooperation.
