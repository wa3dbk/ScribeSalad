00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.599
So people who have specific phobias are not necessarily more generally anxious

00:00:03.599 --> 00:00:09.255
than other people. In fact, they're only really afraid of their feared and

00:00:09.255 --> 00:00:13.948
phobic object. But they really do go to great lengths to avoid these phobic

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:20.650
situations or objects. So for instance, someone might be afraid of elevators.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.770
And what that means is that they will go to great lengths to avoid elevators.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.540
So they make sure that their doctor's office or their dentist office or a hotel

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:35.556
room is always on a lower level so they can get to by stairs. Now this

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:40.046
treatment for these situations and these phobias is very fascinating. But we're

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:46.566
going to save that for the next lesson. Now what causes specific phobias? Like

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:50.406
all mental disorders, as it turns out, it's a combination of genetic and

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:55.534
environment factors. So for instance, a person who has a specific phobia very

00:00:55.534 --> 00:01:00.544
often has the genetic disposition. But they also may have low levels of this

00:01:00.544 --> 00:01:06.060
neurotransmitter called GABA. They may have personality disorders like

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.364
narcissism. And finally, they often are exposed to really chronic stressful

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:12.600
situations in their lives.
