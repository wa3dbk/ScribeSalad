00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.612
&gt;&gt; Well if the mean is 60 and the standard deviation is 13, one standard

00:00:05.612 --> 00:00:12.072
deviation below the mean would be 60 minus 13. 60 minus 13 is 47. So here's 60,

00:00:12.072 --> 00:00:18.792
the mean, and we go back 13, and this value is 47. Two standard deviations above

00:00:18.792 --> 00:00:25.075
the mean would be 86, because we go up 13 for one standard deviation and another

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:31.448
13 for two standard deviations. And finally, the mean minus two standard

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:36.025
deviations would be 60 minus 13 minus 13, which is 34.
