My name is Jeffrey Middleton.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.310
I work at Google On Search, specifically in web ranking, which is how we

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.478
decide for a given query what results we're going to show in what order.

00:00:07.478 --> 00:00:10.590
And I have been using git since I first started programming really for

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.460
about six years.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.090
So for me, the biggest useful thing about version control is when I'm working on

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.250
something bigger on my own.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.770
If I'm just doing a small task,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.870
it's kind of okay to be able to do it without any, without any version control.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.420
I can just sit there, do the little thing and be done with it.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.750
But if it's something bigger I really like to be able to break it

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.810
up into pieces, to kind of think about my work in terms of a bunch of steps, and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.070
to be able to fix all of my mistakes by moving forward and backward.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.120
And kind of get everything together in the right way before I'm,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.710
before I'm really ready to share it with other people.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.430
The learning curve with version control really varies a lot depending on

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.240
what you're using.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.570
I think some systems that don't offer as much are really fast to pick up, but

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.550
then more complex version control systems like git.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.220
There is a pretty steep learning curve, but

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.890
I think it's worth it because the power is so great, and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.260
once, once you do learn it, once you get past the curve you can really do a lot.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.980
And it's things that you couldn't do without having learned that much.
