00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.538
And now for the answer.

00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, we can find this out by ourselves simply by running this in the IDE.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here is our input: I click on Run

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you can see that the binary search simplification

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
does not simplify as much as one could imagine.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
In the beginning we had this 20-character string,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which would then be reduced to this 10-character string

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
just by splitting this in half

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and now if we split this again into two 5-character strings,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
none of the two halves will actually contain a select tag.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So both will pass,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and therefore we'll stick with the original string,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which in this case simply then is followed by "fo."

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, for the quiz, 'fo' is the correct answer.
