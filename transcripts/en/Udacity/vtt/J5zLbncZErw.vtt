00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.195
It takes the boat 6 hours to go downstream so we know what this corresponding

00:00:04.195 --> 00:00:08.720
time must be 6. We know the speed of the boat going downstream is faster with a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.622
current so we'll have the speed of the boat, which is x. And then we'll add the

00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:17.495
current which is 12. The return trip for the boat is going to be 8 hours so for

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:22.484
upstream or going against the current we'll have eight for the time. The speed

00:00:22.484 --> 00:00:26.839
of the boat against the current will be x minus 12. We'll have the speed of the

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.493
boat which is x and then we'll have to subtract off the current speed which is

00:00:30.493 --> 00:00:36.251
12. And here's what's different about this problem. We don't know the distances

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:41.019
going upstream or downstream. We'll need expressions for each of these. The

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.764
distance is equal to rate times time. So when going upstream the boat's

00:00:45.764 --> 00:00:51.984
distance would be x minus 12, the rate times 8, the time. And when going

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:57.834
downstream we'll have the rate x plus 12 times the time which is 6. This is our

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:02.013
complete table with all the information we need. And if we want we go ahead and

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:06.748
simplify each of these expressions. When we distribute the eight, we'll have 8x

00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:12.598
minus 96 for the first one. And we distribute the six, we'll have 6x plus 72

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:14.179
here.
