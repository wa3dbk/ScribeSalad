Here are the bugs. Where does the term "bug" come from?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
There's a story of a Harvard Mark II machine in which

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
on September 9, 1947, a moth got stuck in the relay.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The moth got carbonized and then caused a short circuit in the machine,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which caused the machine to break.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Technicians retrieved the moth from the relay and this was then recorded

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as the first bug actually being found in a computer.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The bug is now on display at the Smithsonian in Washington.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The term "bug" as you can see was already known in 1947, and it's actually much older than that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can even trace it back to Shakespeare who used the term in order to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
describe some form of spector sitting on the chest of people in the night and causing them nightmares.
