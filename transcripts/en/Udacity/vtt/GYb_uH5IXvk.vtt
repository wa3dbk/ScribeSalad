00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.935
To understand what this metric means,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:04.960
inter-selection time, let's examine some plots.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.020
Let's create a plot of the airhead inter-selection time.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.750
Each point represents the event of an airhead being selected.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.309
For example, this point represents the tenth time an airhead was chosen.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.740
The y axis value is the number of turns since the last time

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.780
someone selected an airhead.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.720
Thus higher values represents lower demand.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.460
This metric seems promising as a way to capture popularity.
