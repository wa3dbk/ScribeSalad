00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.680
There's a couple more things about
Android Build Variants that you should

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.370
know about, but you won't necessarily
need to use them very often.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.650
Consider a game that contains
a great deal of drawable resources.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.160
So many in fact that including
all the drawables for

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.910
every resolution would result
in an unacceptably large APK.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.840
This would be an excellent time to use
product flavors, one for medium DPI and

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.480
one for high DPI.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.310
Now, consider what happens if we
want to add free and paid flavors.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.730
You'll want both a free and
paid medium DPI version, and a free and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.440
paid high DPI version.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.750
This comes out to four total flavors.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.720
However, now if you want to include
additional functionality in

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.630
the paid version, for example,
you have to put it in two places.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.140
One for the paid medium DPI and
one for the paid high DPI.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.050
Now, suddenly we've lost all
the code release advantages of

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.310
using flavors in the first place.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.140
Fortunately, the Android plug-in
supports the concept of flavor

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.500
dimensions to deal with this use case.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.410
Just like the Android
plug-in will create tasks for

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.780
each combination of build type and
product flavor.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.310
You will now be able to build every
possible permutation build type,

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.349
product flavor, and flavor dimension.
