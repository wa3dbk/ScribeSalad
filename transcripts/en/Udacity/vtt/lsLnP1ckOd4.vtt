00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.900
Okay, continuing our ROB Timing Quiz,

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.510
we have seen that the multiplication now is going to execute write, commit,

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.360
exec cycles, three, five, eight. Now let's see what happens with the add and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.040
multiplication here. So the question for you is, when does the add and

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.370
multiply issue? Note that they don't need to issue in the same cycle. In fact,

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.610
they won't because we can only issue one instruction per cycle. So the question

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.260
is when does the add issue and when does the multiply issue? Write your answers

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.690
here for the issue. And also when do they commit? Write your answer here for

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.100
commit for the add, and write your answer here for the commit for the multiply.
