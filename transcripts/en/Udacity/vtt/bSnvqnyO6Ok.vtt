00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.295
The term that belongs in this slot is b over 2 a. We get that by dividing this

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:08.858
middle coefficient by 2. Since we know that this plus itself has to equal b over

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:13.209
a. Now what term belongs here? Well, this needs to compensate for the amount

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.676
that we're adding to the entire expression on the left-hand side. When we

00:00:17.676 --> 00:00:22.653
inserted b over 2a right here, this is just adding a constant that is b over 2a

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:28.072
squared times that coefficient of a that's outside. This simplifies to b squared

00:00:28.072 --> 00:00:30.919
over 4a. So that's what belongs right here.
