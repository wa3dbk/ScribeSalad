00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.578
&gt;&gt; Genomics is the study of all the hereditary material,

00:00:03.578 --> 00:00:06.455
or DNA, that makes up who you are. Now, until about

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:08.915
a decade ago, it wasn't even possible to look at

00:00:08.915 --> 00:00:11.833
your whole genome at one time. We were only looking at

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.263
bits and pieces of your genome, regions we called genes,

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:19.406
individually, in a field called genetics. And eventually over time the

00:00:19.406 --> 00:00:22.517
field of genetics, looking at these individual genes one at

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:25.708
a time blossomed into this field of genomics. Now the global

00:00:25.708 --> 00:00:28.268
picture of genomics is to get a global picture of

00:00:28.268 --> 00:00:30.914
you. Looking at many genes at one time to see

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:33.970
how they shape who you are. Obviously, this is a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.840
pretty big task and we could use a little bit

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.110
of help. We've teamed up with 23andMe, a personal genetics

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.970
company based in California that aims to connect people with

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.460
their own genomes. I'd like to introduce to all of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.316
you the Senior Director of Research at 23andMe, Joanna Mountain.

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:51.351
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Matt. I'm really excited to be part of Tales from the Genome.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:54.191
&gt;&gt; Well, we're pretty excited to have you here. I'm curious, is there any

00:00:54.191 --> 00:00:56.470
trait about yourself that you've always wondered

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.257
more about what the genetic cause is?

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.316
&gt;&gt; I have to say, I was always curious

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.801
about why I had red hair and freckles and no

00:01:02.801 --> 00:01:05.036
one else in my family did. And where did

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:07.774
that come from? Yeah, how did I get so lucky?

00:01:07.774 --> 00:01:08.139
[LAUGH]

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:12.227
And so that's something that I was curious about for much of my

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:14.790
life. And when I was able to look into my DNA, I could

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.273
start to learn more about who I might have inherited that from, and,

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:22.690
and what the genetic basis was for, for that red hair and freckling.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.950
&gt;&gt; Now I'm sure some of you out there

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.270
have wondered about your own traits, so tell us.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.250
What's one trait about yourself that you've always wanted

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.390
to know a bit more about the genetic basis for?
