00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.800
Cryptography is
the foundation of security.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.530
In this lesson, we will first
introduce the basics of encryption

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.210
as well as attacks on
encryption schemes.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.110
We will highlight several historical and
simple encryption schemes.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.870
We will then introduce three types
of modern-day cryptography and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.270
how they are used in security.
