00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.883
For this question you're asked to record the number of clicks for a URL for a given keyword.

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:14.992
So when the URL is chosen for that keyword and the user clicks on it.

00:00:14.992 --> 00:00:18.525
Now this is so that we have a measure of the popularity for the URL,

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:22.252
and so the search results can be ordered on that.

00:00:22.252 --> 00:00:27.367
In order to do this we're going to have to change the stucture of our index

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:30.983
so that we have the count associated with each URL

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:38.993
and in order to do that we're going to replace the URL with a list which is url, count.

00:00:38.993 --> 00:00:45.623
That means that everytime we have the url we have to replace it with a list [url,0]

00:00:45.623 --> 00:00:49.487
because the count initally will be 0.

00:00:49.487 --> 00:00:51.506
That changes the structure.

00:00:51.506 --> 00:00:58.275
What we haven't yet done is taken into consideration the duplicate elements.

00:00:58.275 --> 00:01:04.687
We're going to do something similar to the previous question where you were asked to remove duplicates.

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:11.829
from the index but this time it's going to be slightly different because of this structure of url, count.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.665
We're going to check we have the keyword as before

00:01:16.665 --> 00:01:18.094
then when we have the keyword,

00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:21.081
we're going to loop through this list here

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:27.433
and we're going to check whether each element in the list here,

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:31.119
whether the first position in that is our URL.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.972
If it is, then we're done - we don't want to add it again to the index.

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:39.120
If it isn't there, after we've looped through all of the URLs

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.319
then we'll add it to the index as before.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.795
That takes care of duplicates

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:48.896
and the change in the structure of the index

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.752
what we now need to do is to sort out the clicks.

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:57.868
To do this, we're going to look up in the index to find our keyword

00:01:57.868 --> 00:02:01.309
and that's going to give us all the associated urls.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:03.150
If we've got some urls

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.259
- well if we haven't got any urls, then there is nothing to do

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.138
we're not going to be able to click on anything.

00:02:07.138 --> 00:02:14.942
If we have got some urls if the first position is our url that we're looking for -

00:02:14.942 --> 00:02:21.618
remember than lookup now return this whole list of url, count pairs

00:02:21.618 --> 00:02:26.694
so we're just going to have to look at the url, the first entry to see if it matches to see if it matches

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:29.025
rather than the whole list

00:02:29.025 --> 00:02:30.687
and so if it does match

00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:35.981
then we're going to increment the count, which is the second position by one

00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:39.000
and that's it.
