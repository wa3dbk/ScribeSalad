00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.370
Let's look at the same example, starting off with this one.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.680
But this one I'll actually be doing comparisons on ISO versus

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.570
aperture and shutters.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.070
Filled out the same thing as before.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.757
We're basically now going from increasing the speed from one-tenth to 2500.

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:19.683
So we basically increase the shutter speed.

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:23.040
Now, let's actually look at different ISO values.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.078
One one hundred, 200 is the ISO.

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:32.707
This was 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400.

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:37.525
Now again you notice that as I got to 6400, it got much more brighter.

00:00:37.525 --> 00:00:42.947
And this one is underexposed at 100.

00:00:42.947 --> 00:00:47.547
So here somewhere in this range would have been a good choice of a ISO value,

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.383
with respect to what we want.

00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.120
Of course, we could fill this out also.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.644
So this is, ISO is increasing and this is shutter speed.

00:00:55.644 --> 00:00:59.491
So you see the effect, and again, photographers do the best they can to

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:02.950
figure out what first scene that they want a different effect.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.210
That's why they also carry a light meter sometimes, to kind of get a sense what

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.950
would be the best combination of the shutter speed, the aperture value and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.280
ISO they could use for the for the purpose of the pictures they are taking.
