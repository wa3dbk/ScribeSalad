00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.150
So, to summarize this, we brought together concepts of convolution and

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.100
correlation, specifically cross-correlation, to compute image gradience,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.550
use that to compute image edges, we talked about how smoothing, is important

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.460
in computing gradience, and I showed four different ways of actually using,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.850
a specific type of kernel and a pipeline to compute edges from images.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.840
Next, we're going to take a little bit of a different turn in our work, so

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.800
far, we've been talking a lot about images, we're going to go back and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.240
now talk about cameras, optics, and lenses, this will allow us to

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.931
start thinking about the computation photography pipeline, and

00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:41.411
a little bit more carefully, and then we'll actually return back to edges and

00:00:41.411 --> 00:00:45.250
its detection, as we get into whole concept of feature matching.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.490
We'll also be looking at very ideal ways we can actually look at an image not

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.230
just at its own scale of resolution but also multiple resolutions of the image.

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.457
More exciting stuff is on the way.
