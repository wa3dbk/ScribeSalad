00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.140
So for me, the reason why I even come into

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.980
this field of data science is my passion for something specific,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.630
which is natural language. Right, so I, and it, I

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.110
observe the people who work around me who knows about data

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.379
science. I think one thing that's very important is they

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.430
either have, like, a passion for the particular data they're looking

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.240
at. Like, you know, natural language, or like speech recognition kind

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.290
of data. Or some people are just very interested in patterns

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.270
in data. Like when they see some kind of some, data they

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.870
would just like, try to calculate you know, like the mean of

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.360
the data, the variance of data. They, they, it comes natural to

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.810
them because they want to find patterns to the data. So I think

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.520
for anyone who wants to become a data scientist, it's good to

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.370
think about, what kind of data you are interested in doing, and

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.100
start with that. And then later on when you have this skill

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.500
of analyzing data, you can apply it to any other kind of thing.
