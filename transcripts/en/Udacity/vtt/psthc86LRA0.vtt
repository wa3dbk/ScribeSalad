00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.174
Have you ever played tic-tac-toe?

00:00:02.174 --> 00:00:05.660
The board looks like this,
and you take turns with

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.828
another player trying to make
a row of three Xs or Os in a row.

00:00:09.828 --> 00:00:12.690
I would play this all the time
with my cousins, because it's so

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.311
easy to draw out on a piece of paper.

00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.697
But it didn't hold our attention for
long.

00:00:16.697 --> 00:00:20.942
Most of the time we would tie, and
it would get boring really quickly.

00:00:20.942 --> 00:00:24.450
You can imagine if this were a game app,
I wouldn't play it for

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.179
long because the pace is too slow and
the game is too predictable.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.557
To really attract and
keep players interested,

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:32.950
you want to make a challenging game.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.225
When I think of a challenging game,
they all have a few things in common.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:41.590
First, the game starts off slowly so
that it's easy to play and understand.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.982
Second, the game complexity
grows over time.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:47.767
This is especially important for
monetization,

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.611
because complex difficult portions
of your game can be good places to

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:56.270
introduce in-app purchases that can help
players overcome certain challenges.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.138
If you decide to include in-app
purchases like this, keep in mind that

00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:04.197
if a game is too challenging without
them, it will detract from the quality

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:08.194
of the game, and it can drive players
away if they feel like they're being

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.431
forced to buy helpful items in
order to advance in the game.

00:01:11.431 --> 00:01:16.068
So, always keep in mind your players and
their game experience, because a quality

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:20.110
game experience Is the most important
aspect of a challenging game, and

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.769
design your in-app purchases to
be helpful, but not required.

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:27.672
A good example of a game that
bounces being challenging, but

00:01:27.672 --> 00:01:30.208
not too challenging, is Candy Crush.

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:33.450
Candy Crush has a lot of
levels to progress through.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.378
They start off relatively easy and
introduce you to the rules of the game.

00:01:37.378 --> 00:01:40.162
And as you breeze through
the first couple levels,

00:01:40.162 --> 00:01:42.177
it gives you some winning momentum.

00:01:42.177 --> 00:01:44.928
The levels get more
challenging over time.

00:01:44.928 --> 00:01:48.896
Here you can see the difference
between early level of Candy Crush and

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:52.659
a later one that's a special level,
which includes licorice and

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.385
bubbles as extra obstacles.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:58.965
And when you don't quite pass a level
it feels like you were so, so close.

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:02.870
And if you just need a little extra
push, the game will offer you items and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.833
power-ups for
purchase that will give you that push.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:09.318
And this is a great example of
why it's so important to plan for

00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:12.672
monetization early on, so
that you can have good timing and

00:02:12.672 --> 00:02:16.988
introduce in-app purchases right when
players might need an extra boost.

00:02:16.988 --> 00:02:19.163
But it's hard to know
exactly what challenges or

00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:21.506
items your game players
will like the best.

00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:24.606
So later in the course, we'll talk about
how to test out different versions of

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:28.256
your game, like different challenges or
levels, to see what works best.
