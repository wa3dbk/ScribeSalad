00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.250
In this session we're going to talk
about another collection type called

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.500
dictionaries.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.344
And like arrays,

00:00:05.344 --> 00:00:09.140
dictionaries access their values
using unique keys instead of indexes.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.760
And that's why called them dictionaries,
because it's like looking up

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.070
a definition for
a keyword in the dictionary.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.720
Let's get started.
