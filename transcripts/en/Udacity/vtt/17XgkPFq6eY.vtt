00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.540
I'm going to walk you through
my thought process on how I

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.950
built this responsive
weather forecast page.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.650
Typically, when I'm trying to pick
my breakpoints, I'll start in

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.379
my desktop browser with my viewport
set as small as I can get it.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.060
I also like to have the Chrome DevTools
open because it shows me

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.290
the screen width in the upper right-hand
corner as I resize the window.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.880
Next, I'll slowly start
resizing the window,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.570
looking to see when the content
tells me that it wants a breakpoint.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.850
And probably somewhere here,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.280
at about the 550 pixel mark,
looks like a good place.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.510
Anything wider and

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.730
the spaces between these columns
are going to become too big.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.389
In my code,
I've already got my viewport set and

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:54.221
a default set of styles that
are applied for any viewport width.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:01:01.410
I'll add weather-medium.css to the head
with a media query that checks for

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.501
a screen and if the viewport
width is greater than 550 pixels.

00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.169
Great.

00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:14.341
I'll switch back to the browser,
hit Refresh, and start to resize.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.176
Perfect.

00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:19.380
At 550 pixels,
things look exactly like I expect.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.250
Because that breakpoint
was only at 550 pixels,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.920
I think I probably
want to add another one.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.930
Otherwise, we'll run into
the same problem with too much

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.850
space between columns.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.590
I easily have a room for
another one since most desktops and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.390
laptops are significantly
wider than 550 pixels.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.720
I'll go through the same process, and
I'll continue to expand the viewport

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.480
until it looks like I
need another breakpoint.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.200
Again, I'm looking for

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.450
a place where the content tells
me that it wants a breakpoint.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.880
700 pixels looks to be right
about the right place.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.360
So, I'm going to go ahead and
add one here.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.760
Again, I'll add a new style sheet,
but this time,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.590
point it at weather-large.css.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.120
It'll check for screen and

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.525
check to see if the viewport
width is at least 700 pixels.

00:02:12.525 --> 00:02:17.540
A quick refresh in the browser and
resize.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.260
And we've got it.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.080
Things are looking good.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.783
I could keep adding breakpoints, but

00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:29.021
in this case, I think having two
breakpoints is enough, essentially one

00:02:29.021 --> 00:02:35.360
at a small viewport, one at a medium
viewport, and one at a large viewport.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.730
Okay, that's enough of me talking.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.520
Now it's your turn to give it a try.
