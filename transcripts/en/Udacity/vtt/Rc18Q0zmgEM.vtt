00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.640
Here are the three properties again that we've been discussing, the Product

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.380
Property, the Quotient Property, and the Power Property. Many logarithmic

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.140
expressions can be rewritten or expanded or condensed using these properties.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.314
First, let's think about what it means to expand a logarithmic expression. That

00:00:17.314 --> 00:00:20.442
basically means that we're going to break down something that looks complicated

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:25.172
into smaller pieces. This logarithmic equation is a great one to work with for

00:00:25.172 --> 00:00:31.644
doing this. We have log base 3 of 6x squared y cubed. Let's break it down, we

00:00:31.644 --> 00:00:36.204
can expand this to log base 3 of 6 plus log base 3 of x squared plus log base 3

00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:41.956
of y cubed. Which property that you've learned about allowed us to do this

00:00:41.956 --> 00:00:45.994
expansion? Was it the product property, the log of the product is equal to the

00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:51.522
sum of the logs? Was it the quotient property, the log of the quotient is equal

00:00:51.522 --> 00:00:56.832
to the difference of logs? Or was it the power property, the log of something

00:00:56.832 --> 00:01:01.880
raised to a power is equal to the power times just the log?
