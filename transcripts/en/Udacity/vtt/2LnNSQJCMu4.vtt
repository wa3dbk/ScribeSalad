00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.696
So our second combined therapy, are the integrative therapies. And these are

00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:08.440
eclectic. And by eclectic what we mean is that the therapist can use any

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.490
technique he or she feels is best for the situation. So for example, in

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.448
treating post traumatic stress disorder, sometimes we use prolonged exposure

00:00:18.448 --> 00:00:23.762
therapy. And prolonged exposure therapy is a combination of cognitive

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:29.008
behavioral therapy and systematic desensitization and relaxation therapy. So

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:32.848
the idea here is that the person thinks about, is exposed to the trauma in

00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:36.752
their, in their minds, they imagine it, but at the same time, they also are

00:00:36.752 --> 00:00:44.157
relaxed and have to stay relaxed. So, if that happens, they become desensitized

00:00:44.157 --> 00:00:49.730
to the trauma and it no longer bothers them. Now sometimes, in fact, drugs

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.630
might also be added to this combination to help treat the anxiety and help with

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.770
the relaxation.
