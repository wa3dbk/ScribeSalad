I'm going to give you just a tiny glimpse of this great terrain demo by Stavros

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:08.520
Papadopoulos and you should definitely go check it out yourself. It shows a

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.852
wonderful terrain rendering system with a level of detail. I'm going to turn on

00:00:11.852 --> 00:00:15.062
the wire frame just to show you what I mean. As we get closer to various pieces

00:00:15.062 --> 00:00:19.458
of terrain, a more detailed version is popped in. Notice that flat areas don't

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:23.740
need much detail but hilly areas do. Anyway, this is just a taste. You should

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.860
definitely go check out this website and read it over and try out the demo.
