00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.830
We haven't stated these explicitly, but

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.330
we've been operating
under some assumptions.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.060
For technical analysis we assume that
there is information in historical price

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.885
and volume data that we can discover and
exploit in advance of the market.

00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:17.395
For fundamental analysis we assume there
is information in fundamental data,

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:22.325
like earnings, that can be exploited and
traded upon in advance of the market.

00:00:22.325 --> 00:00:25.275
The efficient markets hypothesis
says we're wrong about both.
