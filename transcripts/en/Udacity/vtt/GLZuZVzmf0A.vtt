00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.435
Now that we identify the classes in my system,

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:04.930
let's see how we can identify the attributes for

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.680
these classes. First of all let's recall what attributes

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.355
are. Attributes represent the structure of a class the individual

00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:15.530
data items that compose the state of the class.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.530
So how do we identify these attributes? Attributes may be

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.070
found in one of three ways. By examining class

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.330
definitions, by studying the requirements, and by applying domain knowledge.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.400
And notice that I want to stress, that this is always

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.800
a very important aspect. No matter what kind of system you're

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.670
developing. Domain knowledge tends to be fairly important to identify things

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.200
Which might not be provided in the descriptions of the system

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.070
that tend to be incomplete. And that you can derive by

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.390
the fact that you are familiar with the domain. So always

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.340
keep in mind the domain knowledge is important for analysis, for

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.430
design, for requirements gathering and so on. So now let's go

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.530
back to our description of the system. As I said,

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.450
I will bring you back for each step of our

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.200
analysis. And in this case, we're going to focus on

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.550
course offering. And we can say that the course offering, according

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.610
to the description, has a number, a location, and a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.140
time. So this is a pretty clear indication that these are

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.650
important aspects of the course offering. So they probably should

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.600
become attributes of the course offering class. So now if we

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.400
report here that sentence, and once more, we underline

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.330
the information that we underlined in the description. We can

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.540
clearly see how this can be mapped into the definition

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.730
of the class. So our class course offering after this

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.900
step the analysis will have 3 attributes: number, location, and

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.270
time. And as you can see here, I'm not specifying

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.540
the type or any other additional information. So in this

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.640
first step I'm just interested in having a first draft.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.170
of the class diagram, that I can then

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.440
refine in the next iterations of my analysis.
