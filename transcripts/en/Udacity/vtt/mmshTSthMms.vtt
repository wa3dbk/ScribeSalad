00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.920
I'd like to show you now how we use
this process to build a machine-learning

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.950
based forecaster at a FinTech company,
at my company, Lucena Research.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.610
The first step is to select which
factors do you want to use?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.530
So those are our Xs.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.510
Remember, it can be multi-dimensional.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.870
So these are things like
Bollinger Bands, PE ratio and so on.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.530
Measurable quantities about a company

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.780
that can be predictive
of its stock price.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.160
The next step is to select what
is it you want to predict?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.560
Usually we want to predict change in
price, market relative change in price,

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.960
or for now we could just think
about that as future price.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.000
These both become our data, our Xs and
our Ys that we used to train the model.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.050
Now that we know what our
predictive factors are and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.890
what Y is going to be,
we need to consider the breadth and

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.965
depth of the data that we're going to
use to train the system with.

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:01.300
So that includes, for
instance, time period.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.000
How far back in time do you
want to go to train the system?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.130
And what's your stock universe?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.440
What universe of data,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.050
which symbols are you going to
use to train the system as well?

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.350
Now we can train our model.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.590
We can take this data
to produce that model.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.370
We unleash our machine
learning algorithm.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.410
This might be kNN.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.885
It might be a linear regression.

00:01:23.885 --> 00:01:25.510
It could be decision tree.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.810
Whatever.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.950
That algorithm takes this data and
converts it into a model.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.910
We're ready now to use that
model to do some prediction.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.220
The way we do that is we measure
the quantities about the stocks that we

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.480
want to make a prediction for now.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.610
We measure what those Xs are today,
plug those into the model and

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.920
the model should provide us our Y,
or our prediction.
