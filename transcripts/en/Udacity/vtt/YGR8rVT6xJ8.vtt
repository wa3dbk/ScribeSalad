00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.200
The fact that request animation frame, runs once

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.135
and only once during a redraw cycle also

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:10.530
let's the browser optimize concurrent animations. SVG, CSS

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.250
transitions, scrolling, your own dom-based manipulation together, into

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.070
a single reflow and repaint cycle. Rather than,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.140
each of these poking in in it's own

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.510
timer and updating the screen whenever it feels

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.850
like. This leads to much higher fidelity visual refreshes.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.010
But, in addition to causing all these refreshes together,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.280
this has the effect of locking the updates, to the

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.090
visual refresh rate as a maximum. You won't accidentally

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.325
call your drawing routine more than once during that magic

00:00:39.325 --> 00:00:43.920
16.7 millisecond long refresh cycle, which would waste work.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.180
Request animation frame won't be called again, until the current

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.180
frame is pushed out to the screen and it's

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.980
ready for another frame. And then finally, there's one more

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.620
key feature to request animation frame. Their callback won't

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.050
be called, if the browser tab isn't visible. That's,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.600
if you're running the animation loop in a tab

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.360
and the user switiches away, the browser won't keep

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.440
calling the visual refresh callback, it will once it's

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.618
visible again. But, this means you won't be using

00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:13.988
the CPU, the GPU or extra memory potentially. Which

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:17.390
will lead to longer battery life on a mobile device.
