00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.687
Now that we have an equation to solve, I want you to figure out the time it

00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:06.832
takes for the slower person, and the time it takes for the faster person. Keep

00:00:06.832 --> 00:00:10.549
in mind that the slower person would be x and the faster person would be x

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.824
minus 6. Good luck.
