00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.510
So for my high five example, I had to come up with a hypothesis, which is like

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.180
an if-then statement. It's a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. So I think

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.230
that if I give my co-workers high fives then they will be happier. So I gave

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.640
one group high fives. That was my experimental group and then I gave the other

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.080
group no high fives, that was my control group. Then I counted the number of

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.110
smiles front he people one act group. So what is the independent variable in

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.840
this study? Is it high fives, is it happiness, or is it my co workers? Select

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.833
which one you think is the independent variable...
