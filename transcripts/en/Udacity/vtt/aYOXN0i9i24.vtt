00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.870
You know, modern cars may still have a keyhole. But you don't have to use

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.190
it. As long as the key is nearby, it senses that you're an authorized driver.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.500
So, how do I unlock this car? I just put my hand inside and

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.230
watch, it unlocks. Nice. Really, simple.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.730
Easy. Turns on the interior lights too, so I can see. I can see

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.420
inside when it's dark. [NOISE]. Now suppose I leave,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.870
and I want to lock the car. How do I

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.420
do it? Well you can't see, but there's a

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.558
little ridged area here. And if I touch it, watch.

00:00:36.558 --> 00:00:42.960
It locks. Oh. But I left all the windows

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.950
open. And the sunroof open. Do I have to

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.050
open the car, and go in and manually shut

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.990
them? No, there's a secret way of shutting it. Secret,

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.578
hm. See, if I hold my finger here for a little while. The

00:00:58.578 --> 00:01:04.640
windows shut. And the sunroof shuts. But

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.810
it is a secret. How do you ever learn it? Well, it's in the

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.970
manual. But who reads the manual? It's a big thick manual. People don't read

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.290
the manual. I know lots of people who own this car. Who are not

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.370
aware that they can shut all the windows and sunroof, without going back inside.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.180
Nice feature. Hard to know about it.
