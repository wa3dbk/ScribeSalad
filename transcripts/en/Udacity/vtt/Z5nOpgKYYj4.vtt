00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.150
As you can see here, after I've created or appended this div element to contain

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.640
all my buttons, I'm simply selecting all the divs in that parent div,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.750
binding data corresponding to all the years, making an enter selection which

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.570
will grab me all the elements that are currently not yet on the page.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.600
Which in this case is going to be all of them since we are near the top of our

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.960
file, and append div that has text equal to the data itself.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.950
And as you can see here, I've moved the code that we wrote earlier up to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.230
the top of the file to find all the years in which there was a World Cup.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.920
So that for the buttons I don't have to hand code every year one at a time.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.480
I can simply bind the years array to my div elements.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.850
I've also added some CSS styling above to make the buttons somewhat pleasing.
