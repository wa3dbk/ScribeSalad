00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.184
To factor this expression, we first want to find the greatest common factor. We

00:00:04.184 --> 00:00:08.180
can find the prime factorization of each of our terms. Now we want to look for

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.067
the lowest power of each factor that appears in each term. We can see that a

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:16.008
factor of 2 appears in each term and in fact there's two of them. So 2 squared

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.384
is a part of our greatest common factor. The next factor that we multiply into

00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:24.863
our greatest common factor is 3. There's a power of 3 to the 1 for all of our

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:29.643
terms. We can not include x as a factor since it doesn't appear here, but we can

00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:34.070
include a y. Y to the 1 would be part of our greatest common factor. When I

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.920
multiply all these factors together I get 12 y. That goes on the outside. When

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.333
we divide this first term by 12y, we're left with 2x. We can also see that in

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:47.858
our factors. If we take out 12y, then we're left with 2x. The second term is a

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:52.378
little bit more simple. We will just be left with x times y, and again, we see

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:57.044
that in our factors. The last term will be negative 3y squared. It's what we'll

00:00:57.044 --> 00:01:02.456
get when we multiply the remaining factors together. So this expression has been

00:01:02.456 --> 00:01:07.204
completely factored. We have one number times another number.
