00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.360
The answer is Error: incompatible types. A Dog is not a kind of House. If you

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.956
try to store a Dog in a variable that's made to hold a House, you'll get a

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:14.842
compile time error, which is good. If Java let you store a Dog in a House

00:00:14.842 --> 00:00:20.780
variable, you might then try to call House methods on the Dog. And the Dog

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.792
wouldn't know how to do them. Getting this error is actually a good thing. It

00:00:24.792 --> 00:00:28.067
means that java is helping us. This is one of the things that we were talking

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:32.476
about when we mentioned really early on that java is a safe language. If java

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:35.836
let you create a Dog and then store it as a House, you might try to live in it

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:40.530
later and fail. But instead of doing that, the compiler will immediately tell

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.422
you that there's something wrong with your code. Other languages might allow

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:46.816
you to keep running the code, and then mysteriously fail or return the wrong

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:51.952
results. This third option isn't quite what we want. This the area that you

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:56.692
would get if Dog were an interface. If you tried to make a new Drawable, then

00:00:56.692 --> 00:01:01.192
you would get an error like this. Error Drawable is abstract cannot be

00:01:01.192 --> 00:01:06.336
instantiated. The Drawable interface has methods sort of, but it doesn't have

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:11.890
enough detail about them for Java to actually make an object Drawable for you.
