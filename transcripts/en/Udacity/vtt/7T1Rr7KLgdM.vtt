00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer as it turns out will be just 0.2 everywhere,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the reason is with every grid cell being equally likely,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
applying this motion model will still make each grid cell equally likely.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's pick one of them--say this one over here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We could have arrived here in 3 different ways.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Perhaps we started in x2 and our motion went well.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This gives us a 0.2 x 0.8.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Perhaps we started in x1 and we overshot,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which gives us a 0.2, for the cell x1, times a 0.1 for overshooting.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Or perhaps we started in x3 and we undershot, which gives us 0.2 x 0.1.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If we add those up, then we find it is the same as 0.2 x 1,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because the factors over here add up exactly to 1, which makes 0.2.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The result is 0.2.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
You can apply this same logic to all the other cells.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This guy over here could have come from this guy, this guy, this guy,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
where this one is weighted with 0.8 and the other two with 0.1.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
That's called a convolution,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and as well see later, there's a very nice way to write this mathematically

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
as something called Theorem of Total Probability.

00:01:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
But for the time being, I'd like to program this in.
