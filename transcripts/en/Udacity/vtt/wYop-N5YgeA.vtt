00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.770
Hello, I'm Seerajperhead.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.870
I'm a program manager at Udacity, and
this is my bad interview experience.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.640
So, after three years
of engineering college,

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.190
I really wanted to intern at this
one tech company in Cupertino.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.040
I spent all year preparing for this and

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.890
I knew that this was the company
I wanted to work for.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.790
I nailed my first interview and
then got into the second interview

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.410
which was a tech screen
with one of their teams.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.290
And I completely failed it.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.740
I don't even remember the questions.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.690
I don't remember if I was dizzy or
tired or

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.120
sleepy or what, or
just unqualified I guess.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.500
But that interview was terrible.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.440
I spent about two weeks
like depressed about it,

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.028
thinking about like that it's time for
me to move on.

00:00:43.028 --> 00:00:45.710
And find like a different
company I'd be interested in.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.900
Surprisingly the recruiter
called me back.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.240
And that while I didn't make their
one position, they wanted me for

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.310
a different one.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.510
So I agreed, and happily took another
interview which I also failed.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.650
At that point I realized that maybe
I wasn't cut out to be an engineer

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.990
at their company.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.220
And I decided that I would
look at other companies and

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.700
finally move on from these dreams.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.035
But then the recruiter
messaged me again and said,

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:14.250
Sia, while you're not cut out for one of
our engineering positions the summer,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.270
would you like to have
a product interview?

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.780
And I didn't know much about products,
but I was like, sure.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.860
This is the company.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.840
This must be it.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.600
Whatever.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300
Let's do this.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.030
And that interview went amazing.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.110
Looking back at that summer, I realize
that the product role was a much better

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360
fit for me than any engineering role
could have been at that company.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.330
So my takeaway from this is that
sometimes interviews don't go the way

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.000
you want them to,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.640
and sometimes job positions don't enough
the way that you think they will.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.010
Don't stress too much about a bad
interview, because in the end,

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.960
it just becomes a funny
story to tell your friends.
