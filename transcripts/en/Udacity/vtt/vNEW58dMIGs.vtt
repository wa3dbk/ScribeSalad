00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.430
So go ahead and fix a problem that calls the

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.400
error. So here's my query to get the conferences right, order

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.790
by name, so let's just take that off. We don't want

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.260
to order by name right there, instead, we want to order

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.740
by max attendees, we put that right after we add

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.100
the filter for it. But we still want to order by name,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.280
so let's just add that second sort order in here. Then

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.580
you can go ahead and test the function. Just make sure

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.050
that you actually have some conferences that satisfy

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.180
all these criteria, otherwise you won't get any results.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.820
So let's say you've got this query, to

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.360
get all the conferences. How would you update it

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.550
to filter for conferences in Tokyo, where there's

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.370
at least one but less than ten seats available?

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.090
And the results are sorted by the number seats

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.220
available, the name of the conference, and the month.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.880
So when you figured it out, go ahead and enter the code here.
