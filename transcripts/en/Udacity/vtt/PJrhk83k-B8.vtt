00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.235
This problem we're going to start of with a template

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.080
for a recursively generated graph. If the template says if I

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.440
want one node, it'll just return a single node. For

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.560
other values, make a G1 and a G2 that are half

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.160
the size. And then we make log n connections between

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.940
G1 and G2 by picking a random point and connecting with

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.990
a random node, another random node. And connecting with a random

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.520
node etc. And then return. So this has the recurrence relationship

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.265
that only have one node with zero edges. And if

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:32.706
we have n nodes, we get 2 times the number of

00:00:32.706 --> 00:00:35.775
nodes we have for a graph of half the size

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:38.590
plus big theta of log n. And so what we want

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.730
you to do is to solve this recurrence. But we

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.440
are going to do this one little differently, than some of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.930
our previous homework assignments. Instead of a multiple choice question, we

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.760
want you to explain how to actually solve this. So below

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.730
there's a form link, and at that link you'll see

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.780
this question restated. We want you to do is wirte up

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.680
your answer, post your response to the form, get the link

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.640
for your answer. And then insert it here. I'll give an

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.129
example to make this more clear. So here's the question on

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.110
the forum. And you should write up your answer. Some possible

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.510
answers might be that T of n is theta log n,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.800
theta n log n, theta n, theta n squared. There's any

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.390
other function. And then you should explain why you've

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.730
answered like this. Or just submit your answer. Hit

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.540
the link button. Copy out the link. Now, if

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.830
you've copied the link, paste it into the box here.
