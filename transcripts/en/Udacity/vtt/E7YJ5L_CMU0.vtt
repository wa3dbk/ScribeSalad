00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.490
Before we go on,
let me introduce myself.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.600
My name's Andy, and three years ago,
I couldn't code at all.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.450
Now I can, and
I want to tell you how that happened.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.040
I graduated from college in
2009 with a degree in physics.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.790
And I had no coding skill at all.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.300
And at the time, I was actually
pretty intimidated by programming.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.290
Even though I didn't start
learning to code until 2012,

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.560
these three years from 2009 to 2012,
are relevant to how I learned to code.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.300
Because it was during this time that
I was doing a lot of teaching and

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.380
a lot of learning about
how people learn.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.110
And I learned something that would wind
up being incredibly important to me.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380
When I would eventually learn to code.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.120
I learned that anyone
can learn anything.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.460
Well, just about anyone can
learn just about anything.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.160
But for the most part, this is true,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.780
because even though everyone has
different backgrounds and experiences

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.120
when you get down to the level of
brains they're all very similar.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680
And our brain is also this
incredibly flexible thing.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.519
By giving it the right input you
can actually change your brain and

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.510
make it do whatever you want.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.996
But, that's enough about the brain.

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:12.620
After three years of teaching and
learning, sometime in early February of

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.050
2012, I heard about this new
education company called Udacity.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.640
That was actually what the logo
looked like at the time.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.700
I didn't know much about it, but online
education sounded really interesting, so

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.420
I emailed someone who worked there.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.860
Three days later,
I was on a plane to San Francisco.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.570
It was very exciting.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.490
But things at Udacity were
pretty chaotic back then, and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.890
nobody had even told me
what my job would be,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.460
though I assumed it had something to
do with education and maybe technology.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.800
Either way,
February 15th was my first day of work,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.510
and I would figure it out then.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.000
That morning, I got dropped off at
our office, which, at the time,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.388
was just Sebastian, who's our CEO.

00:01:48.388 --> 00:01:50.050
It was his house.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.920
So, I walk to the door, I still didn't
know what my role would be, but

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.430
that was going to change
in about 30 seconds.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.690
I rang the bell and Sebastian answered.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.870
Our conversation went
something like this.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.740
He told me that I would be the assistant
instructor for the course he was making.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.580
This was news to me, but
I was trying to play it cool.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.330
So I asked him to remind me of
the title and then he told me.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.400
The course was called CS373 How
to Program a Robotic Car.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.800
And I was terrified.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.080
I didn't know anything about
programming or robotics.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.850
And I might have quit right then,
if I hadn't remembered that lesson.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.830
And because I really believe
that anyone can learn anything,

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.400
I started learning and
I haven't stopped.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.410
And now, here I am today.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
Very, very excited to be assembling
the resource I wish I had had

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.940
three years ago.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.250
Now, you may be thinking, why should
I entrust my programming education

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.730
to someone who only has
three years of experience?

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.020
And the answer is,
you shouldn't and you aren't.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.730
Let me explain how this
non-degree is going to work.
