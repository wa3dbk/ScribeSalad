00:00:00.076 --> 00:00:03.318
Atomic memory operation have a number of limitations that you need to know about.

00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:06.891
First of all, only certain operations and data types are supported.

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:11.979
So there's things like add and subtract, and min and x or, and so forth.

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:18.795
But you can't do every operation. There's no mod, for example. There's no exponentiate.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:24.039
You can't do every operation. And only certain data types are supported,

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.245
in particular, mostly integer types.

00:00:27.245 --> 00:00:34.352
So, atomic ad and atomic exchange are the only types that actually support floating point operations.

00:00:34.352 --> 00:00:36.175
There's a workaround for this.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:38.606
It turns out that you can implement any atomic operation

00:00:38.606 --> 00:00:41.488
by using the atomic compare and swap operation.

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:47.149
And I'm not going to go into the details. This gets into mutexes and critical sections.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.390
There's a short example in the programming guide that gives you an example

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.056
of how to implement, for example, 64 bit operations using atomic CAS.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.090
You need to be aware that there's still is no ordering constraints, right?

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.873
So the different threads in a thread block and the different thread blocks themselves

00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:05.039
will be running in some unspecified order.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.847
It will be different every time.

00:01:06.847 --> 00:01:13.525
So the operations that you're performing on memory using a atomics are

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:16.387
still going to happen in an unspecified order.

00:01:16.387 --> 00:01:20.116
This is important, because floating-point arithmetic is actually non-associative.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:27.828
In other words, the quantity of "a plus b plus c" is not the same as "a plus the quantity of b plus c."

00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:32.253
It's real easy to convince yourself if you look at numbers like say, a equals 1,

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:36.218
b equals 10 to the 99th, and c equals 10 to the 99th.

00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:40.788
You can just plug this into your c decompiler or your calculator, for that matter,

00:01:40.788 --> 00:01:44.934
and you'll discover that you don't get the same number, depending on what order you do these operations in.

00:01:44.934 --> 00:01:50.131
And the final thing to be really aware of with atomics is that there's no magic happening under the hood.

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:55.118
The GPU is still forcing each thread to take turns giving access to that memory.

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:58.455
It's serializing the access to memory among the different threads.

00:01:58.455 --> 00:02:01.855
And this can make atomic operations very slow, if you're not careful.

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:03.980
Let's look into that.
