00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answers are for this anchor the prefix has got to be one character--the A.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This anchor--we can't cover another anchor, so it's got to be zero.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This anchor--we conclude this if we want, but we can't go on to the other anchor, so it's zero to one.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here we've got to include the D but nothing else, so it's 1.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now, there's one more thing about anchors I want to cover,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is how we deal with the words in the other direction.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For these five anchors there are no letters in the other direction.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So these are completely unconstrained.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We say that any letter can go into those spots.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But in these two anchors, there's adjacent letters,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and it would be okay. We could form a word going in this direction.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But we can do that only if we can also form a word going in this direction.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Let's say there are no more. This is either the edge of the board or the next row is all blanks.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Then we can say, well, what letters can go here?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Only the letters that form a word when the first letter is that word and the second letter is U.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In our dictionary, it turns out that that possibility is the set of letters M, N, and X.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
MU, NU, and XU are all words in our dictionary, believe it or not.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The Scrabble dictionaries are notorious for having two- and three-letter words

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that you've never heard of.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Similarly here--what are two-letter words that end in Y?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It' the set M, O, A, B. You've probably heard of most of those.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
When we go to place words on a particular row,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we can pre-compute the crosswords and make that be part of the anchor.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What we're going to do is have a process that goes through, finds all the anchor points,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and finds all the sets of letters--whether it's any letter for these five anchors,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
or whether it's a constrained set of anchor letters for these two anchors.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Sounds complicated, but we can make it all work.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Let me say that once you've got this concept, the concept of the anchor sets

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and the cross words, then basically we're done. We've done it all.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We can handle a complete board no matter how complicated, and we can get all the plays.

00:02:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It's just a matter of implementing this idea and then just fleshing it out.
