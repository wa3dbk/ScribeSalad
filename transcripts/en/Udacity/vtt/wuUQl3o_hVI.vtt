00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.840
Okay. Do I have tips or advice for data scientists?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; To become a data scientist.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.220
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for aspiring data scientists. That's a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.040
great question and I think going back to the

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.380
issue of what is data science. Like I said,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.830
I think there's really I would, I would divide

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.080
it into 3 somewhat different parts. And, and so

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.040
one of the first pieces of advice that I

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.320
would give to people looking to get in the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.380
field is to think about what you really like,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.830
what, what part of this kind of work do you

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.700
really enjoy. I think for some people it really is

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.290
the process of building things, of writing code, of building

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.470
a product that let's say you know, surfaces recommendations or finds,

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.990
you know similarities between users of a product. So you

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.720
know, if you really like that, that sort of aspect

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.180
of building things there's a lot you can do in

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.930
that direction particularly around improving

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.730
your coding skills, things like that.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.030
If you really enjoy the analysis part, the statistical and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.350
mathematical side of things, there's a lot more you can

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.700
do there in terms of coming up to speed with

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.680
new machine learning techniques, learning statistics more in depth. And then

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.030
finally, on the communications and strategies side there obviously a

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.060
lot that you can do to improve your communication still, skills.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.710
Understand how to abstract from the details, how to abstract

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.510
out the high level issues that are important to a company.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.280
So the first piece of advice I would really give anyone looking to move into

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.940
this field, is to understand which of those 3 areas you enjoy the most or what

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.710
the right mix is for you. And make sure you're focusing on the skills that, that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.670
will help you get ahead in the particular

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.330
direction that's of the best fit for you.
