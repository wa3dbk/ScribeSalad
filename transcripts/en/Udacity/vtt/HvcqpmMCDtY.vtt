00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.318
So here's another one for you to try out on your own. I've given you the

00:00:04.318 --> 00:00:08.520
expression 4 minus i divided by 1 plus 5 i. And I'd like you to go about

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.478
changing the denominator to a real number, so that you can eventually write this

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:17.791
number in the form a plus bi. Then fill your final answer into this box.
