you. If you were writing the Check Profanity program,

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.400
what steps would you take to get to the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.850

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.520
In simple English, just describe the steps you would

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.250
need to take to get to the output. Once

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.490
you have submitted your responses on the forum, make

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.210
