00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.692
If you recall from earlier in this unit, the way that we compacted an array of

00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:10.914
input elements was to compute the address for each of the input elements to be written into the output array,

00:00:10.914 --> 00:00:18.127
and then we would scatter these input elements using these scatter addresses into the output array.

00:00:18.127 --> 00:00:26.605
We've computed, for instance, that element 21 would be scattered by address 5 into output location 5.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.874
We're going to have the same goal here with merge, but we're going to use a different algorithm,

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:34.804
and our algorithm is going to rely on both of the input arrays being sorted.

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.374
So let's take a little bit of a closer look.

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:43.313
So, mentally, we're going to think about assigning 1 thread per input element in each of the 2 sorted lists.

00:00:43.313 --> 00:00:49.119
So in this example, we're going to merge 2 sorted sequences of 4 elements each,

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:54.156
so we would launch 8 threads, each of which would be responsible for 1 input element.

00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:57.795
So the goal of each thread is, just like the compact example,

00:00:57.795 --> 00:01:03.505
to calculate the position of its element in the final list and then scatter that element there.

00:01:03.505 --> 00:01:06.284
So, to start with, let's figure out what we are trying to do.

00:01:06.284 --> 00:01:11.473
What we're going to ask you to do is fill in the scatter addresses for these 2 sorts.

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:16.620
This is a very useful and common thing that you need to be able to do as you're building a parallel algorithm,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.454
understanding the scatter pattern that will let you get to the final answer.

00:01:20.454 --> 00:01:24.154
Since you're going to generate a dense sorted list of 8 elements,

00:01:24.154 --> 00:01:28.154
the scatter addresses in these 8 boxes are going to be the numbers from 0 to 7.
