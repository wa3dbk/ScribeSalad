00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.176
So you've seen functions written in the form f of x or g of u, or any other

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:08.674
number of things like this, h of y, so on and so forth. You can pick any letter

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:12.943
you want for the function name, and pretty much any letter you want for the

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:17.398
independent variable name too, as long as you're consistent. So taking all of

00:00:17.398 --> 00:00:22.924
that into account, what do you think this means? F of u comma v. Does this

00:00:22.924 --> 00:00:28.212
represent two separate functions? Two outputs for one input? A function with two

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:32.573
independent variables? Or a function with two dependent variables?
