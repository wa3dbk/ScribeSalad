00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:01.720
All right.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.880
Now that we've done a first pass through control flow,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.400
let's make some concerted effort to complete the work session,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.620
the required information for which you will find in the instructor's notes.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.850
You've already made your work object.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.670
Using any of the control flow patterns you've learned so

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.560
far, iterate through your work information,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.830
format the HTML with the proper templates, and append it to the page.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.080
Your work section should look like this when you're done.
