00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.320
We said there are two parts, we had to
define our access control policy and

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.220
then we have to do enforcement
based on what is in that policy.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.390
Clearly that policy defines who can
access what and things like that.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.380
That kind of information, we going to
abstract that in a data structure

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.220
that is called an Access Control Matrix,
or an ACM.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.810
If it's a matrix,
in this case an access control matrix,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.256
that is going to abstract all
the state that is relevant for

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.840
making those access control decisions.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.120
Well matrixes have rows and columns.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.010
To define a matrix you have to say
what rows it has, what kind of columns

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.478
it has, what does it store in each
element, or each cell of the matrix.

00:00:42.478 --> 00:00:46.460
In an accesss control matrix,
rows are defined by the users or

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.870
subjects that we have in the group.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.840
So rows actually correspond to the
sources of requests or the subjects or

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.610
the users.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.230
So this access control matrix,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.730
if Alice is a user in the system,
there is going to be a row for Alice.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.280
Well other thing that a matrix
has is to define this two

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.850
dimensional matrix we are talking about
is we have to define its columns.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.620
Rows correspond to users.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.200
Actually columns going to correspond to
resources that we have in the system.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.810
So each resource that
needs to be protected.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.740
Remember, we need to know who
is allowed to access it or not.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.910
So this matrix is sort of
telling you for a given user,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
that's a row, and a given resource or
object, what can be done.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.240
So the columns are going to
correspond to all the resources that

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.530
need to be protected in the system.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.359
So an access control matrix, since I'm
talking about rows and columns and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.690
it's two dimensions.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.790
Any particular entry, or cell,

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.620
in this matrix can be defined
by what we have here, [U, O],

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.260
with the row that is corresponds to
user U and the column for object O.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.565
You start with a user,

00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:58.350
continue until you get to the object
that we are talking about.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.111
So that element of the matrix or
cell of the matrix,

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:07.800
is actually going to define what kind of
access rights user U has for object O.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.630
So if this was a file, and the access
rights can be read/write, execute or

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.002
whatever subset of those access
rights then we're saying the entry

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:20.144
in the matrix,
if you look at the row for user U and

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:24.330
object O, it's going to say if
you can read this object O.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.190
R is present in that entry.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.080
That means the user can
read object O's matrix.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.810
Access control matrix is based
on users we have in the system,

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.250
resources we have in the system, and
the state actually it captures is

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.200
who had what kind of access for
the resources of the system.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.850
That's what each entry of the matrix
is going to answer a question for

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.000
a given user and
a given object or resource.
