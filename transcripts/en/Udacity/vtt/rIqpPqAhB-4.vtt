As you gain experience with game
development, you may find yourself

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:07.150
creating your own specialized tools,
maybe more than you'd expect.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.430
Sometimes there's just no better way to
convert a data file into the format you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.690
need or extract font data
to create a custom texture.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.420
One tool you commonly have
to write as a level editor

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.190
which can sometimes grow into
a full blown project of its own.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.600
If your game levels are big and

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.340
complex, a custom level editor can
end up saving time in the long run.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.765
And it makes it much easier to release
new content to keep your game fresh.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:32.430
It also allows others
to build levels for

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.650
your game which can be a great
way to engage your audience.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.640
It's still a good idea to represent your
levels with human readable data files.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.090
Because they tend to be
platform independent.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.760
And you also preserve the flexibility to
make changes with a simple text editor.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.660
You might choose to use binary data
files in production null to save space.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.020
And it's easy to add
a binary export function.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.040
If you write a dedicated level editor.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.380
I always enjoyed writing tools and
thought it was interesting how

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.030
tool development kind of happens in
reverse compared to the game itself.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.870
Tools are usually needed right away, so

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.710
there's a flurry of
coding activity up front.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.790
Games, on the other hand,
tend to gel at the end,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.180
it's all the individual
components come together.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.180
So, if you're creating a game,
and the tools used to build it.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.820
Well, you're going to be very
busy right from the start.
