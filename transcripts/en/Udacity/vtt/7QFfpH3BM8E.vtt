00:00:00.038 --> 00:00:01.784
We learned 3 algorithms today.

00:00:01.784 --> 00:00:04.255
We'll use all 3 in this week's homework,

00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:07.040
when we implement a procedure called tone mapping on an image.

00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:12.065
Generally, tone mapping is the process of converting one set of colors into another set of colors.

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:15.438
The reason we want to do this is typically to take a raw image that

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:19.448
accurately measures light intensity, and map it onto some physical medium, which

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:23.132
might be a piece of paper, or a television, or your computer monitor.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:26.426
The problem is that a real world scene can have brightnesses that span

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.897
many orders of magnitude and intensity.

00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:34.172
A piece of white paper in bright sunlight is literally a billion times brighter than on a dark night.

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:38.210
And an output device like a CRT can only represent about two orders of magnitude

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.789
between its brightest and least bright pixel.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.052
So, how do we do this mapping here?

00:00:43.052 --> 00:00:46.318
If we do a bad job, then we'll have images that are either too washed out,

00:00:46.318 --> 00:00:49.189
overly bright, or instead, overly dark.

00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:52.785
Let's take a quick look at some pictures to see why this is important.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.976
Here's a couple lovely images of old Saint Paul's in Wellington, New Zealand,

00:00:55.976 --> 00:00:59.552
licensed by the photographer Dean Pemberton, under the Creative Commons license.

00:00:59.552 --> 00:01:04.221
Thanks, Dean. What we see here are two different exposures of the interior of this building.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:09.203
If you look at the darker image here, you'll see most of it is quite dark and so it shows little detail.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:12.918
If we look at the brighter image, we see a lot more detail in some areas but bright

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:16.443
parts of the image, like the stained glass window, are completely washed out.

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:18.921
We can classify this in terms of histograms.

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:22.815
In the dark image, most of the pixels are at the low end of an intensity histogram.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.177
And in the light image, they're at the high end.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.971
What tone mapping does is it remaps those colors,

00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.081
so they do a better job spanning the entire color range.

00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:34.093
The intensity spectrum, thus, will look closer to this.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:39.546
In the homework, you'll implement a classic and excellent tone mapping algorithm developed by Greg Ward.

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:42.838
This algorithm uses all three of the algorithms you learned today,

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:46.932
reduce, scan, and histogram to implement such a tone mapping.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.452
Good luck, and we'll see you in the next unit.
