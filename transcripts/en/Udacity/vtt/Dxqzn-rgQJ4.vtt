There's in fact a look-at method on the camera itself, but most of the time, we

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:06.860
use the camera controls to let us move the camera around with the mouse. If you

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.105
run the exercise code, you'll see a grid and not much else. The drinking bird

00:00:10.105 --> 00:00:13.800
has left the view. Why did he leave? Where did he go? We've had word that he's

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.076
been sighted at these coordinates. Your job is to properly set the target to

00:00:17.076 --> 00:00:20.477
see what the bird's doing. You don't need to modify the camera's position or

00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:21.480
size itself.
