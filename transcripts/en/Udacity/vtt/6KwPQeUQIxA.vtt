00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
All right. Let's try another little quiz, but this one is going to move our understanding

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
forward a little bit more. Here's a little bit of Python code.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A subroutine called "countdown" takes an input x.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It executes a statement, and then it goes into a while loop

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and repeats these two statements some number of times.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Then when it's all done, it does one more statement.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We can take for any given input--like this print countdown 50--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
we could count up the time--the number of statements executed--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
for this to execute. It's going to be something like this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We didn't talk about the number of steps that it take to do a print statement if there's a subroutine,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but we're going to call it one for the print statement plus

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
however many steps it takes to execute the subroutine call.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In these case, countdown 50--what is it going to do?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There's going to be 1 call there, 2 for each time that it counts down,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
which is going to be--what--10 times, right?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It starts off at 50, going to go down by 5s until it hits 0.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There is going to be 10 times that it's executing these two statements.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's 20--21, 22, and the print statement is 23.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This--if we ask the time that this takes--is going to be 23 units.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here's the trickier question.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
What if we just say we don't know what n is. Someone is going to tell us n later.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're like to know the number of steps, the amount of time that it takes to execute this formula,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as a function of n.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We can't automatically grade a mathematical function--or maybe we can.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The way that we're going to score this quiz is instead

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of you telling me a mathematical expression for this function,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I want you to actually give me a function that takes as input n

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and produces as output the number of time steps that it will take to execute

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
countdown or this entire block of code here.

00:01:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
We already figured out what happens when n is 50, but we want a general form of this.
