00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.611
A complex number is any number that can be written in the form a plus bi, where

00:00:04.611 --> 00:00:09.324
a and b are real numbers. And, of course, i is just the square root of negative

00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:14.022
1. This fits with the number that we use as our motivation for coming up with

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:19.292
complex numbers in the first place. Remember that number was 3 plus 4i. So here,

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:25.176
a is 3 and b is 4. 3 and 4 are real numbers. So, this is perfect. That fits. 3

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:27.496
plus 4i is a complex number.
