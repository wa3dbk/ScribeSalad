00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
Say we have a prior of a Gaussian with a mean mu and covariance sigma squared,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.950
and our measurement has exactly the same mean and same covariance.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.450
Suppose we multiply both and get a new mean, which is the same as the old mean,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.000
and we get a new covarience, sigma squared,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which as you all know, corresponds to a more peaked Gaussian.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.750
I want you to express nu squared as a multiple of sigma squared.

00:00:32.750 --> 09:59:59.000
Just put the answer here as a real number.
