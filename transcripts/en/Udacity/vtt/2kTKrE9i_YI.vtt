00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
The domain of f of x equals 4x squared plus 6x is negative infinity to infinity.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.360
In other words, we can plug in any real number, literally any real number, in

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.276
place of x, in this function, and we'll get a valid value for f of x. Another

00:00:15.276 --> 00:00:19.836
way we could express this interval is to say that the domain of f of x is all

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:25.285
the real numbers. Remember that whenever we write an infinity sign, whether it

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:29.429
negative or positive, we need to have an open parenthesis.
