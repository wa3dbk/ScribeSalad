00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.920
So I'm almost ready to talk about how,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.440
what I did in this RecyclerView Part 3,
and that was to handle items, selection,

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.950
and choice, which is one of those
things that RecyclerView is missing.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.190
So what I did was I created this
thing called ItemChoiceManager, and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.970
this is not a complete implementation
of item choice and selection.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.380
It is liberally copied from what
ListView actually does internally, and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.270
you can see it actually uses a whole
bunch of ListView constants.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:34.010
But basically it takes advantage
of sparse pooling arrays and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.000
long sparse arrays and it, to store the
check states and the checked ID states.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.720
And the big code that it probably, you
know, takes the most from ListView is

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.020
actually how it deals with
checking positions by ID.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.780
This list I did not write for this.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.560
Now, this is actually fairly
complicated if you see what it's doing.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.220
It checks for nearby IDs and
searches through the list

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.590
to try to confirm these check positions,
and I think this kind of code is one of

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.760
the reasons why the framework team
was happy to see this functionality

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.520
taken out of RecyclerView, because
it is really tricky to implement.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.620
And what we do actually for this,

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.730
we need to know when
the ViewHolder is bound.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.930
So what we do is we actually have this
work together in conjunction with

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.400
the code that is in
the forecast adaptor.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.010
In fact, in a weird way, this is sort of
a helper for the forecast adaptor far

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.920
more than it is actually a helper for
RecyclerView.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.890
It also does a couple
of nice things here.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.360
It actually restores and
saves instance states.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.840
This I did right, mostly because I was,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.710
I wanted to kind of
automatically do this.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.410
And we don't automatically have a way of
saving these sparse arrays into bundles,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.110
but we do have the way,
a way of saving them into parcels.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.490
So I just implemented that here.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.340
Just another function
that can be called, so

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.820
that we are saving these checked items.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.291
And then finally,
getSelectedItemPosition,

00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:10.904
very similar to ListView, returns
the first item that is selected, so

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:14.160
if you have multiple items like it,
it will return one.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.640
Otherwise, it will return zero.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.041
I did not implement the modal selection
stuff, so there is none of this,

00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:23.320
you know, choiceMode multiple or
whatever.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.750
But I do support a multiple modal here,
and you get an exception if you try to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.330
use it, but
it does support both multiple and

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.260
single choice, basically adding that
functionality into RecyclerView.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.940
And then so
the interesting stuff, of course,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.150
is also what happens
inside of ForecastAdapter.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.640
And this is pretty straightforward.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.660
Whenever we bind the ViewHolder,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.020
we also have to make sure that
we call ICM.onBindViewHolder,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.300
same thing with onRestoreInstanceState
and on SaveInstanceState.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.830
And we also added some helper functions,
so that other things

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.710
didn't have to call all the way in and
get access to the ItemChoiceManager.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.270
So, like, getSelectedItemPosition,
et cetera, et cetera, is also supported.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.310
We also added this nice
selectView function here.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.050
And this is used to
implement a feature that I

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.250
thought was really really important.

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.440
And so it's one of the other things
I sort of slid into this one.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.230
We have this concept of
auto selecting a view.

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.255
I kind of threw that in here,

00:03:22.255 --> 00:03:24.380
because it was really unfortunate
to have views showing up.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.860
So what I do is I wait to
see that we have children,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.504
like we've been doing with
these OnPreDrawListeners, and

00:03:30.504 --> 00:03:34.628
then once I know we have children,
then I go in SelectView,

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:39.110
either the position, if there already
is one, or if there isn't a position,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.020
then we go and select the first one,
so that we have something selected,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.810
which just looks a lot nicer
when you're in tablet mode.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.687
So this is just a trick or a hack or a,
you know, reasonable way of doing it,

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:53.397
depending on how you want
to look at things, but, so

00:03:53.397 --> 00:03:55.615
we're also taking advantage of that, and

00:03:55.615 --> 00:03:59.560
that's the reason why we exposed
that SelectView functionality.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.970
And other than that, it, you know,
looks pretty nice, works pretty well.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.960
So that's a big piece of RecyclerView.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.210
Now, the reason I didn't teach this, and
I didn't have you guys code this up,

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.300
is because I expect, in the next year or
so, we're going to have a better

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.065
solution if we're doing this kind of
item selection within RecyclerView.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:18.470
RecyclerView is under heavy development,
and

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.990
there's all sorts of great stuff that's
gone into it in the last six months.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.950
And I suspect more and
more of these things that are missing

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.830
from ListView are actually going to be
in RecyclerView in one way or another.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.990
So here is my stat at doing
it in a reasonable way.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.180
Perhaps the framework team will
come up with something better.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.260
So that is finishing our
work on RecyclerView.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.960
Again, you know,
take a look at those changes.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.650
There's some interesting code in there.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.460
The next thing we're going to get
into is scrolling in parallel.
