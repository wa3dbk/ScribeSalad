00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.510
Now because the tablet is at
the baseline density, its physical and

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.260
density independent pixel sizes
are the same, 1280 by 800.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.820
This phone, on the other hand,
has a higher pixel density, so

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.059
it has half as many density
independent pixels as physical pixels.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.410
So 400 by 640 density
independent pixels.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.850
Now using density independent pixels
makes it easier to mentally picture,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.930
that you have much more space on this
tablet than you do on this phone.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.960
Similarly, if you have two devices
with similar screen sizes but

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.030
different pixel densities.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.710
One is, let's say, 800 by 1280 pixels,
and the other is 400 by 640 pixels,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.540
you might think that you have to
design totally different layouts for

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.410
the two of these devices.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.030
However, when you think of the screens
in terms of density independent pixels,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.590
they are the same size.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.500
They are both 400 by 640 dps.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.740
This makes it a lot easier
to make layout decisions.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.340
You don't have to design
completely separate layouts.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.470
You basically just design once, and

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.769
you'll kind of use the same layout
across both of these types of screens.
