00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.798
Now I have a few very tricky questions which doesn't require you to calculate

00:00:03.798 --> 00:00:09.052
the correlation coefficients but you really need to think about these. Let's

00:00:09.052 --> 00:00:15.690
say that the x variable is age in years and the y variable is age in months.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.782
For example, if we plotted all students' age in years on the x axis and their

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:25.901
age in months on the y axis. What would the correlation coefficient be?
