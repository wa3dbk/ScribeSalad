00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And this time we only have one correct answer,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
which is this one up here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So once we know that SAT is NP-complete

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and we wanted to show that those three problems,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
vertex cover, independent SET, and clique are NP-complete as well,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we would have to show that if we take any input for SAT,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
then we can transform it into one of

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
those three problems up here and then solve that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because that shows us that in a way vertex cover or independent SET

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
or clique are at least as hard to solve as SAT.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And because SAT is NP-complete,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
if one of these problems is at least as hard to solve,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
then that problem must be NP-complete as well.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
These two down here are the wrong way around

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because SAT is NP-complete,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which means that this is one of the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
hardest problems that you will find in NP,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
so just showing that for example,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you could take vertex cover and transform it into an input for SAT

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
would only show you that SAT is at least as hard to solve as vertex cover,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but that is the wrong way around,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because we want to show that vertex cover is at least as hard to solve as SAT,

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
so those two answers down here are not correct.
