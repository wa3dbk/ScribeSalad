00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.310
Principal components.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.190
So, fundamentally, principal
components are about the directions.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.150
The component is really a direction in
a featured space along which the points

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.040
that you care about in that space have
the greatest variation or variants.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.420
We'll make all of this more formal,
in a minute.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.240
So, the first, it says PC here,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.380
first principal component,
is the direction of maximum variance.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.310
Now a quick word of warning.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.410
You see here, I've got this little
symbol here that indicates that's where

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200
the mean of the points is.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.270
Principal components is mathematically
defined about the origin.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.730
So what we typically do is we talk
about moving all of the points

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.650
to have their mean at the origin.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.846
But then we forget that it's doing that,
we have to do it in the math and

00:00:47.846 --> 00:00:51.115
we would draw something like this and
say you see this?

00:00:51.115 --> 00:00:56.245
This direction, that's the first
principle component of those points.

00:00:56.245 --> 00:00:58.335
It's the direction of maximum variance.

00:00:58.335 --> 00:01:00.322
They're not around the origin here so

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.426
we have to shift it actually
before we do the computation but

00:01:03.426 --> 00:01:07.273
when we think about it we're only
talking about with respect to the mean,

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:11.309
and the subsequent principle components
are perpendicular or orthogonal to

00:01:11.309 --> 00:01:15.000
the previous ones, and describe
a next greatest amount of variance.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.207
Now, in two dimensions,
we're sort of done, right?

00:01:18.207 --> 00:01:19.917
So, we say, well, that's the first one.

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:23.890
Well, the next one's gotta be there,
because there's only two dimensions so

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.400
it's gotta go to that direction.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.315
But if I was in three dimensions,
I would have my first dimension and

00:01:28.315 --> 00:01:31.846
then everything would be along there, so
I could remove that, collapse it down on

00:01:31.846 --> 00:01:35.324
a plane, let's say in that plane, what's
the maximum variation that will be my

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:38.170
second one, and then I would have
the third one that will be left.
