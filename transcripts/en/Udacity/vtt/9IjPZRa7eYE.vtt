00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.930
For the first one, we just get 31,000. For 3.1 times 10 to the 10, we get this

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.050
much longer number. It's 3, 1, and then 9 0s. This is 31 billion, in fact. For

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.910
this last one, 3.1 times 10 to the 21, we get a kind of funny answer though.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.680
When I type this in, and then press Enter, we get 3.1 I don't know what this

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.554
means. Well this is actually just how the calculator shows, 3.1 times 10 to the

00:00:30.554 --> 00:00:35.550
21st. This e is not the special number that we met in the last lesson. E here

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.150
just stands for exponent. And it means the exponent of 10 is 21. And if there's

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.540
a positive sign here, that's just to distinguish this from negative 21. Some

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.570
calculator show this differently. So check yours to see what it displays, when

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.940
you enter the same number. Also as a challenge, see if you can guess how you'd

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.820
write this number in the same format as these other two we already saw. How

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.449
many digit's do you think it has?
