00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.394
We can use our knowledge of canceling factors to help us simplify rational

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:07.395
expressions. We simplify a rational expression the same way that we simply

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:11.570
fractions. We just need to cancel the factors that appear in the numerator and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.700
the denominator since the factors reduced to 1. We can use these steps for any

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.428
rational expression we encounter. So let's start off with this one. I want you

00:00:20.428 --> 00:00:25.493
to factor the numerator and the denominator in the set here.
