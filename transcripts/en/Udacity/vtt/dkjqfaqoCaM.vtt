00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.220
If you've watched any of the other
interviews I've done here at Udacity

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.800
you'll notice that I'm in
the other chair today,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.330
and that's because we're talking about
a topic that is very important to me.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.730
My dissertation research was on using
an intelligent tutoring system in

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.876
an exploratory learning environment
to teach students meta-cognition.

00:00:14.876 --> 00:00:18.390
And meta-cognition is really the thing
I'm ultimately most interested in, so

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.780
I'll be talking about that today.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.240
Also, Jason has again agreed to give me
my questions for this little interview.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.570
&gt;&gt; All right David, let's get started.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.140
Why do you have so
much interest in meta-cognition?

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.170
&gt;&gt; So the main reason I have a lot
of interest in meta-cognition

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.330
is that there's actually research,
that you've probably covered so

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.940
far in this lesson,
that shows that meta-cognition

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.190
is the chief determinant in
students success going forward.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.250
That if there's on thing we can
teach them, that will really

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.400
ensure that they're successful in later
academic career, it's meta-cognition.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.980
It's thinking about how do I learn,
what are the best processes for me?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.010
How do I monitor that when I'm trying
to learn something if I'm struggling.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.623
Instead of just continuing
to just struggle and

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:55.300
assume that there's something wrong
with me if I can't learn this material.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.184
How can I actually reflect on this,
and say what is it about this that I'm

00:00:58.184 --> 00:01:00.590
struggling with, and
how can I adjust for that?

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.140
So to really treat the learning
process as a first class object.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.050
Really think about that as a part of the
learning, that the process is something

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.460
that I can control,
that I get to drive my own learning.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.970
And this is really important because,
it's kind of that old principle,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.010
if you teach a man to fish,
he'll eat for a lifetime.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.300
If you teach a person to learn,
they'll learn for a lifetime.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.566
Many times in education we're focused
on teaching students some material, and

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.840
the material is very important and
I would never insult that.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.841
But if you teach a student
to learn in general,

00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:31.355
that's really going to help
them later in their life, and

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:34.330
that's the main reason I'm most
interested in meta-cognition.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.920
I think that philosophically, it's what
really determines students success, and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.170
there's also empirical
evidence that says that.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.230
A student's mindset towards learning
is what will determine whether or

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.020
not they're successful at new
things that they come across.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.210
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.
That's pretty powerful.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.250
are some of the main challenges in
teaching students about meta-cognition?

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.120
&gt;&gt; So the main challenge is
that meta-cognition by its very

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.610
definition is inside the head.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.680
It's I'm thinking about my own thinking.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.730
So the thinking is inside the head, but
at least when I'm thinking about like

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.300
the cameras that are in front of me,
I can think about how they work.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.010
I can reason about them physically.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.880
I can reach out.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.520
I can adjust them.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.758
I can manipulate them.

00:02:08.758 --> 00:02:11.390
When I'm thinking about thinking, I'm
thinking about something that's inside

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.450
my head as well, and so
if I'm teaching somebody algebra,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.210
I can look at the output
of what they're doing.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.334
But with meta-cognition,

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:21.360
I'm not looking explicitly on
the output of their meta-cognition.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.284
I'm looking at the output of
the thought that was reasoned over, so

00:02:24.284 --> 00:02:27.517
there's a couple layers of separation
away, we're talking so much about

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:31.085
thinking about thinking, it's a little
bit hard to even have the conversation.

00:02:31.085 --> 00:02:33.029
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That's part of the reason why it's so

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.590
difficult, is that,
what are we thinking about and when.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.060
So that's part of the difficulty.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.020
But because we're not operating
on something that we can see,

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.590
we're kind of feeling around in
the dark, and we're trying to figure out

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.020
what a person is really thinking
underneath the hood, so to speak.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.350
Can I look at the things that you're
actually outputting, or saying, or

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.490
writing, and
use that to infer something about

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.300
the meta-cognition that went into it,
and it's very difficult.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.790
And it's difficult for human tutors,
for AI tutors it's even more difficult,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.110
because they don't have the benefit
of all the information that we have.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.705
They don't have the nat's of the human
empathy that I think a lot of teaching

00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.810
meta-cognition to another person is
that you're a person, I'm a person.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.870
To a certain extent,
I can put myself inside your mind, and

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.510
I can kind of re-simulate that.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.640
Computers have no natural
ability to do that.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.470
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So even just building in

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.950
human empathy, or human thought,
or human, approaches to problems,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.580
is part of being able to teach them
to do, to teach meta-cognition.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.610
So yeah, the main reason it's difficult
is what we're operating on is invisible,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.890
and it's not easy to manipulate
something you can't see.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.850
&gt;&gt; For sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.140
&gt;&gt; How can technology foster
meta-cognitive development?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.630
&gt;&gt; So even the main thing that we first
have to wrestle with is exactly the same

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.090
issue that I mentioned before.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.750
The main challenge to facilitating
meta-cognitive development

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900
is making the invisible visible.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.355
&gt;&gt; Right
&gt;&gt; Taking what's invisible

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:51.680
inside the brain and putting it out
on the page, putting it in software,

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.760
somewhere like that.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.280
And so the way we can do that, is by
structuring the environment in which

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.310
this development takes place, such that
students have to make that explicit.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.975
So one way we can do it is by
asking them to do what we call

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:07.860
think-aloud protocol, which is where
they go through an activity and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.930
just think aloud about it.

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.730
It's not the best approach because
research has shown that, when I ask you,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.240
while you're doing whatever you're about
to do, tell me what you're thinking?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.253
It actually changes the way you think,
and so I don't get at the root of what

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:23.840
you would really think if you
weren't actively reflecting on it.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.103
But at the same time it gives you
a learning experience of making your

00:04:27.103 --> 00:04:30.194
own thought process explicit,
which is very valuable that even

00:04:30.194 --> 00:04:33.420
sometimes just making students
aware of what they're thinking.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.316
Even if we're not entirely sure what
they're actually thinking, just forcing

00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:39.560
them to reflect on it can be the most
valuable learning experience of all.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.950
But in my dissertation research,
what I ended up doing was taking

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.180
a certain part of the activity
that students were completing and

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.080
asking them to output that to the page.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.190
So it was constructing theories to
explain natural phenomenon, and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.330
part of that is why do I
believe what I believe.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:56.550
That's part of meta-cognition,

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.940
is reflecting on the internal
reasons that underly my beliefs.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.310
And so we took that and basically said,
take whatever it is that makes you

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.380
believe what you're currently believing,
and put it on the page.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.510
Code it in a certain way as a kind
of classification system of saying

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.050
this is an example of
this kind of belief,

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.630
this is an example of this kind
of belief, and put it out there.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.280
So we're making explicit, something
about the meta-cognitive process.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.360
It's not always easy.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.180
Actually, it's never easy, but
it's not always impossible, but for

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.010
certain domains, we can do some
things where students are asked

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.310
to make their meta-cognitive
process explicit.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.720
And in fact, it's something that we do,
I think, really strongly in this class,

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.950
or at least we try to,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.360
which is take the way you think about
the course material and externalize it.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.216
Externalize it into context
to your own problems.

00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:41.989
Externalize it in the context of the
solution that you'd like to develop, and

00:05:41.989 --> 00:05:42.650
share that with your classmates.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.083
And in that way, you're sharing a little
bit about how you approach the problem,

00:05:46.083 --> 00:05:49.219
and how you're thinking about a problem
with others to get feedback on your

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.290
meta-cognition a little
bit more explicitly.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.392
Again, not easy, and I don't think I
could even begin to imagine right now

00:05:55.392 --> 00:05:59.380
how I might design an AI agent to be
a TA, or an instructor for this class.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.182
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; But maybe several years from now,

00:06:02.182 --> 00:06:06.670
based on a project that someone in this
class starts to develop, we might start

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.890
to see a meta-cognitive agent that's
more than just a tutor, or guide.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:15.300
It's actually kind of a partner, or
a mentor in an environment like this.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.608
It can mimic some of the things that it
wants you to learn to do, which I think

00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:22.300
is really the best approach for teaching
meta-cognition, is to demonstrate it.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.191
To show, this is how I would think
about this problem that you might want

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:26.430
to think about this way, so.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.900
&gt;&gt; That's fascinating.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you again, Jason, for
interviewing me on another topic.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.920
&gt;&gt; Of course, dude.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.010
&gt;&gt; And thank y'all.
