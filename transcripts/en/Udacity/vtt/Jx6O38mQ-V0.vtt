00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.340
So far we are focused largely
on message confidentiality.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.500
What if we want to protect
message integrity.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.120
That is, we want to prevent or

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.700
detect any unauthorized
modification to the message.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.130
One standard approach is to
send the last block of CBC,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.280
also called a CBC residue,
along with a plain text.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.450
Now, if an attacker
intercepts the message and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.160
modify the plain text, the attacker
does not have the correct key, therefore

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.130
he cannot compute a correct CBC
residue with the modified plain text.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.600
So he's forced to resend the modified
plain text with original CBC residue.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.640
The CBC residue that the receiver
computes on the modified plaintext

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.010
will not be the same as the CBC
residue that he receives.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.940
Therefore, the receiver would know
that the plaintext has been modified.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.270
In other words, the CBC residue provides
a protection of message integrity.
