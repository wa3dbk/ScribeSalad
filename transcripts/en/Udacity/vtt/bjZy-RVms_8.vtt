00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let me ask you a few questions.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We had measurement updates and motion updates.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In the measurement update, we computed posterior over state

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
given the measurement.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it was proportional to - after normalization -

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of probability of the measurement,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
given the state times "p" of the state itself.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In the motion update, if you compute

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a posterior of the distribution one time step later

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and that is the convolution of the transition probability

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
times my prior.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now those formulas--those should look familiar.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This is exactly what you implemented.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You might not know you implemented this; let me explain

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to you how you implemented it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This distribution was a set of particles.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
A thousand particles, together, represented your prior "x".

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
These were importance weights.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And technically speaking, the particles

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
with the importance weights

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
are a representation of distribution.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But we wanted to get rid of the importance weights

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so by resampling, we work the importance weights

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
back into the set of particle so the resulting particles--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the ones over here--would represent the correct posterior.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You've implemented this.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I'm just telling you what the math is behind this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
This, you also implemented.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This was your set of particles again,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and you sampled from the sum

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
by taking a random particle over here

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and applying the motion model with a noise model

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to generate a random particle, "x-prime".

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
As a result, you get a new particle set

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that is the correct distribution after the robot motion.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So you recognize the math, and hopefully

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you understand how your code implements this math.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You can prove all kinds of interesting facts about this math.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
For example, you can prove convergence if the number of particles goes to infinity.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It is obviously approximate.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Particles are not an exact representation.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And it was amazingly easy to program.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So when you go over your particle code

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
you realize you implemented a fairly involved

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
piece of math that is actually the same

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
for all the filters we talked about so far.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The same math underlies our histogram filter

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
we talked about in Class No. 1.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And the same math for Gaussians

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
is the Kalman filter we talked in Class No. 2.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So let me ask you an interesting question.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Which of the 3 filters did Sebastian use

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in his Job Talk at Stanford?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Histogram Filters, Kalman filters,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Particle Filters or None of the above?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Check one or all that apply

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and, of course, you can't really know unless

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
you Google me and look up my Home Page.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Then you might find out some evidence.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So just take a random guess

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and I'll tell you the answer in a second.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I should say I was hired by Stanford,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
in 2003, into a tenured Associate Professor position

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.941
so obviously my Job Talk wasn't that bad.
