00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.379
Well I think this one is the best metric, for determining how good I am. Because

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.603
most people, when I tell them that I'm rated 1800, they don't really know what

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:13.007
that means. Because we don't know the scale, what's the lowest rating and what's

00:00:13.007 --> 00:00:17.167
the highest rating, how many people are rated about 1800, how many people are

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:22.401
rated 1,000? This number alone doesn't give us much information. Same with this

00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:27.389
number. We know that approximately 8,000 people are probably better than me but

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:32.151
how many people even play chess? However, the percentage tells us a lot. And

00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:36.665
that's why the shape of a distribution is even more important than simply

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:40.897
figuring out whether the mean, median or mode are the best metrics.
