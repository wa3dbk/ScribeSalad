00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.550
You now have a pretty good idea of how to start working on a new project.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.010
But what's the best way to learn new skills aside from just practice,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.100
practice, practice?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.700
I think Jacques has some ideas but

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.650
again he went back to work so we need to bug him again.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.030
&gt;&gt; Heya, so I actually wanted to just mention the awesomeness that

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.820
is learning HTML and CSS on the web when you can see it every day.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.174
So if you like something in a webpage, and you want to see how they did it

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:37.510
[COUGH] you can pop open DevTools and actually see how we cut it up.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.460
So if you like something on the audacity website, and

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.850
you want to use that motif, or

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.000
that design, those type of styles, you can see what we did.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.620
And that's really great, and

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.280
not something you can do in a lot of other environments.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.060
So in terms of learning, it's a great place to start.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.580
Because, I mean, that's how I started.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.250
I was looking at how other people did,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.560
how other people coded up their solutions.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.270
How they managed to make something look a certain way and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.510
being able to open it up.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.770
And our DevTools are much better now.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.530
And they will really allow you to dive into how somebody put something together.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.890
So go and check out a website that you find interesting.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.550
You'll, you'll be amazed that, sort of what people have done and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.020
you can learn a tremendous amount from it.
