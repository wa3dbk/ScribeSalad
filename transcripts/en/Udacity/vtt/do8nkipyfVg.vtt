00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.482
This time, we're not solving for x since there's no x in our equation. Instead,

00:00:04.482 --> 00:00:08.844
we're solving for c, since c stands for the price per wiper set. We want to know

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:12.862
what values of c will make p equals 0. Now, this is in a general form for a

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:17.334
quadratic equation. That means, we can use the quadratic formula. And this may

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:21.346
be a little bit confusing because our variable is called c and what we do

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:26.139
usually refer to this constant term at the end as c. What's really important

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:31.221
though, isn't what we call these constants, rather, it's where we place them in

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:35.895
the quadratic formula. Once we have this all written out, we just need to

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:40.768
simplify and solve. Simplifying gives us these numbers. C equals negative

00:00:40.768 --> 00:00:45.657
18,400, plus or minus the square root of 232 million, all over negative 400.

00:00:45.657 --> 00:00:50.083
This is one of those moments where I'm very grateful for calculators as much as

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.503
I really do think it's important for people to be able to manipulate numbers on

00:00:54.503 --> 00:00:58.864
their own. But I can't figure out the square root of 232 million in my head.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:03.129
Because of the plus or minus, this is going to split into two answers for c.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.555
Now, we can simplify what's under the square root and also divide both terms in

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:12.236
the numerators by negative 400. So, we get 46 minus 5 root 58 and 46 plus 5

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:17.828
square root 58. Let's look at the decimal approximations of each of these. The

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:23.226
first one is about equal to 7.92. And the second is about equal to 84.08. So,

00:01:23.226 --> 00:01:28.604
these are our 2 solutions. Let's check out the graph for a second. So, here's

00:01:28.604 --> 00:01:34.230
the graph of our equation for Grant's profit. P equals negative 200c squared

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.077
plus 18,400c minus 133,200. This is this lovely curve we've seen several times

00:01:40.077 --> 00:01:45.428
now. Please note, of course, the scale on either axis. These bolder vertical

00:01:45.428 --> 00:01:50.636
lines each mark 20 units or $20, and these bold horizontal lines, each mark

00:01:50.636 --> 00:01:56.020
$50,000. So, let's look at our x-intercepts, and yes, this one does look like

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.307
it's just before 10. So, $7.92 makes sense or 7.92, for this point. This one is

00:02:01.307 --> 00:02:06.531
just past 80, so $84.08 makes sense as well. So, let's keep in mind what we're

00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:11.366
actually doing in problems like this. When we start with an equation for a

00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:16.241
parabola like this one, if we want to find the location of its x-intercepts, we

00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:20.816
can set the vertical coordinate equal to 0 since that's what's true at the

00:02:20.816 --> 00:02:25.939
x-axis or the horizontal axis, the c-axis in the case of this problem. And then,

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.259
when we set that vertical coordinate equal to 0, we can use the quadratic

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:35.042
formula to solve provided that the rest of the equation is in the proper form.

00:02:35.043 --> 00:02:39.621
The quadratic formula gives us the horizontal coordinates of those points that

00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:43.954
have a vertical coordinate of 0. In other words, it gives us the x-coordinates

00:02:43.954 --> 00:02:48.261
of the x-intercepts. Or in this case, the c-coordinates of the c-intercepts.
