00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.440
So at this point,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.560
you've seen information about sessions
on the movie database website, and

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.250
heard about the movie database
authorization flow from Travis himself.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.930
But once we start writing code for this,
things can get a little complicated.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.250
So to get a good idea of
the organization of all of this and

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.690
how it will work in the app,

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.970
let's look at a flow chart that
describes how a user will log in.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.410
The first thing we'll need to
do is get a request token.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.210
Once we have that we're
going to login with the API and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.140
then we can create a session ID.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.630
Remember for the movie database,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.200
we need a session to make any
requests that write or update data.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.090
Finally, we'll grab the user ID and
we can then move on to the next view.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.160
Now we can see from the arrows that
these steps need to happen in a specific

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
order and we wouldn't want to move
onto the new step before our current

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.140
step is finished.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.730
It's for that reason that, in our code,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.130
we're going to keep these
steps chained together,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.970
meaning we'll move onto the next one
only after our current step completes.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.860
This means checking each time that
we have the value we're expecting

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.950
when a step completes, and printing or
displaying an error if we don't.
