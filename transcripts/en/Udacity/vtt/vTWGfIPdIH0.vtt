00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.607
Let's make some more of these right triangles
in this first quadrant.

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.826
Here is another red triangle

00:00:05.826 --> 00:00:08.479
and here is another one as well.

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.823
So, notice I have four different red triangles 
in the first quadrant

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:16.018
and they are all related by the Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:16.018 --> 00:00:19.859
The length of the string is fifty centimeters
in each case.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.500
So that means the hypotenuses of each right triangle
is fifty centimeters.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.131
But let's create a right triangle in this quadrant.

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:30.338
If I had this right triangle

00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.875
what would be the coordinates of the end 
of the string now?

00:00:33.875 --> 00:00:37.876
Write the coordinates for this position here.
