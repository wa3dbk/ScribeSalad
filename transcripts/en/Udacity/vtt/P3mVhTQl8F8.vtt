00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.268
Let me tell you about a useful concept that you can use to organize your

00:00:03.268 --> 00:00:08.773
classes effectively. It's called the concept of coupling. And we'll say that a

00:00:08.773 --> 00:00:12.982
class is coupled with another if it uses the other class. In fact,

00:00:12.982 --> 00:00:13.628
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:13.628 --> 00:00:19.154
shows us this relationship, with these arrows that you may have noticed before.

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:24.478
In this example, the Car class. Is coupled with a Person class, because the

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:29.610
code of the Car class uses personal objects. But the Person class is not

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.164
coupled with the Car class because the personal object actually knows nothing

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:39.771
about cars. Let me show you. When you look at the code of the Person class

00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:44.049
you'll see there are no cars inside, but when you look at the code for the Car

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:52.300
class, there's a person here, and a Person class is used up here. Like I said,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.756
the Car class knows about the Person class, but the Person class doesn't know

00:00:55.756 --> 00:01:00.119
about the Car class. It's a good idea if not every class knows about every

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:04.965
other, it makes it easier to make changes. For example, if we make a change in

00:01:04.965 --> 00:01:10.284
the Car class, the Person class doesn't care. It never knew the class in the

00:01:10.284 --> 00:01:15.610
first place. One wants to keep the coupling between classes as low as possible.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.740
Let's see what other classes the Car class might be coupled with. Go ahead, go

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.814
through the code of the Car class, and give me a list of all of the classes

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:32.610
that the Car class uses. Just put the names of the classes into this box.
