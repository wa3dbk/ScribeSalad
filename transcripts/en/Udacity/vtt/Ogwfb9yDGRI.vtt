00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.041
Remember that in order to add 3x and 6x
together, I simply added their

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:08.665
coefficients and then multiplied by the
variable they both contain to get 9x,

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:13.485
since 3 plus 6 is 9, and the variable in
both terms is x. We can do the same thing

00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:19.595
to deal with the y terms over here. So
negative 5y plus 9y is going to be equal

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:25.449
to whatever negative 5 plus 9 is times y.
We know that negative 5 plus 9 is equal to

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.564
4. So our answer is 4y. And we can fill
that in the box. Over here in our original

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:37.235
expression, we have four different terms.
And over here, we only have two terms.

00:00:37.562 --> 00:00:41.475
This is why we call this simplifying
expressions. This expression is way more

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:45.555
simple than the one over here is. Remember
that I was allowed to put an equal sign

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:49.444
here, between these two expressions,
because they are exactly mathematically

00:00:49.444 --> 00:00:53.650
equivalent. In order to come up with the
expression over here, I only played with

00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:57.710
the terms inside of this expression. I
didn't bring anything in from the outside.

00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:00.807
The only way I modified it was by
squishing together things that were

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:01.392
already there.
