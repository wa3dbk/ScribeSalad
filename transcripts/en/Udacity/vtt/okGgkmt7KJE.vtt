00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.666
We know that we're going to need to complete the square to this equation for a

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:07.558
parabola that's in standard form right now to be in vertex form eventually. So

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:11.334
the first step to do that is to first check out whether or not the expression we

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:15.169
have on the right side of our equation, the expression involving x, is in fact a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.170
perfect square right now. To my knowledge there's nothing that we can multiply

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.026
by itself, or at least nothing pretty, to get this. So we're going to add 15 to

00:00:23.026 --> 00:00:27.122
both sides so that we can pick our own constant complete the square with On the

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:31.243
right side. So that gives us y plus 15 equals negative 6 x squared plus 20. And

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:35.087
since we have a leading coefficient over here that is not equal to 1 I need to

00:00:35.087 --> 00:00:38.931
factor out that leading coefficient so that the right side of our equation

00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:42.899
eventually has the form of a coefficient times some binomial where x with the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.064
coefficient of 1 is the first term. So I simply factor out the negative 6 from

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:51.085
both terms on the right side. Then we need to figure out what constant term to

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:55.240
add. This expression inside the parentheses, to make it a perfect square. Since

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.888
I know that when I have a binomial squared, the coefficient of the middle term

00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:02.603
is just twice the number that we have as the second term in the binomial. We can

00:01:02.603 --> 00:01:06.379
find the constant that we're adding to the end by dividing The coefficient of

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:09.978
the x to the first term by 2, then I need to square it since I have C squared as

00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:13.779
the coefficient on the end over here in our multiplied out polynomial. That

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:17.438
gives me 25 over 9. Subsets belong inside the parentheses here, but it's not

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:21.532
actually the number that we;re adding to both sides of the equation. That number

00:01:21.532 --> 00:01:26.225
is going to be negative 6 times 25 over 9. It looks like I forgot my negative

00:01:26.225 --> 00:01:31.086
signs here. let's multiply 25 over 9 by negative 6 gives me negative 50 over 3.

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:35.960
So that's the number that we need to add to both sides. Once I subtract 50 over

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.657
3 from both sides, all we need to do is simplify this or modify it so we get it

00:01:40.657 --> 00:01:45.622
into vertex form. Our final equation in vertex form then is y minus five thirds

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:50.832
equals negative 6. Times x minus 5 thirds squared. Where is our vertex then?

00:01:50.832 --> 00:01:54.926
Well, we can read it off. It's at the point 5 thirds, 5 thirds.
