00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.162
As before, we're just going to substitute four in for x in the original

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:11.020
function. So we're going to end up with 4 squared with is just equal to 16. So

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.397
our input of four spits out an output of 16. And once again this creates a point

00:00:16.397 --> 00:00:20.536
for us that we can plot a 4 comma 16. This lies on the graph of f of x equals x

00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:25.002
squared. Which incidentally is a problem you know very well. So the way that the

00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:29.913
graphs of these functions look hasn't changed at all. From when we used to write

00:00:29.913 --> 00:00:34.438
them with y's instead of f of x. So the graph of y equals x squared is exactly

00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:38.562
the same as the graph of f of x equals x squared. Writing with this notation

00:00:38.562 --> 00:00:42.718
just underscores the fact that this is a function. This has that special

00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:47.816
property of having only one y value for every x value that we can plug in. And

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:53.486
it also shows that the vertical values on this graph are dependent, upon the

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.026
horizontal values.
