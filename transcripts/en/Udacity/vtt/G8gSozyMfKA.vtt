00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.040
We've used the LS command or
application a few times already, and

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.552
we know that it's located within
the slash bin directory, but

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:11.279
how come we didn't have to type
the full path to this file to run it?

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.610
Why didn't we have to type /bin/ls?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.546
Linux systems provide a nice little
short cut system within the dollar sign

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:19.980
path variable.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.930
Let's take a look at that and

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.690
figure out how the operating
system saves us some typing.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.567
If you type echo $PATH and you run that,

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:32.670
you're presented with a bunch of
paths separated by colon characters.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.920
We see /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin
and on and on and on.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.740
These are actually the directories
Linux will progress through looking for

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.120
a binary when you just type
the name of it like ls.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.960
When you type ls, the operating
system checks the first directory for

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.230
an executable file names ls.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.680
If it's not there, it checks the next.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.946
And on and on and
on until it gets here to /bin.

00:00:58.946 --> 00:01:01.400
And it does find that file,
so it runs it.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.650
If you ever find that your
commands aren't being found, or

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.040
things are just acting really crazy,
you might want to check this variable.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.840
I've placed a link in the instructor
notes that will walk you through how to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.770
edit this variable and
save it if need be.
