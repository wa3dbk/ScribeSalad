00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.001
Let's go through the wire frames
for the Settings UI.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.808
Within the detail activity 
in the overflow menu,

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:07.670
there's a Settings menu item.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.755
When you tap on the Settings' menu item,
it opens up the settings activity.

00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:14.495
If you tap of location, 
it pops up a dialog,

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:17.063
where you can enter in your postal code.

00:00:17.078 --> 00:00:21.801
Feel free to use your preferred method
for inputting location, such as city name.

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:24.667
Just verify that the data 
coming back from the server

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.413
is for the location you expect.

00:00:26.631 --> 00:00:30.053
Note that there's no validation
on this string input.

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:32.506
If you're trying to make this app
a production app,

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:35.179
you would want some kind 
of error handling here.

00:00:35.813 --> 00:00:38.946
If you tap on pick your units,
it opens up a dialogue

00:00:38.946 --> 00:00:41.782
where you can choose to display
temperature within the app

00:00:41.782 --> 00:00:44.057
as either metric or imperial units.

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:46.603
This is basically just Celsius or Fahrenheit,

00:00:46.603 --> 00:00:48.479
and that is what this settings activity does.

00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:51.320
Remember that you don't want to make
everything a setting.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.415
If you're discussing a feature 
with a teammate

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:55.108
and you can't decide on something,

00:00:55.108 --> 00:00:57.993
don't compromise 
by just making it a user setting.

00:00:57.993 --> 00:01:01.538
There are instances where making 
a difficult product decision now

00:01:01.538 --> 00:01:04.696
will be better for the user, because then
they won't have the burden

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:07.555
of having to decide what the value
of the setting should be.

00:01:07.555 --> 00:01:11.004
And remember, there's always
an opportunity in an app update

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.500
to add the setting later.

00:01:12.512 --> 00:01:14.247
If you add it to begin with,

00:01:14.247 --> 00:01:16.472
it's infinitely harder 
to take away the setting

00:01:16.472 --> 00:01:19.225
because some users 
might get angry with you.

00:01:19.744 --> 00:01:22.821
If you're having trouble deciding 
if something should be a setting or not,

00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:25.990
you can check out the setting section
in the Android design guide,

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.274
which is linked below.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.173
It contains a workflow diagram 
that could help you.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.247
Very few roads often lead 
to making something a setting.
