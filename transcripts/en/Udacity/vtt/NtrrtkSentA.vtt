Thanks Veto. 
And now it's time

00:00:01.984 --> 00:00:04.372
to install the Sunshine app 
on our phones.

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:07.303
So to get started, 
let's grab a USB cable.

00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:12.748
We'll plug in our device and then 
we'll need to enable USB debugging.

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.986
This can be found in Developer options
in the Settings app.

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:20.066
But note that on Android 
devices 4.2 and above,

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.184
the option is actually hidden by default.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.897
To find the secret menu,
go to the Settings app.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:31.988
Scroll down to About Phone.

00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:34.816
Then go down to Build Number

00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:36.613
and tap on that seven times.

00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:43.071
Then, when you go back to Settings,

00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.707
you'll see the Developer 
options menu appear.

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:49.279
Also, set up your computer 
to detect your device.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:52.041
Check the instructor notes 
for more details.

00:00:52.232 --> 00:00:54.515
We're going to continue 
using a device because it's faster

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:58.345
and smoother for development. 
But if you don't have one, that's okay.

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.561
You can continue using the emulator 
that we created previously.
