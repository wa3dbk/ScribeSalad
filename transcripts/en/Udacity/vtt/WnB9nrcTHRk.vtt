00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.270
So now let's try to apply the concept
that we have learned to an actual cache.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.660
We know that the main memory
in a computer is large and

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.880
very slow to access compared
to processor speed.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.490
And also we know that there
is lots of spatial and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.950
temporal locality present
in our data accesses.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.620
Most programs exhibit a lot of
spatial and temporal locality.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.300
So for an access to a memory location
what do you think we should do?

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.030
Should we go to the main memory for
every access?

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.920
Should we have a small memory inside the
processor core, and then we bring stuff

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.770
we access there so that next time
we need it, we can find it quickly?

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.990
Or should we have a huge memory
next to our processor chip,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.530
because it won't fit
on the processor chip?

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.400
And then,
as we read from the main memory,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.530
we bring everything into this
memory that is next to us.
