00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.780
The missing side length is 27 units. Great work if you found that number.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.135
Again, we'll start with the right triangle and this time we'll have one side of

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:15.558
36 and a hypotenuse of 45. Remember the hypotenuse needs to be right directly

00:00:15.558 --> 00:00:21.220
across from the 90 degree angle. This means that this missing side link must be

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.794
x. We'll square the legs and sum those together to get the square of the

00:00:25.794 --> 00:00:34.188
hypotenuse. So we'll have x squared plus 1,296 equals 2,025. We'll subtract

00:00:34.188 --> 00:00:40.338
1,296 from both sides of the equation to get x squared equals 729. Now we can

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:45.279
take the square root of both sides, keeping only the positive root, so x is

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:50.608
equal to 27. The other way to solve this problem is to use the special triangle

00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:56.640
3, 4, 5. If we were to multiply each of these numbers by 9, we would get 36 and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.433
we would get 45. This must mean that 9 has to be the multiplier for each of the

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:08.560
side lengths. So to find this missing piece, we simply multiply 3 by 9 to get

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.581
27. Again, this is why it's helpful sometimes to know the pythagorean triples.

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.950
If you know a couple of them it might make your problem solving easier.
