00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There was only one correct answer, which is this one over here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The inadmissibility of the heuristic might lead down an exploration of the state space

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that leads to the goal on a suboptimal path.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let me demonstrate this to you.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here is a world. Suppose our start step is here. Our goal is here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The heuristic is super large for those states over here

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and smaller around here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The nodes will be expanded following the zeros around here and around here,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the first time the goal is set occurs when we reach the point over here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We never discover the shortcut straight from S to G

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because of the inadmissible heuristic.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That renders point 2 correct, and as a result

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
A-star will not always find the optimal path as I have just proven.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, it turns out A-star will find the path if one exists.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It might find a suboptimal path, but eventually it expands

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
all the nodes that can be reached.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If the goal state is among them, it'll succeed to find a path.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Therefore this answer here was wrong.

00:01:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Of course, none of the above is also a false answer.
