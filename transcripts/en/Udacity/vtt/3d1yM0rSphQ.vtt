00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
What both Alice and Bob have so far been able to find is--they have found

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.070
exponential time algorithms for their problem and they haven't been able

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.860
to come up with anything better so far.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.460
The question of course is does the fact that Alice and Bob have not yet been able to come up

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.100
with a polynomial time algorithm mean that the problems they are working on are only solvable

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.290
in exponential time or could there be some sort of polynomial time algorithm

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.080
that they haven't found yet and there's a special terminology for that.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.600
Problems or computer problems where you only have exponential time algorithms

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.050
are called intractable problems, and those compute problems where you can't find

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.590
a polynomial time algorithm--those are called tractable problems.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.530
And this is going to be a rather obvious question to some of you I hope--

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.890
does the fact that so far we only know exponential time algorithms for the problem that

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.920
Alice was working on and the problem that Bob was working on.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.190
Does that mean that their problems are intractable or in other words, can we already say

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:18.290
whether Alice's or Bob's problems are intractable or tractable, and I would like you to tell me

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.580
if you think that is the case, so if we can already say that their problems are intractable

00:01:23.580 --> 99:59:59.000
or if there's probably more information that we need.
