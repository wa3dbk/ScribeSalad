00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.900
So let's look at our first function, f of x equals 2x plus 3. The domain is all

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.974
real numbers, as is the range. And, this function is neither even nor odd.

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:17.661
Let's look at our second function, f of x equals x squared plus 6. Our domain

00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:22.395
is again all real numbers. Our range is y greater than or equal to 6. And this

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:28.277
is an even function. let's look at f of x equals negative 2. Our domain is again

00:00:28.277 --> 00:00:34.557
all real numbers, but our range is restricted to y is equal to negative 2. And

00:00:34.557 --> 00:00:40.138
this is an even function. let's look at f of x equals x cubed minus 1. The

00:00:40.138 --> 00:00:46.100
domain is all real numbers, as is the range, and this is neither even nor odd.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.554
Let's look at the function f of x equals the absolute value of x minus 2. The

00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:57.369
domain is all real numbers. The range is y is greater than or equal to 0. And

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.393
this is neither even nor an odd function. Our last function, f of x equals the

00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:10.230
square root of 3 x plus 2. Our domain is x is greater than or equal to 2 3rds.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.433
Our range, y greater than or equal to 0. And again, this is neither even nor an

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:18.424
odd function.
