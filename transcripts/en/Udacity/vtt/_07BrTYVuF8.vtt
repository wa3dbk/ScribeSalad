00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.250
What kind of data model could
be used to populate this table?

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.910
The view in each row shows the same
three things, the album name,

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.230
an image from the album,
and the picture count.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.950
Then those rows are repeated.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.440
So, this table could be a representation
of some ordered list of similar items,

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.500
for example, an array.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.390
Which of the following models might
be used to construct this table?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.667
An array of structs?

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.051
An array of dictionaries?
