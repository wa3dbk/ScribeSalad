00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.258
We've seen things like x squared minus 16 several times before. This is just

00:00:04.258 --> 00:00:08.717
taking the difference between two squared numbers. And in cases like that, our

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:13.001
two factors are almost the same, except the signs, between the two terms are

00:00:13.001 --> 00:00:16.579
switched. So we have x minus 4 times x plus 4 is greater than 0.
