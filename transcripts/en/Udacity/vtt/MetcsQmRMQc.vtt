00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.915
This first one is true. The greater the variability of each individual sample,

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:10.500
the less likely a population means will differ significantly. That's less

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.218
likely than this case. And similarly, the smaller the variability of each

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:20.726
individual sample, the more likely they will differ significantly. The

00:00:20.726 --> 00:00:26.255
variability of individual samples is called Within group variability.
