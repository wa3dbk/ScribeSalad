Here's my version. I'm using the string module as well

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.720
which has this handy little thing called string.letters which is just

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.380
a bunch of letters. And then I'm using the random.choice

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.490
function which chooses one value from a list and returns that.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:14.650
And then we can join it all together in a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.790
string using join. And we're going to do that five times. Okay,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.380
so if we run my function it looks like this. And

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.290
if we run it again. We get a different result and

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.930
if we run again we're going to get an even different result,

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.670
okay, so this is a cool little function for making our salt.
