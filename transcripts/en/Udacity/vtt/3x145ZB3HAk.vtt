If you got 10 over 21, you got it right. Let's see how to get that answer. Since

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:10.728
these numbers are large, we want to try to factor them before we multiply them,

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:15.983
and see if we can cancel any factors. So, we can write 8 as, 4 times 2 and we

00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:21.344
can write 15 as, 3 times 5. For the second fraction, we can write 25 as 5 times

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:27.185
5. And we can write 28 as 7 times 4. If you notice, there's a 4 in the

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:33.927
numerator, and a 4 in the denominator. So, we know that 4 over 4 equals 1. Also,

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:39.001
there's a 5 in the numerator and a 5 in the denominator and we know that 5 over

00:00:39.013 --> 00:00:43.441
5 is equal to 1. So, after we cancel any factors that are in common between the

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:48.657
numerator and the denominator, we simply multiply the numerators together, so

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:53.352
we're left with 2 times 5 and we multiply the denominators together, 3 times 7.

00:00:53.628 --> 00:00:59.176
So we know, 2 times 5 is 10, and we know that 3 times 7 is 21.
