00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.984
This was the number of cells we found from our last problem. Let's think about

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:08.048
how big this number is. What digit or digits do you think are the most important

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.978
in this number? Is it the 1, the 6, the middle 7, the 2, or the last 6? Check

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.987
the numbers that you think are right. And this is debatable, so don't worry if

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.004
you don't get it right on your first try.
