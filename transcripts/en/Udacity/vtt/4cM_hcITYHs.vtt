00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.314
In the latest version of our suburban scene, we had a moving car and a moving

00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:09.114
dog. But of course really we want all the dogs and cars to move. One way of

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:13.567
doing that would be, instead of just making one car and dog move, to put all

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:20.010
the cars and dogs into an array list of movable objects. But you might say we

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.777
already have an array list of drawables, can't we reuse that? We can, but we

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:29.358
have to learn a bit more about working with types and Java. Let's say I have a

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:35.204
drawable, what I'd like to know is if it's a movable. The instanceof test gives

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:40.336
me the answer to that. This expression is true, if d happens to belong to a

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:46.808
class that also implements the moveable interface. Of course in that case, I'd

00:00:46.808 --> 00:00:51.894
like to then call the move method. But not so fast, I can't call d.move because

00:00:51.894 --> 00:00:57.802
d is not movable. I have to convert d to something that is movable. Here is how

00:00:57.802 --> 00:01:04.900
you do that in Java. This expression means take d and cast it into a movable.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.059
We've previously seen the cast notation to change a floating point number into

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:14.610
an integer, it's the same notation but now with an interface type. Once it is a

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.634
movable, then it is saved in the variable of type movable. And then we can

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:23.776
invoke the move method on m. Again you couldn't have invoked on d because d

00:01:23.776 --> 00:01:29.500
doesn't have a move method, that's drawable. This conversion is necessary. What

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.440
if you make a cast of something that wasn't movable such as a house then he

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.766
would get an exception and your program would terminate. That's why it's

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:41.004
important that we first check whether d in fact is movable. These instances of

00:01:41.004 --> 00:01:45.688
tests and casts are not very common but they do happen every so often. And it's

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:49.464
good to be familiar with them. So go ahead and put this to work. In the scene

00:01:49.464 --> 00:01:54.590
program, go through all of the drawables. Find out which of them are moveable,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.159
and move them.
