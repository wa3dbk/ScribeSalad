00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've just been talking about getting customers in a physical channel, but what's really interesting is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
most startups kind of forget that it's much more expensive to get a customer than it is to keep one.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yet, we seem to go from order to order or user to user forgetting about thinking about all the time

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is how can we extract more dollars or usage or whatever is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
important to us from our existing customers.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
How we do that is the first thing we need to do is make sure our existing customers we've just gotten

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
don't go away, and so if you're in business long enough,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you'll start thinking about how to keep customers.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Some examples, well the airlines are the perfect examples of keeping customers.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They run something called the loyalty programs.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They give you points, they give you rewards, etc. for staying with their airline.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Credit card companies--boy, they love to keep you using their credit card because you know what

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
it's just a piece of plastic and they're loaning you money--anybody can do that,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
but they want your business full-time, so they'll make up programs and things that make you think

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
about--oh, it will be terrible to leave this credit card with this airline because I loose all the points.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That's a great example of a loyalty program.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Or product updates, here's a way to keep me loyal is instead of just this one-time purchase,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm getting these updates or newsletters or something useful through the lifetime of the product

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and Smart Companies not only do loyalty and product updates, sometimes they send me

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
newsletters and here's what's going on and here's whatever and how can we help you, etc.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Even though on day 1 you're not thinking about keeping customers

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because you're desperately worried about getting them, just understand the next thing

00:01:50.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you're going to be doing is worrying about how to keep your most valuable customer.
