00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.310
To show you why Numpy and
pandas are useful.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.790
I'm going to revisit some
code from last lesson, and

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.400
see how it would look if
I wrote it using pandas.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.980
This is the code to first take a CSV and
read it into a list, and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.420
then get the unique
accounts out of that list.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.920
I'm running this code on
the daily engagement full file,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.080
since that file is rather large, and
pandas deals with large files nicely.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.900
Now if I run the code to load the file
into a CSV, it takes a little while and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.330
finally it finished.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.230
Now, we cut some of the loading
time out of the video, but

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.220
it took about one minute.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.250
Then after that, getting the unique
students takes a little while as well.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.700
In fact, this one is going to take
about six seconds, and now we're done.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.640
As you'll see in a minute,
when I use pandas,

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.580
the code will run much more quickly.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.910
In fact, in pandas this will also
be only three lines of code.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970
The first will be this import statement.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.630
In the second, I'll read it in the file
using pandas built-in read CSV function.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.500
And, finally, I can specify that I
want to look at the acct column.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.470
And then use pandas built-in unique
function to get the unique accounts.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.370
As you can see, pandas has a lot of
convenient functions, like read CSV and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.130
unique, that previously
we had written ourselves.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.530
Now of these three lines of code, the
one that actually takes the longest for

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.560
me is importing pandas, which takes
several seconds the first time I do it.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.780
That is certainly very long for
just importing a library.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.980
But it more than makes up for it with
the speed of the rest of the code.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.930
After that, reading the data into
the CSV takes just a few seconds,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.380
rather than the one minute
that I waited earlier.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.610
And actually getting the unique accounts
finishes before I can even blink.
