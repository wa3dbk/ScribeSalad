HTTPS helps prevent intruders from
tampering with the communication

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.210
between your progressive web app and
your user's browser.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.960
It's also a stricter requirement
to use service workers.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.440
Your app must be served over HTTPS in
order to register a service worker.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.490
And many older APIs that may reveal
sensitive data are being updated

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.090
to require HTTPS, such as the geo
location API and gate user media.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.500
For deploying your weather app,
there are a number of options.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.430
You can add HTTPS to your own server.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.560
There's a great source free
certificates in the instructor notes.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.660
Or you can use one of the hosting
providers that offer HTTPS by default.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.580
GitHub pages and Firebase both
support static hosting over HTTPS.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.860
And the Google Cloud
platform offers app engine.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.400
Which can support HTTPS and is useful
if you need any back end logic.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.280
One thing I really like
about Firebase's hosting

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.310
is that it redirects
all requests to HTTPS.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.033
Even if a user types in HTTP://,

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.900
it will automatically
redirect to the secure url.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.310
let's walk through the steps
to deploy the Firebase.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.570
I've already created my account and
added a new project.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.540
And I've already installed
the Firebase command line tools.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.920
If you haven't worked with Firebase
before, check out the link to

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.890
the hosting docs in the instructor notes
for a quick getting starting guide.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.640
First, I need to authenticate to
the Firebase command line tool

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.010
using Firebase login.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.300
Next I need to initialize my Firebase
app by running Firebase init.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.580
I'll give it the app name
that it should deploy to,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.740
the directory I want it to upload and
so forth.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.590
Finally, I can run Firebase deploy and
it will upload everything to Firebase.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.080
Let's give it a try.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.040
&gt;&gt; If you haven't worked with Firebase
before, check the link to the hosting

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.280
docks and the instructor notes for
a quick getting started guide.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.387
First, I need to authenticate
the Firebase command line

00:02:14.387 --> 00:02:16.050
using Firebase log in.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.730
Great, success.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.790
Next, I need to initialize my
Firebase up by running Firebase init.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.280
I'll give it the name of
the app it should use.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.390
The directory I wanted to upload and
so forth.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.860
Finally, I can run Firebase,
deploy and it'll upload everything.

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.740
Let's give it a try.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.860
Looks perfect.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:37.690
&gt;&gt; Perfect.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.190
Seems like everything
worked exactly as I expect
