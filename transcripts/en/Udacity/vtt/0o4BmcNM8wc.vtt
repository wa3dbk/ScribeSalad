00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I could take the results from all plays, so each play is a triple of position, direction, and a word,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and then I could add a score to those, but it seems like I'm just taking this lists apart

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and putting them back together so many time. I've already done it three times.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I did a row play--took it apart, added it back in j for the horizontal plays, and took that apart,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
added back in a direction for all_plays. I could do that one more time to insert the score.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Maybe that would've been the right choice.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Maybe I just got fatigued, and I made a mistake in my design sense,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but what I decided to do was modify my horizontal_plays and all_plays functions.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There are two modifications.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Here in horizontal_plays, after I got the play, I calculate a score,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then I insert that into my result.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Now my results are no longer just position, word play--they're score, position, word play.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then I want to do the same thing in all_plays.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I want to make my play be a score, position, direction, word tuple,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and I'm just, as before, ripping these things apart and putting them back together.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, remember the board. It's got these double letters, triple word scores, and so on.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If you're old-school it looks like this.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is on a piece of cardboard that's a physical material.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We've also written triple and double scores, so I need to come up with some ways

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
of representing these spots on the board and how they're special.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Now, could I squeeze it into my existing representation of a row?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Remember a row is a list, and it can have things like that border is a string.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Then we have a letter. Then we can have anchors like ANY.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Could I have room for putting information about bonus squares on the board--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the double and triple letters?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Could I have, say, 3W to mean triple-word score as an element of this row?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I guess my intuition is I don't think that's going to work very well.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The problem is one of these squares--say this one--

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
could be both an anchor and a triple-word score.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So we'd need some representation that allowed both of those.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That just doesn't seem to be easy to extend what I already have.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Let's not override our row notation.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Our rows, as we have it--I'm pretty happy with them.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm not going to allow this. I'm going to keep row exactly as they are.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I'm going to introduce another data structure--a parallel board, I'm going to have two boards.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
One board that I play on and another board that holds the bonuses. Think of it as two layers.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
One representation of a two-dimensional matrix just holds these double words

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and triple letters scores and so on,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and then on top of that there's a second two-dimensional array

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that holds the values of the letters and also holds the anchors. Oh, I got a good score.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now I'm going to have board[ j ][ i ] will hold the letter or anchor,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and then bonus[ j ][ i ] will hold corresponding bonus--

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a double word, a triple letter, or just nothing.
