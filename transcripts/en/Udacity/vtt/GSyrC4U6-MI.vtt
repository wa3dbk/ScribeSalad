Here's the flashlight effect. It's pretty simple to code. We'll look at that in

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.190
a second. However, the effect is not very convincing, as the flashlight cannot

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.454
currently move around. This is the only addition I made to the fragment shader.

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:15.870
The vViewPosition is the location of surface in view space. Actually, this is

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.440
the position negated, but for our purposes, it doesn't matter too much. Since

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.270
view space is looking down the negative z axis, and x and y are zero at the

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.500
center of the screen, the flashlight always shines at the middle. We can return

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.450
early if the surface is outside the given flashlight radius, so that only the

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.910
ambient contribution lights the object. I've added the uniform uFlashOffset, a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.645
two element vector that gives the center point for the flashlight. There are

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:42.280
sliders hooked up to it, but the vector is not used in the fragment shader

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.020
itself. That's your task. If the X, Y view position in this location are close

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.030
enough together, the flashlight should illuminate the surface. Your job is to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.690
change this code. When you're done, your slider should move the flashlight

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.800
around. Look in the original course materials for GLSL documentation links. You

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.484
can solve this problem with a one line change by using the proper GLSL built-in

00:01:03.484 --> 00:01:04.044
function.
