00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, here's my answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It centers around this SQL statement.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Select * from links where submitter_id = 62443

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and votes &gt; 1000.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Those are the constraints of the question.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I make a link just as we've done previously.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I use the fetchone function, and then I return that first link's ID.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let's give this a run, and we see that the answer is 15,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which is the correct answer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, if you didn't remember that submitter_id is the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is the column name for the user's ID,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
you could have found it in a couple of places.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
One, you could have looked at the SQL here for creating the table,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and you can see it's called submitter_id.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Or you could have gone up here to the definition of the link class

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and guessed that I would have used the same property.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But that's the answer.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay, let's get a little fancier with our SQL here.
