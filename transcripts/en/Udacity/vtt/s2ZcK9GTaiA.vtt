To conclude this lesson, I'm going to have a

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.650
simple quiz and what I'm going to ask you

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.950
is, which kind of mistake adding people to a late project is? And you can pick

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.540
between a people mistake, a product mistake, a

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.830
technology mistake, or maybe this is not a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.800
mistake at all, it is actually okay to add people to a project that is late.
