00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.003
Now, there's just one little blemish to the program that we've just written. It

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:11.077
uses what programmers refer to as magic numbers. Look at this line over here,

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:17.204
and it begs to question why 25, why 255? Those look like values that a magician

00:00:17.204 --> 00:00:21.665
picked out of a hat. Instead of using magic numbers, it's a good idea to use

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:27.098
constants. Here is how you do this in Java. The keyword, final, indicates a

00:00:27.098 --> 00:00:33.374
number that can never be changed that has assumed it's final value. Or like we

00:00:33.374 --> 00:00:37.200
would say in math, it's a constant value. So here, are the 25, I'll call it

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.212
added red and the 255 here, called max red. I defined these as variables just

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:45.811
like you would define any other variable, except for the keyword final in

00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:50.792
front. And also, it's a convention amongst Java programmers, that constants

00:00:50.792 --> 00:00:56.030
should be written in upper case. Maybe with an occasional underscore. Now, go

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.320
ahead and rewrite the statement here, using these two constants instead of the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.289
magic numbers. And put your answers into this box.
