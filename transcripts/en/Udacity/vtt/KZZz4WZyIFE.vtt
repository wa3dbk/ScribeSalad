00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.139
When we talked about rational numbers, we
said that they are numbers that can be

00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:09.970
written as ratios of integers. Irrational
numbers are numbers that are not rational,

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.455
so they are numbers that can't be written
as ratios of integers. We've seen that

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:21.177
rational numbers are either integers or
have decimals that either end or repeat.

00:00:21.177 --> 00:00:26.265
Irrational numbers, therefore, have
infinitely long decimals that don't follow

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:30.831
any sort of pattern. Perhaps the most
common way that we run into irrational

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:35.264
numbers is through taking square roots of
numbers that are not perfect squares, just

00:00:35.276 --> 00:00:40.600
like we tried to do with the slide
example. There are some other numbers that

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.535
have special roles in math and physics
that are also irrational, like the number

00:00:45.535 --> 00:00:57.402
E, which is about equal to
2.71828182845... or pi. Please remember

00:00:57.402 --> 00:01:00.647
that I have just rounded off these
decimals because I don't want to write any

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.510
more numbers, but like all the other
irrational numbers, pi and e have

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.083
infinitely many numbers in the decimals
and they do not repeat. So now we've

00:01:11.083 --> 00:01:15.272
developed a whole world of numbers that
fit most things that we need to count,

00:01:15.272 --> 00:01:20.226
measure, and calculate in every day life.
There are still more types of numbers that

00:01:20.226 --> 00:01:25.911
we haven't touched on yet. Let's look at
the whole entire world of numbers just for

00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:32.429
a second. Let's start with the natural
numbers, such as 3 and 718. We then went

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.644
from the natural numbers to the whole
numbers by adding 0 to that set. And on to

00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:44.647
the set of integers by adding the negative
whole numbers. From the integers we get to

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:52.631
rational numbers by creating ratios of
integers with a non-0 denominator. Those

00:01:52.662 --> 00:01:57.865
numbers which are not rational are known as
irrational numbers, such as e and pi. They

00:01:57.865 --> 00:02:04.265
have infinitely long, non repeating
decimals. Finally, we get to real numbers,

00:02:04.265 --> 00:02:09.354
which include the rational and irrational
numbers we have discussed this far.
