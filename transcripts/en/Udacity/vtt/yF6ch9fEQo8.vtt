[Evans] The answer is Alice needs to send the value of hashing s 98 times.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The hash chain is going backwards.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We can only verify hashes in 1 direction.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The hash is hard to compute in 1 direction.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's the valuable property the hash function gives us.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so we have to go backwards if we want to use it for authentication.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here we're using it to authenticate Alice.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If someone just knows x, if someone intercepts p, knows the previous password value,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
they could compute any of these other values.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Those are easy to compute once you have p.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
This was p, this one is just computing the hash of p,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and this one is computing the hash of the hash of p.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The only one that would be hard to compute is this one.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The server can check that that's correct using the same process.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
At this point, the value of x is hash 99 of s.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So when the value of p that's sent is hash to the 98th power of s,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
doing hash 98 times, then this equation will be true only if the value sent was correct.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So what I've described is what's known as the S/Key password system.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The way S/Key would work, the server would generate the hash chain.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's say there are 100 entries.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Alice would print these out in a list,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and they would be turned into strings that are easier to type than pure bit sequences.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The server would store the last entry in that hash chain and nothing else.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so what's stored in the server could not be used to log in.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The list that Alice has could be used, and I should correct this

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that if Alice starts with H 100 as the first thing in her list,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
what the server should actually store would be H 101.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
This has a pretty big downside--that it requires Alice to carry around with her

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
a list of passwords, and instead of remembering something

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that becomes easier and easier to type, she'd have to look at that list,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
type the password correctly, cross that one off, and use the next one next time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And at some point she's going to run out.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
She's going to need to get on a secure connection again to generate a new hash chain

00:01:55.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to be able to keep doing this.
