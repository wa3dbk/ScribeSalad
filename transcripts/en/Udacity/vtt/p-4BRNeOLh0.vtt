00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:04.877
The second one is correct the only difference between the two choices is that 0

00:00:04.877 --> 00:00:09.643
is not included in the first interval and is included in the second one. If we

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:14.363
plug 0 in for x we get g of 0 equals to square root of 0 which is just 0, so the

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:18.950
point zero, zero is included on our graph which we can see right here.
