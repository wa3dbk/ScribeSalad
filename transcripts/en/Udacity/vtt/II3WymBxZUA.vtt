00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.610
Couple of things I want all of you to start playing around with if you can, and

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.090
it would be great for you to start doing this on your own if you

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.080
have the old Python-OpenCV installation.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.720
And again, we will be providing a browser-based way of doing some of this stuff,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.680
the simpler stuff.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.840
So, you can actually try to do testing of loading images and

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.030
stuff like that on your own, within a browser.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.610
But again, we do encourage you to set up a whole platform for

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.635
yourselves on your computers so you can start doing some of this on your own.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.730
I would encourage you to play around with these types of things on your own.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.190
On Python basically, or

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:36.200
OpenCV you can import the OpenCV framework by just typing in import cv2.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.930
And you can read input images of any form and also write them out.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.709
And play around and

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.590
again, as I said, different aspects of doing these types of things.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.600
In Matlab the same thing is possible.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.750
On what you can basically just read images and you can also write them out.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.930
There are other functions you can play around in Matlab including, for

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.320
example, showing the images.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.710
But I encourage you again, to play around and get used to this.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.310
I'm not talking about processing in this lesson here.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.370
But again, there is a lot of documentation available for processing online.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.960
Just a couple other pointers here, you can actually start looking at

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.660
the sizes of images, color channels, bits per pixel information.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.560
Again, both in Matlab and in OpenCV Python, there are ways of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.840
being able to do this and seeing what kind of details you can come up with.
