00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.310
In the previous lesson, we studied
an operating system scheduler adaptation

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.740
for providing accurate timing for
upper layers of software,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.700
especially needed for
real time multi-media applications.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.930
Now we move up in the food chain.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
The focus in this lesson is
in the middleware that sits

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.210
in between commodity
operating systems and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.280
novel multimedia applications that
are realtime and distributed.
