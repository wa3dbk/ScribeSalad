00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.200
Here you can see, we're back at the data binding function, for

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.290
when we added circles to our map.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.520
All this time when we were binding data, you might have been wondering to

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.680
yourself, how does D3 know which data's on the screen, and which data's changed?

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.840
Well, since we're going to be animating and updating our map, we want to be

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.020
very explicit about what each piece of data bound actually represents.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.040
Here we'll be adding a special function, as the second argument to data bind.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.250
It has the familiar syntax of any other accessor function in d3,

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.950
and based on what we return from the function,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.560
d3 binds that value, to the elements selected above.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.216
In this case, our nested grouping actually did a lot of the hard work for us.

00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:53.640
Remember, the key to our nested groups represents the year of the World Cup.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.010
In this case, in our key function, all we need to do is simply return d

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.065
key of the passed in nested object.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:09.110
In this case, d key is going to represent a string corresponding to

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.020
the year of the World Cup, that the given data point d, represents.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:20.590
If we do not specify a key function, D3 uses the datum's index in its array.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.320
And while this works for most static use cases, where you're not

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.530
changing your data array, since we'll be filtering and manipulating our data,

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.850
we don't want to have to rely on that being in the same order every single time.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.280
I also wanted to point out that the nested key

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.880
is not associated in any way to the key function itself.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.670
To use a key function in a data bind, we

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.290
don't actually have to use a nested object, or any object that has a key field.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.780
We can simply return any arbitrary value, or

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.850
any value that depends on our data point.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.030
We could have just as easily, instead of binding our data by year,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.290
bounded by attendance value.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.880
In this case, just to make a point, we're grabbing the attendance value of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.390
a given year, and the value's object, it gets attached to every nested object.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.820
So remember, the key function is much more

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.990
flexible than the key property attached to a d3 object.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.990
And now that we've properly associated a given data row with an object on our

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.230
screen, in this case circles, by some unique key,

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.830
we can begin removing and adding circles as we cycle through our years.
