00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.390
So, the next thing I'm showing
on the slide are two of

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.260
the refinements that are being used
in this assembly specification.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.540
Refinements are little
program generators.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.457
They take existing programs of
some type that implements some

00:00:16.457 --> 00:00:18.830
predetermined interfaces.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.703
And, they compose those programs to
generate a new program, or new variant,

00:00:22.703 --> 00:00:25.020
that implements some other interface.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.050
So, for example, we have here
a refinement called Incor for

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.230
incremental forecaster.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.420
And, Incor is parametrized by two
different kinds of arguments,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.590
one is some component that
implements forecast interface.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.620
The other is some component that
implements the Multipliers interface.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.040
And, when I apply this refinement to
components of those suitable types, then

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.990
I'll actually generate a new component
that implements the forecast interface.

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.950
Likewise, for the FCST refinement,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.440
it's parameterized by two components
that implement the forecast interface,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.200
and it generates a new component
that implements forecast interface.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.510
&gt;&gt; So,
I'd like to relate this term as well.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.230
Earlier In this class, we've talked
about using refinement to go from

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.490
an abstract description of something
to a more concrete description.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.770
It sounds like your refinements here are
doing that with some kind of generator.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.160
&gt;&gt; Exactly, yeah so, but it's meant to
appeal to that same sensibility, right?

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.054
You can think of an interface as
representing an abstract program that

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:27.380
fills in some details.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.750
In particular, in our case, the
signatures of the different tables that

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.515
are going to maintain calculations
that we want to make, like forecasts.

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:39.160
But,hey may be implemented in many,
many, many different ways.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.020
And so, each refinement Is a generator

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.140
that will generate a different way
of implementing that interface.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.600
It really is meant to
appeal the same idea.
