00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.770
Next we're going to apply similar edits
to the code that animates the views

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.340
alpha to one.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.800
First, go into the ViewController.swift
file and copy this fade in code.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700
Next, go back to
the UIViewExtensions file and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.740
paste that code into
the fade in function.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.640
Now, just like before we'll replace
imageview.alpha with self.alpha.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.390
Whatever view is calling this
method is represented by self.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.180
And that is the object
we want to fade in.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.040
The next step is the same as well.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.750
We need to pass in the parameters for
duration, delay, and completion.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.830
And then we pass each of those three
parameters to the animate with

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.750
duration method.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.290
Last but not least,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.550
we need to alter the code in our
view controller to make it simpler.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.620
Now that we have access to the fade out
and fade in methods from this extension.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.800
So go back to
the viewcontroller.swift file.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.410
And we're going to delete this
call to animate with duration.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.140
Everything up to the completion block.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.590
Let's keep that.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.910
Instead of calling
animate with duration,

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.805
we're just going to call fade out.

00:01:04.805 --> 00:01:07.170
We'll call it on
the property image view.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.880
The fade out method takes
in three parameters.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.950
Duration, let's do one second for that.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.300
Delay, we don't want to delay,
so we'll put zero seconds.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.290
And then the mysterious
completion closure,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.820
which we kept there from last time.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.780
The first part of the completion
closure can stay in its original form.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.790
But after the image is swapped,
we want to use the method fade in.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.680
Like we did above with fade out, we'll
delete this animateWithDuration code.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.250
Just go ahead and
delete the whole thing.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.100
And in its place we'll put
a call to self.imageView.fadeIn.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.810
Again we'll put a duration
of one second with no delay.

00:01:46.973 --> 00:01:50.519
Before we put in the completion
parameter, let's pause for a second and

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:54.910
look at the method signature that
Xcode's code completion brings up.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.550
See how the type of this completion
has a question mark at the end?

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.670
This closure has an optional type,
and it's a good thing,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.870
too, because in this case,
we don't actually want anything in

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.130
particular to happen when
the fade in method is finished.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.710
We want to be able to pass in null.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.410
And it's fine for

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.270
the completion closure to be null,
because it's an optional type.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.020
We want to test this out.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.393
But first we should check in our
storyboard file to make sure that all of

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:21.776
our outlets are connected.

00:02:21.776 --> 00:02:26.351
So let's take a look at the image view,
that one's connected.

00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.089
Let's take a look at the button.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.440
That one's connected.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.710
We should be good to go.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.350
The moment of truth.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.640
We'll go up here to Run.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.940
Press the play button.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.420
Here's our image in the simulator.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.140
And then when we press next.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.540
The image fades out,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.050
and when it fades back in it's
change from sunrise to sunset.
