00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.030
Games usually have
a lot of image assets.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.059
Not always.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.770
Some games create quite a bit
of their imagery programatically

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.280
actually using simple
graphics primitives.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.650
But it's definitely more
common to represent actors and

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.900
objects with sprite images or 3D models,
depending on the type of game.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.260
When you add textures, backgrounds,
icons, badges, buttons, and

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.770
other UI elements.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.320
The list of image resources you have to
keep track of just keeps getting longer

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.240
and longer, especially when you may
need multiple copies of an image

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.600
with a different level of detail for
each.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.500
In these cases, it becomes more
efficient to combine related images into

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.300
a single sprite sheet or texture atlas.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.190
There's a little more overhead in the
drawing code but loading becomes much

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
faster, much simpler and
typically you even save storage space

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.970
because the combined images compress
better than they do individually.
