The only value of x that makes this equation true is x equals 3. Great work for

00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:09.992
getting that one correct. First we want to get each radical on one side of the

00:00:09.992 --> 00:00:15.317
equal sign. So we can add this radical to both sides of the equation. Now that

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:18.916
each radical is on either side of the equal sign we can square both sides to

00:00:18.916 --> 00:00:25.183
undo these square roots. So on the left, we'll just be left with the radicand,

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:30.490
6x minus 7. And on the right, we'll be left with this expression, 2x plus 5.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.814
Next, we just want to solve this linear equation for the value of x. So we

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:39.996
subtract 2x from both sides and then, add positive 7 to both sides. This will

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:43.778
leave us with 4x equals 12 and then, we divide both sides by 4 to get x equals

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:48.140
3. To double-check our result, we'll plug in x equals 3 into the original

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.986
equation. When we check x equals 3, we'll get this expression on the left,

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:58.868
which evaluates to root 11 minus root 11, which equals 0. Our answer checks so

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:03.833
we can use this as our solution set, x just equals positive 3.
