00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.969
To create our histogram of user ages, let's start by using

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:06.273
the Q plot function. We'll pass it the variable age. And our

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:10.011
data set is pseudo Facebook so PF. And I'm going to add

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:13.749
some color using the color and fill parameters. Running this code we

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.733
see we get our histogram. Now you might have tried a variety

00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.426
of bin widths. And in this case I think a bin width

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:22.620
of one is the best. So let's add that in here. I

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.280
chose a bin width of one since, one makes sense, since we're

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.370
going by years or ages. This gives me a histogram of

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.340
counts of users by individual years, so I can get a

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.010
finer view of the data for say, like, 25 years old.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.510
By setting the bin width equal to one, it allows us

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.030
to more easily spot unusual spikes in our data. Points like

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.380
here, here, and definitely out here. Let's zoom in on this

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.280
plot and take a closer look. I see the largest spikes

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.300
in the mid to late 20's. And we don't have any users

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.290
who put in an age lower than 13 at the left

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.570
of the histogram. This makes sense because users must be at least

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.680
13 years old to set up a Facebook account. Now there's also

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.830
some unusual spikes above 100, but my guess is that some users

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.640
may be exaggerating their age. Do you have any friends who that

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.190
are 100 years or older on Facebook? I know I certainly don't.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.000
And one final comment that I want to make is that your x-axis

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.550
might look slightly different than mine. Remember that we can use scale

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.258
x discrete or scale x continuous to change this appearance.

00:01:19.258 --> 00:01:21.725
So I adding scale x discrete here, I can set the

00:01:21.725 --> 00:01:25.070
breaks so they run from 0 to 113, and they

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.340
increment every five units, or every five years. Now you might

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.300
be wondering why I chose 113 here, and I have

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.990
a simple answer for you. I just used the maximum age

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.460
in our user data set. Remember I can find that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.570
out by running Summary on that variable. So I can see

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.621
the minimum age is 13, and the maximum age is 113.
