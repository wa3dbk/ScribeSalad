00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.630
Let's talk a bit about
the Icicles project architecture.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.870
By which I mean the classes
that will make up Icicles.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.770
First, we have IciclesGame,

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.110
which is our application listener,
the entry point into our code.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.980
IciclesGame will delegate its
application listener callbacks to one of

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.650
two screens.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.330
DifficultyScreen,, which allows the user
to select the difficulty of a game.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.815
And IcicleScreen,
which contains the actual gameplay.

00:00:26.815 --> 00:00:31.370
IciclesScreen uses two other classes
to hold the state of the game world.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.710
There's Player, which handles the
position of the little stick figure down

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.330
at the bottom of the screen and
also manages user input.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.670
And then, there's Icicles, which manages
the position of all the icicles.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.280
Icicles itself, is basically, a
collection of a bunch of icicle objects.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.110
Finally, we'll be very careful to keep
all constants in their own class.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.940
There's two reasons for this.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.420
The first is that when constants
are spread all over the place,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.920
it becomes incredibly frustrating to
find the number that you want to tweak.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.460
If you want to change, for instance, how
fast the icicles drop, you might need to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.730
drill down into IciclesGame, and
then go find an IciclesScreen, and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.760
maybe it's in Icicles,
maybe it's in the Icicle singular class.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.290
Who knows where it is?

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.840
We'll just keep all of those
constants in their own class.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.330
Even more important, is the fact that
when you develop games in a professional

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.250
context, you're often building
a platform that allows artists and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.290
designers to easily
slot in their content.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.240
You need to design your game in such
a way that your game designer can

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.290
add a new weapon, or
change some balance easily.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.990
Or your artist can swap out some art
assets, all without needing your help.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.210
Rigorously using a constants class
is a baby step in this direction.
