The answer is the Brewery.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.939
Looking at the map, you'll notice that Edward Street and

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.480
Portland Street have a couple deaths along them.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.710
The Workhouse shows exactly five deaths over here,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.460
but the Brewery has no deaths along its borders.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.030
So what is exactly so special about the Brewery?

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.370
Why would no one have succumbed to cholera there?
