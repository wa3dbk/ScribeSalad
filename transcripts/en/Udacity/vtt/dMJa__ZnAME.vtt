00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.750
Hello. You may not know this from looking at me, but I am plagued with an

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.225
unfortunate circumstance. You see, I'm nearsighted, which means the lenses in

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:13.525
my eyes are a little, shall we say, overzealous, and they bend light just

00:00:13.525 --> 00:00:18.864
slightly too much. Since the light does not bend around my retina, my world is

00:00:18.864 --> 00:00:24.130
a blur. But of course, with every problem, there is a solution. By placing a

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.140
diverging lens in front of my eyes, I could fix my faulty vision. And to think

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.491
for years I was condemned to wearing glasses. Me. In glasses.

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:37.814
[LAUGH]

00:00:37.814 --> 00:00:44.818
How passe! How cliche, I thought. I was as appalled then as I'm sure you are

00:00:44.818 --> 00:00:50.294
now, but, I did find a solution with Odin's eye monocles. With Odin's eye

00:00:50.294 --> 00:00:56.065
monocles, I can fix my vision with style, one eye at a time. It works with

00:00:56.065 --> 00:01:00.493
farsighted people, too. So, if I have trouble reading as I age, I can simply

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:05.980
buy a converging lens to fix that problem as well. But, I know what you might

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.567
be saying. What about your depth perception? How can you gauge distance if you

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:14.908
only have one eye working at a time? Well, I laugh at your childish notion of

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.492
binocular depth perception, for I have discovered that monocular cues have

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:23.146
served me just fine. By looking at the relative size of objects or taken

00:01:23.146 --> 00:01:27.540
advantage of linear perspective or interposition. I have been able to gauge

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.499
distance quite well. Quite well, indeed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SOUND]

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:34.020
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Odin's eye. It worked for me. Will you let it work, for you?
