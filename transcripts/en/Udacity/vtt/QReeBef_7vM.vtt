00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.450
The operator I've used here, simply a single plus prepended to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.820
the attendance field, is what's called the unary operator.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.310
It's a little JavaScript trick to convert a string into an integer.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.290
I'm sure if you've used JavaScript or other programming languages,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:25.440
you've used the unary plus operator's sister, the unary negation operator.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.730
In this case, a single minus sign.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.240
In this case, with a single minus sign, we're simply negating the value.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.650
Which usually makes pretty intuitive sense.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.740
The unary plus, on the other hand, looks a little bit more strange.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.030
Again, whatever you put it in front of, it tries to convert into a numeric form.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.120
In this case, since attendance is an integer, it will convert it

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.450
into an integer and then update the value of the attendance column.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.180
If we try to use the unary plus or

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.420
the unary negative on something like a string that doesn't have

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.700
a natural numeric representation, we'll simply get not a number back.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.210
And if you're curious, I encourage you to experiment in a web browser console or

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.370
other JavaScript environment
