00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.175
Hello, yellow, and peach all pass now. If I go to the code, and when the letter

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:11.548
is not a vowel, I change insideVowelGroup to false. Now if I make sure my

00:00:11.548 --> 00:00:16.293
program is not still running, and then compile, and run it again, it seems like

00:00:16.293 --> 00:00:22.390
it's counting all of the syllables correctly for these words.
