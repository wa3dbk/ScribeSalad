00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.230
High quality lenses can be used to improve clarity for

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.840
the eye or for a camera, the brain cannot influence

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.540
this area. Too much light can temporarily or permanently blind

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.400
eyes but will also blind a typical camera as the

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.710
image produced will be overexposed often appearing all white. It's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.300
the eye that's damaged, not the brain's interpretation of what

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.310
the eye is seeing. Muscles in the eye control the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.150
eye's focus but the brain does not interpret the image differently.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.470
The answer is that we see images right side up.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.330
Look at our pinhole camera model. The image is actually formed

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.030
upside down. The simple idea that the image on a retina

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.390
goes directly into our brain in that form is clearly false.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600
There is in fact a considerable amount of processing that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
occurs in the brain beyond just rotating the image 180 degrees.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.210
For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.580
is attached. Our brains fill in this area with the surrounding

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.590
elements in the scene.
