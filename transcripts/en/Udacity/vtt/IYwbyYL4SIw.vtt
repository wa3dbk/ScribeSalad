00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.910
Now that we've worked with expressions for a while, let's move on to some

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:09.151
equations. Please solve for x in the following equation. 3x squared plus 18

00:00:09.151 --> 00:00:13.425
equals 0. Although there are a couple of different methods you could use for

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.457
solving this, I'd like you to try to do it without using the quadratic formula

00:00:17.457 --> 00:00:22.953
this time. Please write the solutions in as concise a form as you can.
