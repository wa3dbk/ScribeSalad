00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.323
Now that we've seen adding and subtracting radicals, I want you to try these

00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:07.540
four problems out. Keep in mind that we can only combine radicals that are

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.230
alike. They need to have the same index and they need to have the same radical.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.758
When you think you know answers, put them on the boxes and if something can't

00:00:15.758 --> 00:00:20.885
be simplified, simply write in that expression as it is. Think carefully about

00:00:20.885 --> 00:00:22.653
each of these and good luck.
