Data is the most essential part of statistics. Without data we couldn't do

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.926
anything. So now we have data on how many hours you slept, your recognition

00:00:09.938 --> 00:00:14.988
score and your temporal memory score, and we have data values for each one of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.570
you who entered these scores. So the first person slept 7 hours, got a 91%

00:00:20.582 --> 00:00:26.922
recognition score and an 86% temporal memory score. So this row of data is for

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:33.112
one person. The next person got 6.5 hours of sleep, a 95% recognition score and

00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:38.708
a 78 percent temporal memory score. And remember, that you can see this actual

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.366
data if you click on the BBC results link. Anyway, so we have columns of data,

00:00:44.487 --> 00:00:50.226
and each row corresponds to one person. Hours slept, recognition score, and

00:00:50.238 --> 00:00:55.457
temporal memory score are called variables, because they vary across

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.703
individuals. So now we're returning to the question. You have an exam tomorrow.

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:04.378
Should you get a good night's sleep tonight? Does it matter?
