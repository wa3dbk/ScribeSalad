00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.110
So the idea of Potential-based Shaping
is going to be this.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.090
Instead of giving little bonuses for
good things happening,

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.320
what we're actually going to do is
put bonuses on states of the world.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.927
Then when you achieve a certain state
of the world you get that bonus.

00:00:13.927 --> 00:00:16.390
And if you unachieve that state
of the world you lose that bonus.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.977
So everything kind of
balances out nicely.

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:21.620
So we'll write down an equation for
that in a moment but

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.066
let's see if we can think about what
state based rewards might look like

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:28.358
in the context of this little soccer
example we were talking about.

00:00:28.358 --> 00:00:29.372
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:34.153
&gt;&gt; So the official reward function has
us getting a +100 for scoring a goal but

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:35.680
we wanted to give hints.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.880
We wanted to give hints
to the system for

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.120
getting near the ball, hitting the ball,
getting the ball near the goal.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.970
So we need to do that,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.230
we need to define that now in
terms of the states of the world.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.910
So what would be some appropriate
rewards that we could put in for that?

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.600
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, I think they would be
very similar to the ones that we were

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.270
talking about before, right?

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.459
If you're talking about states, you want
to be in the state of the ball moving

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:05.230
towards the goal, or
the ball being near the goal,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.820
or you moving towards the ball,
or kicking the ball.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.105
Those are all states you
would like to be in, right?

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:11.455
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:15.862
All right, so yeah, and the way
that we were writing that before,

00:01:15.862 --> 00:01:21.530
I think, was something like 1 over
the distance between us and the ball.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.300
And 1 over the distance
between the ball and the goal.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.090
But now we think of these as being
bonuses that are tied to the state.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.290
Not values that we're getting for
becoming close to the ball.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.260
So there's always this value,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.970
this potential that's keeping track
of how close we are to the ball.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.904
And when we're close to the ball,
it's a big number.

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.740
And when we're far from
the ball it's a small number.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.430
And the reward that we're going to get,
is we change from state to state,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.490
how much more potential
have we've gotten?
