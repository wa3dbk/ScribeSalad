00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.310
Let's take a look at the code in
the UIViewController (Record) category

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.570
in the Objective C project.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.280
To create this ActionSheet,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.660
first we'll need to rewrite the method
presentVideoOptions.Then we need to

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.385
connect that method to the record button
instead of launch a video camera.

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:19.715
So let's switch back to
the swift project and

00:00:19.715 --> 00:00:23.865
rewrite this method in our
uIviewController swift extension.

00:00:23.865 --> 00:00:27.060
Okay, here we are back in
the swift version of GIF maker.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.080
In our UIViewController swift extension.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.290
We've created the function
presentVideoOptions and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.060
first we need to check if
the camera's available.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.660
If the camera's not available,
we want to launch the photo library

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.290
which we'll just put in comments for
now.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.945
If the camera is available we create an
action sheet of type UIAlertController.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.540
Next, we need to create three
actions to add to the ActionSheet.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.950
Here's the first one, recordVideo.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.850
It'll have the default style and

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.170
the completion handler will call
the method launchVideoCamera.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.170
Here's the second action,
chooseFromExisting.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.010
It also has the default style and
this action will call the method

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.570
launchPhotoLibrary, which again,
we'll just put in comments for now.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.440
The third action is cancel.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.860
There's a designated style for

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.470
cancel, and
we can leave the completion handler nil.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.464
Then we add each of the three
actions to the ActionSheet.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.990
Finally, we present the ActionSheet and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.820
set the tint color of
the titles to pink.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.410
In the end, the ActionSheet
will look something like this.
