00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.020
You're not completely alone though.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:02.750
Like I mentioned,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.890
many fields have already been
addressed by machine learning.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.240
Which means there's actually
already articles and

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.390
ideas out there that
you can build off of.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.920
And in fact there's certain areas where
machine learning has already been

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.480
used so much that there are even classes

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.860
on how to use machine
learning in those domains.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.030
Some of those are hosted here.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.800
We already have classes through the
Georgia Tech program on applying machine

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.180
learning to healthcare or trading.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.900
And so if you're interested in those
domains you're welcome to use those

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.070
materials to kind of get up to speed
on how machine learning is being

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.740
used in those areas.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.180
On the other hand there are also
materials on other websites that can get

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.320
you up to speed on how to use machine
learning in other domains as well.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.020
Or maybe you want to choose
one that's actually just

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.100
never been addressed before.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.250
In which case, great,
we'd love to see what you come up with.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.320
So, you're not completely
alone in this portion,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.500
but we really want you to find a project
that's going to be interesting to you

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.550
that as in generate a portfolio item for
you that you'll be proud to brag about
