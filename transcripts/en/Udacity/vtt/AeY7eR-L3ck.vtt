00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.119
We know that the vertex is a special point on a parabola. Because if you

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:08.864
remember, there's a line of symmetry that runs right through the center of the

00:00:08.864 --> 00:00:13.076
vertex, and divides the parabola in 2. We saw that tangent lines on opposite

00:00:13.076 --> 00:00:16.918
sides of the parabola at the same vertical position have opposite slopes. In

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:20.818
other words, if we folded this parabola in half, down this side of the line, the

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:24.238
two halves this is divided in two right now, would match one and other

00:00:24.238 --> 00:00:28.176
perfectly. Let's see if we can make any other general statements about the

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:31.956
behavior of the function on this side of the graph versus on this side the

00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:36.505
graph. For a moment, let's just look at this right half. The corner for the

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:41.243
vertex as I showed you in the last problem were negative 0.75 and negative 2.25.

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:45.787
So for now we're just going to only consider the domain in the region where x is

00:00:45.787 --> 00:00:50.394
greater than negative 0.75. As you can tell on the right side of the graph, as x

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:54.596
gets bigger, f of x gets bigger as well. So I'd like you to complete this

00:00:54.596 --> 00:00:59.338
sentence property. On the interval of the domain negative 0.75 to infinity, so

00:00:59.338 --> 00:01:03.977
in other words, this half of the graph we've been talking about. What is

00:01:03.977 --> 00:01:09.441
happening to the value of the function? Is f of x increasing, decreasing, or

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:14.637
constant? So remember that we read graphs from left to right, so this is asking,

00:01:14.637 --> 00:01:19.411
what is happening to the behavior of f of x, of the value of the function, the

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:23.716
dependent variable, as the independent variable x, increases?
