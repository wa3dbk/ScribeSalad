Which statement I've written here do you think properly describes the way that

00:00:03.348 --> 00:00:07.562
this panda population grew? They are protected from habitat laws, food

00:00:07.562 --> 00:00:12.810
shortages, and predators, so they have a pretty perfect happy panda life. Here

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.147
are your options. The more pandas there are, the fewer are born each year. The

00:00:17.147 --> 00:00:22.178
number of pandas born each year does not depend on population size. And the

00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:25.279
more pandas there are, the more are born each year.
