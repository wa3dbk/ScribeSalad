Try solving this equation. Multiply through by the LCD, and then see if you need

00:00:05.408 --> 00:00:10.918
to solve a linear equation or a quadratic equation by factoring. Write your

00:00:10.918 --> 00:00:15.647
answer here as a set. Keep in mind that not every equation will have solutions.

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:19.554
If ever we solve our equation and we get an exclued value, then we need to

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:24.416
remove it from our solution set. So if there isn't a solution I want you to type

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:27.433
in ns for no solution. Good luck on this one.
