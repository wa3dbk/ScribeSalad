00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.719
And you know you'll need to provide multiple copies of

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.370
this image, so low pixel count devices can save bandwidth

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.100
or high pixel count devices can get a crisp image.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.260
It's possible to do this on the server side in some

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.379
cases. In fact, some content systems let you simply specify

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.180
what size you want a given source image app And they

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.550
deal with the trans coding on the server end including

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.400
caching. If you want the images to actually represent different art,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.510
different crops for example you'll have to do

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.400
that manually. For each of these images though you

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.310
should remember to tune the quality parameters to

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.060
minimize file size while maximizing quality. You'll need at

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.830
least 1x and 2x versions of your images

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.260
although 1.3x and 3x are fairly common too now.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.840
Again, note that although I'm speaking of this as

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.530
1x or 2x, for purposes of device pixel ratio,

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.960
for responsive images, you may request different images based

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.630
on available layout width. You may even want to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.450
change the image itself. For example, in Landscape mode,

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.770
I may want to crop the picture completely differently.
