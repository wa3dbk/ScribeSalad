00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.719
Until now we've been working
on a single machine.

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.920
It's time to start thinking about
scaling up and scaling out.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.830
So let's bring our
expert Adrian back in.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.470
&gt;&gt; Hi there.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; Hey, Adrian, thanks for coming back.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.300
What role do you see containers
playing in the future of

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.360
application development and deployment?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.320
Well if you look at the history of
having large systems in the data center.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.190
Bare metal machines,
typically you'd buy them,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.290
you'd depreciate them over three years.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:28.640
They'd sit at the same IP address.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.640
They get installed once and
used over and over again, and

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.900
you can think of those machines as pets.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.730
What we really want
to do is have cattle.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.140
Right.
So if you lose some

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.080
you know one cow out of a dairy
hood you still got milk, right.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.470
You can get another cow.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.750
That's that kind of model,
rather than having some machine that's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.140
very specific and
if one knows its name and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.260
if they have anything goes wrong
with it everyone gets very unhappy.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.370
So that transition from sort of
these very specific machines to

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.220
more sort of fleets or
herds of machines is

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.440
something that happened typically when,
you know, you can do it with the VMs.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.330
But VMs take out as, you know,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.220
they basically usually you get
them by the hour and they last for

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.120
a few weeks and you know they
have a much shorter life cycle.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.000
But when we go to
containers became efficient

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.160
enough that you could actually
get a machine in seconds and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.390
you could run it for minutes and that
was a perfectly reasonable thing to do.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.422
So, you can create an entire
test environment from scratch,

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:33.453
run it until when and run all your
tests, shut it down again and

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:36.300
you can have lots of those
running in parallel.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.330
So now you've got machines,
some of them you barely know they exist,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.830
they come and go very, very quickly.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.240
And finally, sort of,
if you take it right to the limit,

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.210
you could create a container just to run
a single request and shut it down again.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.390
And that's something that's starting
to be called serverless computing,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.950
and there's a few frameworks for
doing that.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.180
But that's sort of the leading edge
of what's happening right now.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.950
&gt;&gt; So when it comes to writing
containerized apps other than make it

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.210
smaller, what are problems
that no one's talking about?

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.520
&gt;&gt; So one of the problems is
that people get into is if

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.086
they keep their old organization and
the old practices.

00:02:15.086 --> 00:02:18.880
So if you've got a micro service or
an application you are building and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.780
the way you used to build your
monolith was you had teams spread

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.020
all around the world that
contributed code into the system and

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.710
you spent, you know,
weeks of putting everything together.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.990
So when we created software
it sort of followed the form.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.520
That form,
this is sometimes called Conway's law

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.760
which says that the structure
of an organization

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.260
guides the kind of structure
of the code they produce.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.880
So what I'm really saying is that
you can't build micro services with

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.460
a waterfall organization.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.670
&gt;&gt; So people might lose some of the
benefits of the microservices pattern

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.820
with organizational issues.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.720
What about technical
issues like monitoring,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.410
logging what are problems with those?

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.640
&gt;&gt; And so you need much more automation.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.720
That's a lot more moving parts,you need
systems that dynamically discover what

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.240
to be monitored and track them.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.630
So, that's the kind of
characteristic you're looking for.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.350
&gt;&gt; That sounds like a lot goes
into it is this something

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.180
developers are programming themselves?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.960
We're looking back five years when
Netflix first started doing this.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.850
One of the things we had was that
because we were early we had to invent

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.490
a lot of stuff ourselves.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.580
And there was just, we went and
read papers and we built things, right.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.480
And what the situation now is that
there's really too many things to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.330
choose from and you spend more time
trying to figure out which GitHub

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.930
lipo has something useful in it,
which open source project,s and

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.670
which the SAS vendor is
trying to sell you something.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.230
So, there's just too many
choices right now, and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.760
those choices are changing
really rapidly.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.300
&gt;&gt; So, it sounds like infrastructure
is something really important,

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.910
maybe not to code yourself
because there's so much, so

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.420
find something that works, use it for
now change or readjust as you go.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's no need to build it
yourself now, and there's too many good

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.315
options out there, too many things
you can just get hold of and use.

00:03:56.315 --> 00:03:57.865
There're cloud based services.

00:03:57.865 --> 00:03:59.200
There's On Premise.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.260
There's things you can download for
free.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.420
So something that could be an 80s has a
lot of functionality you can just go use

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.580
it and you don't have to go try and
build all that yourself.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.820
So they're building higher and
higher level services on top of

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.500
lots of the detailed engineering what
goes into building these frameworks and

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.019
then you can build on top of them.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.790
&gt;&gt; Okay thank you so much for
coming in and talking about this.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.250
&gt;&gt; Thanks very much.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.770
&gt;&gt; After talking with Adrian,

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.870
one of the industry's leading
experts on this subject,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.099
it turns out that infrastructure is just
as important as the application itself.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.160
This course is going to
cover the theory and

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.740
implementation of managing
that infrastructure.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.814
So in this course we're going to move
past theory and show you how to do it,

00:04:38.814 --> 00:04:40.560
and we'll be using Kubernetes for that.
