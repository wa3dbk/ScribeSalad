00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.424
In this case, we would want u to equal 4m minus 3. Great thinking if you found

00:00:05.424 --> 00:00:09.296
it. In general, when we choose u for u substitution, we want u to equal the

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:15.096
repeated expression in the equation. Notice that the 4m minus 3 is a repeated

00:00:15.096 --> 00:00:19.610
expression. We have it squared, and then we have it raised to the 1 power.
