00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.130
We have come across the notion of similarity earlier in this course.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.720
When we were discussing learning [INAUDIBLE] cases, that particular point,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.740
we came across the matter of finding the nearest neighbor. At that point we

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.410
found the nearest neighbor simply by looking at the [INAUDIBLE] distance between

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.060
the new situation, and the familiar situations. We came across the notion of

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.960
similarity when we were discussing case reasoning as well at that point,

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.810
we came across at least two different methods of organizing the case library.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.030
And that, in one method, we could simply organize all the cases in array

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:36.400
here's an array of several cases in the domain of navigation and urban area,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.700
each case here is represented, by the x and y location of the destination.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.720
A different and smarter method, also organizes cases that are discriminatory,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.660
the leaf nodes of this discrimination tree represented the cases. The root node

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.700
and the interior nodes in the discrimination tree represented discrimination, or

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.480
decisions about the values of specific features for

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.980
example, east of 5th Street or not east of 5th street,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.690
both of these [INAUDIBLE] schemes are based on measures of similarity.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.920
In the first scheme the similarity is based on the similarity between the tags,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.320
If a new problem were to come along it would be more or

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.030
less similarly one of these cases depending on whether or

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.840
not its tags match the tags of a particular case here. In the second scheme of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.420
this [INAUDIBLE] tree, similarity is based on, traversing this particular tree,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.070
If a new problem came along, we would use the features of that new problem to

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.900
traverse this tree and find the case whose features best match your new problem.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.770
Note that the new problem, and the source cases in all of these examples so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.770
far have been in the same domain. Here for example, both the new problem and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.050
the source case are in the same domain of navigating in an urban area,

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.560
in the previous example, the new problem and the source case were the domain of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.480
colored blocks in the blocks world. What happens if the new problem and

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.690
the SOS case are not in the same domain? So consider the example of, a woman

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.980
walking up the ladder and walking up the wall. The two dimension are the same,

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.870
we're talking about woman in one case and in other case, a ladder in one case,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.090
a wall in other case yeah, there's some similarity. Situations like this,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.620
where the new problem and the source case are from different domains,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.380
lead to cross-domain analogies. So the question now becomes,

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.720
how can we find leaf similarity between the new problem, the target problem, and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.260
the source case, if they happen to be in different domains?
