00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.734
Now are there many types of effect size measures? I can think of at least six

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:08.712
or seven right now. But most of them fall under two main groups. Two families,

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:12.790
if you will. The first we call difference measures. The easiest difference

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.488
measure is one we've already talked about, the mean difference. The next type

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:20.204
are called standardized differences. And there are several different types of

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:23.710
standardized differences measures. But we'll focus on one, and that measure's

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.206
called Cohen's d. This is the standardized difference measure we're going to

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:30.969
use throughout the rest of this course. Notice that Cohen's d as a standardized

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:35.339
difference measure actually tells us about the mean difference. It does so in

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.378
standard deviation units. The next family are called correlation measures.

00:00:39.378 --> 00:00:42.778
There are again, several different correlation measures, as with standardized

00:00:42.778 --> 00:00:47.722
mean differences. We're going to focus on one, which is called r squared. R

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:53.948
squared tells us to proportion or percentage a variation in one variable. In

00:00:53.948 --> 00:00:57.783
other words, change in one variable, that is related to another variable, and

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:02.978
sometimes, we say instead of related to, we say explained by. What we mean,

00:01:02.978 --> 00:01:06.698
explained by, is that we can explain a certain percentage or proportion of

00:01:06.698 --> 00:01:12.420
variation or change in one variable by knowing the value of the other variable.
