00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.700
So before we start getting coded,

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.010
let's take a second to
draft up our page designs.

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.210
There are a ton of good mock-up and

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.920
wireframing applications, that you can
download and use to design webpages, but

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.570
for me, pencil and
paper is perfect for the first draft.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.480
So the first question
that comes to mind is,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.880
how many types of pages
this app will have.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.880
So when the user lands
on the root of my site,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.730
they should see a list of all
the restaurants stored in my database.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.070
&gt;From here, they can click on a specific
restaurant that will show the menu for

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.080
that restaurant.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.910
I also want them to be able to
add new restaurants, and edit or

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.010
delete existing
restaurants from the list.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.690
On a specific menu page, the user can
view the menu for each restaurant.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.820
Similarly, they will have
the option to add, edit, and

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.150
delete menu items from a specific menu.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.810
So it looks like we need to create eight
different webpages for our web app.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.380
I will go ahead and

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.090
specify what I want the URL for
each webpage to look like as well.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.020
Draw markup pages for
these eight URLs using pencil and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.580
paper or
your own favorite markup application.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.510
It doesn't have to be anything fancy,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.570
just a sketch to communicate how
you want your webpages to look.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.820
Share you markups,
get feedback from a friend or

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.640
colleague, and then continue on
to the next step of our project.
