00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:04.109
You choose to implement this with a 32 x 32 block,

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:06.380
and your boss comes running into your office

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.225
excitedly one day, saying NVIDIA is shipping a new GPU,

00:00:11.225 --> 00:00:17.887
and it has 4 times the storage per SM, 4 times the registers, and 4 times the shared memory.

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:23.226
You know that your blur kernel is completely bound by global memory bandwidth,

00:00:23.226 --> 00:00:27.876
but now you know that you can run a kernel that's twice as big in both directions.

00:00:27.876 --> 00:00:33.684
So instead of 32 x 32, now it's 64 x 64.

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:39.384
Express as a decimal what is the speed up of your program on this new GPU.

00:00:39.384 --> 00:00:43.647
Speed up reflects my program will run n times faster.

00:00:43.647 --> 00:00:47.647
Again ignore the bandwidth required for the blur kernel in the right back of v_new.
