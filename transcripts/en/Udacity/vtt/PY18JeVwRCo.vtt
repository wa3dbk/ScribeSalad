00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.440
It's a very rapidly changing field.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.181
That's where the landscape
changes constantly,

00:00:05.181 --> 00:00:07.830
the technologies change constantly.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.880
How does one become a successful
cyber security professional?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.010
&gt;From your perspective, I guess,
I'm sure you have heard about what

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.440
it means to be a successful cyber
security professional on your side?

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.110
&gt;&gt; Well I think to be successful,
I mean, you can't stand still.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.900
To stand still is to get left behind.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.640
So you have to have a passion for
the discipline.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.860
And to really be a constant learner and
being able to think creatively and

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.820
consume and learn and create new things
and also be interested in how to take

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.910
things apart and push technologies
in ways that they weren't intended.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.900
I also think though to be successful,
you have to be trustworthy.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.020
Because by studying
information security,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.270
you're learning effectively dangerous
skills that you have to use wisely.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.350
People will put their trust into you and
you have to respect that.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.170
That's really a key, probably the key
underpinning the whole discipline.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.565
A willingness to teach others about
this in a way that's the right language.

00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:13.975
Taking a step back,

00:01:13.975 --> 00:01:17.620
I'd say you have to be able to
communicate technical subjects

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.440
to non-technical audiences in a way
that's understandable and meaningful.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.720
How you communicate with
potentially board of directors,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.210
there's a whole lexicon of how you
communicate with senior business leaders

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.690
or senior military leaders, or students.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.220
It varies, so you have to be very
adaptive and be willing to learn and

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.480
respect the cultures which you're trying
to interact with in a positive way.
