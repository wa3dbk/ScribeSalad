00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.280
&gt;&gt; That's a good point David. Remember that we're trying to store things,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.940
because we want to retrieve things later. And

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.830
if our storage mechanism is such that it doesn't not allow for

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.150
efficient retrieval, then it's not a very good storage mechanism. And as

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.650
you correctly point out, David, as the number of entries increase in this table,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.830
and the number of dimensions we are looking at increase also increases.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.635
This is going to be coming an inefficient for

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:47.110
retrieval. Therefore, let's look at a second method called discrimination trees

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.010
which provides an alternate way of storing these cases in memory.
