00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.790
And this idea of comparing labels,

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.250
we're going to explore
that through an example.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.150
L1 is uppercase L1 is lowercase l1,
comma Comp1.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.390
And similarly L2 is lowercase label l2,
is lower

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.960
case l2 which is the level, sensitivity
level of label two, comma, comp two.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.180
So the comparison is going to yield,

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.940
what we call what label
dominates the other label.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.950
Okay so L1 can dominate L2,
or L1 can be dominated by L2.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.230
Or, maybe neither one
dominates the other one.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.000
So these are the various possibilities.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.930
So L1, label L1 is your dominate, label
L2 if, level 1 is greater than level 2,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.720
and the categories or
the topics that make up compartment

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.370
one contain the topics or
categories that are in compartment two.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.000
So essentially, we are saying lL is
going to dominate if it's higher

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.850
sensitive level, and the categories
actually are a superset, or

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.300
contain the categories
of compartment two.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.050
It it's dominated then
it's the other way, okay?

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.510
So in that case,
label l2 is the dominating one, so

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.250
obviously level l2 has to be
greater than level l1, and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.990
the containment that we had before
has to be in the other direction.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.980
Okay, so this is the subset
relation that we have here.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.790
For the two labels to be equal,
of course, each part has to be the same.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.470
So the levels have to be the same, and
the compartments have to be the same.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.080
So if L1 and L2 are not comparable,
and what do we mean by that?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.800
That means it's one of the first three.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.920
They're not equal, and
neither one dominates the other one.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.090
Then we say that they're not comparable.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.210
L1 doesn't dominate L2.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.900
L1 is not dominated by L2.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.850
And the reason for that is, we're
talking about a label having two parts.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.390
So levels are obviously totally ordered.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.930
So you cannot be,
no you're not comparable.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.590
It's not because the levels that you
have within your label L1 and L2.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.017
It's actually going to be because
the compartments are sets, and these

00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:11.573
sets are going to be, neither one is
going to be dependent on the other one.

00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:14.992
So, they each have some elements
the other one doesn't have, and

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:18.990
because of that, this containment
property is not going to be satisfied.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.720
And, because of that, neither of
these are going to be holding, and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.120
when they don't, then we say that
these labels are not comparable.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.110
So one thing,
if you take these labels and

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.910
arrange them sort of what
kind of structure you get.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.550
Mathematics, actually their name for
that structure,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.420
it's going to form a lattice.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.980
And when you have a lattice,
you have the elements that are the least

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.910
upper bound, and the greatest
lower bound, and things like that.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.450
So you can always find labels that
will dominate any set of labels that

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.970
you have.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.550
So that would be finding an upper bound,
and you can find the smaller such upper

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.620
bound, so that's LUB and
things like that.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.780
So when you compare these, instead of
arranging what's dominated by who,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.070
we get this structure
because of the partial and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.360
the total order we have
on the different parts.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.760
The structure you get is
what is called a lattice.
