00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.537
Many times, when you have complicated conditions, you want to combine them. For

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:07.624
example, maybe you want to do something if one condition is true, or another

00:00:07.624 --> 00:00:12.490
one. In Java, there are three operators that you can use to combine conditions.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.533
They look like this. The two ampersands are an and these two vertical bars are

00:00:17.533 --> 00:00:25.262
on or. And the exclamation mark somewhat is a not. You might find it useful to

00:00:25.262 --> 00:00:29.806
remember that the not equal operator that you've seen a few units ago also has

00:00:29.806 --> 00:00:36.450
the exclamation mark. Let me show you a few examples for using these operators.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.135
And once again, we'll be looking at flags where the visual appearance should

00:00:40.135 --> 00:00:45.858
help you. Let's start with this maritime flag for the letter d. Here, I made a

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:50.369
sketch of this flag. When you're in the middle, the pixel should be blue. And

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.530
otherwise, it should be yellow. So how do we express when you're in the middle?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.969
When the y-value is greater than this level. And less than this level, that's

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.750
where our and comes in, then we're in the middle. This here is 1 5th of the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.112
total height. So, we have two conditions, namely y is at least height over 5,

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:13.576
and the other condition is y is at most height times 4 over 5. Both conditions

00:01:13.576 --> 00:01:17.428
have to be fufilled for us to be in the middle, so we use the and operator.

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:22.672
Here it is. Let's just try this out. Here is the condition that you just saw

00:01:22.672 --> 00:01:28.530
with the and operator here. And in this case, we return blue. Otherwise, we

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.044
return yellow. In this case, I will make a square flag and here it is. So, the

00:01:33.044 --> 00:01:37.434
and operator worked out for us. Because we wanted y to be at least here at

00:01:37.434 --> 00:01:42.597
most, here. Both conditions had to be true for the blue color. Now, let's look

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:46.356
at another flag. I've sketched up the flag here. And the question is, when

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:50.940
should a pixel be blue. In this case, there are four conditions. The x-value

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.820
should be at least width over third. That means it's over here. The x-value

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.470
should be at most, width times two thirds. That makes it over here. The y-value

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.502
should be the height over 3, and the y-value should be at most the height times

00:02:04.502 --> 00:02:09.210
two third. All those four conditions need to be fulfilled for a pixel to be

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.582
built. Now, it's your turn. You'll get to write a program that draws this flag

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:17.450
here with a bit of blue on the inside and white on the outside.
