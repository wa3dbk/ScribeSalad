00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.990
So we've talked about a few design patterns

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:07.760
with MapReduce. We've talked about filtering patterns, summarizing

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.580
patterns, and structural patterns, but what good are

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.040
they? Well, these patterns, can be thought of as

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.130
sort of lenses. To try and view your

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.130
problems through. If you have a big data problem

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.960
and you're trying to do some analysis, that

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.660
at its heart is really about filtering, about selecting

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.670
from a large data set and getting some smaller sample of that data set. There's

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.820
a good chance that you can use this

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.800
filtering pattern. Likewise, if the fundamental nature of

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.250
your, of your problem is summarizing or

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.630
going from a structured to hierarchical sort of

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.220
database. In fact, these aren't all the patterns

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.020
you might want to use. There's also organizational patterns.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.930
There's patterns that deal with input and output and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.960
there's others. But getting yourself to ask this question, can,

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.600
you just have to say. Is this problem I'm dealing

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.170
with filtering, or summarizing, or structural, or something else? That

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.256
isn't simple. In fact, just identifying when map reduce

00:01:07.256 --> 00:01:09.830
is the appropriate tool for a problem is a large

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.444
part of what it means to be a MapReduce expert.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:16.240
And getting this expertise takes practice. This practice can come

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.787
naturally in the job environment. Or you could

00:01:18.787 --> 00:01:21.295
choose to make it happen deliberately by seeking out

00:01:21.295 --> 00:01:23.454
problems and trying to solve them. But, if

00:01:23.454 --> 00:01:26.626
you enjoy learning about and thinking about these patterns,

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:29.249
you should check that book, I mentioned earlier,

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:32.770
Mapreduce Design Patterns and you can learn more there.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.870
But now, it's time to try implementing some

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.264
of these patterns in, in sort of novel fitting.
