00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
Let's look at the answer for
our hit time quiz.

00:00:03.733 --> 00:00:08.980
In a well-designed cache, hit time is
significantly lower than miss time.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.750
Miss time includes the hit time and
the miss penalty.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.190
Typically, we want the hit
time to be very small and

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.540
that means that the miss time should
not be anywhere close to the hit time.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.750
And if there is any miss penalty,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.510
miss time will be larger
than hit time anyway.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.860
So this should be true for every cache,
even if you didn't design it very well.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.500
Hit time is larger than the miss
penalty, we definitely don't want that.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.390
The miss penalty is the memory access
time, if our hit time is similar to that

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.860
or larger than that, then the cache
is not going to be useful at all.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.898
So this should not be selected.

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:47.119
Hit time equals to the miss penalty.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.808
No, we want the hit time
to be significantly

00:00:49.808 --> 00:00:51.560
less than the miss penalty.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.605
If it is equal to the miss penalty,
we might just as well

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:59.175
go to memory every time, because
that's what the miss penalty is about.

00:00:59.175 --> 00:01:00.515
So we should not sell like this.

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:05.425
And finally,
miss time larger than the miss penalty.

00:01:05.425 --> 00:01:10.515
Miss time is equal to the hit
time plus the miss penalty, which

00:01:10.515 --> 00:01:14.900
means that the miss time should always
be larger then the miss penalty anyway.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.010
So this is true for every cache
not only a well designed one.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.390
As we can see, for

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.350
a cache to be beneficial,
it needs to have a low hit time.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.280
In fact, in a well designed cache,
we can say that the hit time is much

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.340
less than miss time
while the miss time and

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.360
miss penalty should be similar to each
other, because the hit time is so

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.320
small and the difference between
the two is the hit time.
