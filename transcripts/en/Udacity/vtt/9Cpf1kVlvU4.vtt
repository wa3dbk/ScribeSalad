00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.390
So here's what we're going to do.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.900
First thing we're going to note is
that if each of these things could be

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.820
represented by a bag of vectors max over
a bag of vectors then all the other ones

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.870
can disappear represented as
max over a bag of vectors.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.820
So the easiest one is the very first
one the first one says that the value

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.960
function at time sub t is the max over
actions of some other kind of thing.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.470
If this is represented as the max of a
bunch of dot products over belief states

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.840
then think about what happens if
you just take all the vectors for

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560
all the different actions and
throw them into one big bag.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.720
So imagine that we've got one set of
vectors that represents a value function

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.170
And then we have another set of vectors
this is for one particular action

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.700
then we have a set of vectors that
represent the value function for

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.060
different action called a2.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.030
So the thing to note is that the max

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.888
over the bag of vectors this upper
surface Is actually the right thing.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:59.152
That if a1 gives the highest answer
in one case then we get that.

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:01.860
If a2 gives a higher answer
in another case we get that.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.820
We can just pull all the vectors
together so this is just a union

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.610
over all actions of the bag of
vectors for each of those actions.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.250
This is a way of writing max as at
the operation over sets of vectors.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.180
&gt;&gt; Sure I believe that,
that all makes sense.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.670
&gt;&gt; The next piece is that the value
function for an action a timestamp t for

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.210
a belief state b we said that
it was the sum over observations

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.690
of some particular vector that
we get for that observation.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.670
If these can be represented using
bags of vectors then this sum, over

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.390
observations, can also be represented
using operations over bags of vectors.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.400
And in particular what we
wound up having to do,

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.260
is take those bags of vectors and
compute what I like to call across sum.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.650
It's basically, the sum where we
choose for each of the observations,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.260
we choose a vector and
then we add those factors together.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.890
It ends up producing
the same effect as this sum.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.370
So what we're doing here is now
given a set of vectors one set for

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.570
each action observation pair.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.700
We're going to create a bag of vectors
just for an action by taking this

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.720
sort of cross sum, summing out
all the different observations.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.690
Because that's really what we're doing,
we're summing out over the observations.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.970
&gt;&gt; So that's just really advance what
we're writing which is you wrote.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah but again it's just
letting us go from this function v

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.170
which is over an infinite state space
b to just a finite set of vectors.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.380
We have a set of vectors and we generate
from that a new finite set of vectors.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.540
So in this case the number of vectors
this first step, the number of vectors

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.300
is the sum of the size of the sum number
of the vectors In all the sets gamma at.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.380
Here were actually multiplying,
so it's the product of the sizes

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.500
of all the sets which is finite but
it could get actually quite big.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.420
&gt;&gt; Given what you say that we should
say out loud that you're making

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.190
assumptions that everything else is
finite to like the number of actions.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.400
Sure.
That was

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.510
already built into the definition of
MDP's that we were talking about them.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.060
&gt;&gt; Fair enough.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.990
&gt;&gt; But yeah it's probably worth
repeating that certainly if the number

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.600
of actions is infinite
then this is problematic.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.160
This union is problematic.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.420
And if the number of observations
is infinite then this cross sum is

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.520
problematic.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.900
So all but, yeah.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.090
Finite state space, finite action space,
finite observations space.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I'm getting the idea.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.700
Basically if you can start
out with something finite

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.740
at every step of the way
you might grow but

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.130
you're never going to grow
an infinite amount in a single step.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.930
And therefore, so long as the number
of steps is finite, or bounded or

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.510
somewhere like that you will maintain
a finite number things in your bag.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.170
That's kind of what you're
doing that by step.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.900
Okay.
&gt;&gt; That's what we're going and and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.270
yeah and if it feels like there could
be a lot of vectors this is true

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.660
it actually can grow doubly
exponentially with t.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.120
The number of iterations of
value iteration we're doing.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.080
But for now we're pretending
that's not a problem.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.681
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean look exponential is bad
unless you're comparing it to infinite.

00:03:48.681 --> 00:03:50.704
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] That's right, that's right.

00:03:50.704 --> 00:03:53.646
We set things up so
that exponential's actually awesome.

00:03:53.646 --> 00:03:54.749
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because it's finite.
