Here's the solution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Two changes are here and here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We pull up the test to this point where we check for solution when we pulled the best path off,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we check for our goal only there, and we don't check for the goal

00:00:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
when we're putting something on the frontier.
