00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.260
So here's a general way of
writing these averagers.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.150
So what we need,
is there's a set of states.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.190
And we're going to need to define
the value at those states.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.040
And there's a second set of states.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.858
What I was calling the anchor
points here, or the basis set.

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:12.475
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:12.475 --> 00:00:13.700
I love basis sets.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.730
&gt;&gt; To define the value of sum state s,
we need to know

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.940
what the convex combination of
the basis values we're going to take.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.740
So we need to have specified
what the basis set is.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.020
It's going to be, part of our function
approximator's going to get to pick

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.880
the value at those basis points.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.470
And we have to pre-define the averaging
weight, the convex combination weight,

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.030
between any given state that we want
to do an approximation, and any given

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.820
basis point, any anchor point that we
want to adopt some of its value for.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.490
So, these are the parameters that
the function approximator gets to alter.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.650
These are all predefined.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.610
Things that define how the value
of other states are going to

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.390
be defined in terms of these parameters.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.380
So it looks a lot like the linear case,
right?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.290
Except, it's not.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.099
&gt;&gt; Well, in particular,
aren't you're missing something?

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.910
I mean, I was going to say it looks
just like the linear case, but

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.240
there's nothing in there that forces
it to be a convex combination,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.779
the way you've written it.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:11.670
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.455
So that goes without saying,
but I should probably say it.

00:01:14.455 --> 00:01:15.150
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.390
&gt;&gt; These particular weights that
we're defining, need to make it so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.220
that the value of any state, is a convex
combination of these parameters.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.280
So I wrote that in math, too.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.250
So for all states and
basis points, or anchor points,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.960
the weight between them is not negative,
and they sum up to 1.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.710
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; This let's us express things,

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.400
like these kind of linear interpolation
that we mentioned before.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.490
And in fact,
even these kinds of smoothed, or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.670
maybe even kernalized
representations work as well.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.380
As long as at any point where
you need to make a prediction,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.260
there is a set of these weights w,
that define how we're going to define

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.500
the value at that point, in terms of
the value of the set of anchor points.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.070
&gt;&gt; Sounds good to me.
