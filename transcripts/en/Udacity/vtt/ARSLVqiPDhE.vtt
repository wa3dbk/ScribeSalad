00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.760
You see there are many different features we could have selected to build

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.570
this model.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:09.150
For example, we could have looked at locations at different times.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.902
For example, at 2 a.m.,

00:00:10.902 --> 00:00:11.924
or 10 p.m.,

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:15.510
where a person is more like likely to be at their home.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.750
We could also have used the (X, Y) co-ordinates instead of the distances.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.280
Or we could have used a different distance metric.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.960
Let's explore this a little bit further.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.243
We could have taken the distance between point one and point two as the absolute

00:00:32.243 --> 00:00:37.580
value of the differences between the X and Y co-ordinates of the two points.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.040
Think about this distance function for a second.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.550
Within cities, only crows and pigeons and

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.650
mostly birds can move in a straight line from point A to point B.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.390
The rest of us, non-flying people, have to cover this particular distance.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.480
This distance is called the Manhattan distance or the taxicab distance.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.500
What features would you have chosen to solve this problem?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.670
Pick a couple,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.420
then use some of the techniques you have learned in lesson two to analyze them.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.330
For example, you could calculate the information gain both for

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.830
the Euclidean distance we chose earlier and the Manhattan distance denoted here.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.360
Check the box when you have done this.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.190
This quiz is not graded.
