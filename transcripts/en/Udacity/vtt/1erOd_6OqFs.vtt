00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.440
Traffic sources can be classified in a number of ways. Data traffic might be

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.550
bursty. It might be weakly periodic, or

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.500
it might also be regular. Audio traffic is

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.470
typically continuous and strongly periodic. Video traffic

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.450
is continuous, but it's often bursty, due to

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.190
the nature of how video is often compressed, as we saw in a previous lecture.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.800
And it may also be periodic. Typically, we

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.930
think of taking these sources and classifying them

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:38.030
into two kinds of traffic. One is a constant bit rate source or a CBR source. In

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.050
a constant bit rate source of traffic, traffic

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.040
arrives at regular intervals, and packets are typically the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.650
same size as they arrive, resulting in a

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.640
constant bit rate of arrival. Audio is an example

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.010
of a constant bit rate source. Many other

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.690
sources of traffic are variable bit rate or VBR.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.830
Video and data are often variable bit rate.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.540
Typically when we shape CBR traffic, we shape it

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.300
according to a peak rate. Variable bit rate

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.480
traffic is shaped according to both an average rate,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.170
and a peak rate. Where the average rate, might

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.540
actually be a small fraction of the peak rate.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.090
You can see, that at certain times, the peak rate, might well exceed the average

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.180
rate. Let's now talk about how to perform

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.050
traffic shaping in a number of different ways.
