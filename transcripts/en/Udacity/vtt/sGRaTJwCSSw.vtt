00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.750
It's time for the final boss battle.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.070
It's up to you to package all of
the awesome gameplay features of GigaGal

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.750
into a polished cross-platform game.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.410
First, we need to add in a head-up
display to keep track of GigaGal's ammo,

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.620
score, and lives left.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.670
And we'll also need to set up
a way to calculate a score.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.690
And we need to start keeping
track of GigaGal lives.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.531
Finally we'll add in touch targets to
allow mobile users to play GigaGal

00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:25.160
as well.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.780
Let's get after it.
