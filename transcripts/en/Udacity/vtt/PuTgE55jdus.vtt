Okay.

00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:03.534
I know the value of a circle is five, so I can replace the circle with a five.

00:00:03.622 --> 00:00:06.993
So I have triangle minus five. But here is my problem, I don't know what the

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.555
triangle is, I don't know the value of it. The triangle could represent any

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:14.320
number, so it's impossible for me to know how to evaluate this. It's okay if you

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:17.144
didn't get this one right. I just want to get you thinking.
