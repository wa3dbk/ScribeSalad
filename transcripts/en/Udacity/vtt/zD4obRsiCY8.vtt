00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.033
So, did you get 94? Because that's the correct answer. Let's review the steps,

00:00:05.142 --> 00:00:09.922
and see how we got that answer. When you want to replace the variables with

00:00:09.934 --> 00:00:14.592
their values, remember to use parentheses. After I substitute negative 2 in for

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:19.055
x, 2 in for y And negative 3 in for z, this is what I get 4 times negative 2 to

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:23.955
the 2nd power, negative 2 times negative 3 plus 3 times negative 2 times 2

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:29.005
squared times negative 3. Once again, we need to use order of operations to

00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:34.117
evaluate this expression. First, I want to evaluate my exponents or my powers. I

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:38.325
have two exponents, I have two squared here. And I have negative 2 squared here,

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.098
negative 2 sqyared is negative 2 times negative 2 which is 4. Remember to copy

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.319
down the rest of the operations that you haven't performed whenever you're doing

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:50.967
order of operations. I also evaluated 2 squared and gave me 4. Now that there's

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.972
no exponents in my expression I can perform my multiplication and division in

00:00:55.984 --> 00:01:00.969
order from left to right. First I have 4 times 4 which is 16. Then I have

00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.896
negative 2 times negative 3 which is positive 6. Now I can multiply these four

00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:09.028
numbers together. Feel free to get out your calculator. Now that I've performed

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.922
all of the multiplication and division, I can go to addition and subtraction.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.766
Once again, I do everything in order from left to right. 16 plus 6 is 22 plus 72

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:24.375
gives us 94. If you're having difficulty, feel free to go back and review some

00:01:24.387 --> 00:01:29.959
of the videos and try again. If you feel comfortable with the material, let's

00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.495
move on.
