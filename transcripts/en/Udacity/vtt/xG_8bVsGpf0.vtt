00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.750
So, let's say we have a problem that we know to be an NP

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.450
but we're not sure if it is contained in P or not.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.780
In that case, there is actually only two things that could be true

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.190
so either that problem is actually NP but we missed it

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.440
so we simply haven't looked hard enough to find a good algorithm for it

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.380
or that's the other possibility the problem is only contained in NP.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.330
So, no matter how hard we look, we will never find a polynomial time algorithm for it.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.820
The cool thing is that for some problems we know that they are closely related enough

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.340
so that it's actually sufficient to decide this question here

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.240
if we missed a polynomial time algorithm or if we just have no chance.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.230
It's actually sufficient to decide this question for only one of the problems.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.360
So for vertex cover, independent set, and clique, in the last unit,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.550
we found out that those problems were closely related.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.390
So, let's just do a little quiz to see if you remember how these problems were related to each other.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.290
So, let's assume we found a polynomial time algorithm for vertex cover.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.340
In that case, we would know for sure that vertex cover is contained in P.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.870
So what will be the case for independent set and clique?

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.940
Would we also know these problems to be in P

00:01:07.940 --> 99:59:59.000
or would it not be possible to make such a statement?
