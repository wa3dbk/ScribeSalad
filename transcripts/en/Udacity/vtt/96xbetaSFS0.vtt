00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.772
If you got 4x squared plus 12x plus 9, excellent work. We know that first

00:00:04.772 --> 00:00:10.212
rectangle is actually a square, each side is 2x, so, 2x times 2x is 4x squared,

00:00:10.212 --> 00:00:15.515
this rectangle would be 2x times 3, which should be 6x. The same is true for

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:21.030
this rectangle,, 2x times 3 makes 6x. And finally for this last rectangle, we

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.504
would have 3 times 3, for each of these sides which makes 9. When we multiply 2x

00:00:26.504 --> 00:00:31.846
plus 3 by itself, we end up with this perfect square. This perfect square has an

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:37.094
area of 4x squared plus 12x plus 9, which we know isn't equal to 4x squared plus

00:00:37.094 --> 00:00:41.618
9. So to answer our original question, no, these are not equal. All the way back

00:00:41.618 --> 00:00:46.440
from unit 1, we said that squares can't distribute over sums or differences. If

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.594
we only squared the first term and the last term, we miss out on these middle

00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:54.547
terms of 6x, these are considered to be linear terms, they only have one

00:00:54.547 --> 00:00:58.938
variable with an exponent of 1. I now it's really easy just to think about

00:00:58.938 --> 00:01:03.423
squaring each of these terms to get this answer, but in this case, the math goes

00:01:03.423 --> 00:01:07.529
against our intuition, it's not true. This is what makes learning math

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:11.702
interesting, and sometimes the patterns aren't exactly what they seem.
