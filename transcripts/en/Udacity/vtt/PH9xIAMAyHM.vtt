00:00:00.243 --> 00:00:03.423
So now, with the cloud,
you can play across your devices.

00:00:03.423 --> 00:00:06.913
And all your data is saved
automatically for you, which is great.

00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:08.929
But what about if you lose the game?

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.652
Maybe a game is like Flappy Bird and
you lose every few seconds, or

00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:13.609
is that just me?

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:14.770
Do you stop playing?

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.082
Of course not.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.350
You keep going for a while and
try to beat your record.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.320
And this is because it's so
easy to keep playing.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.560
Flappy Bird let's you crash and

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.020
burn, then start over just
by tapping the screen.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.830
This is a lot easier than classic
arcade games where when you lose,

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.520
you have to type in your
name to record a game score.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.730
And then insert more quarters
if you want to play again.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.470
So to keep your players interested,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.160
it's important to include
an easy restart in your game.
