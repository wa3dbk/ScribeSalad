00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.440
Congratulations, you finished the first lesson. In the problem set you'll

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.990
get a chance to practice what you just learned. Don't forget

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.630
to go to the discussion forum in case you have questions.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.660
Or maybe you just want to chat. In the next lesson, we'll

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.260
flesh out our data model, and represent more of the complexity

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.340
of a music festival. In doing this, we'll learn about different

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.840
types of relationships that Salesforce provides. We'll start thinking about how

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.540
to play around the layout of our app. See you then.
