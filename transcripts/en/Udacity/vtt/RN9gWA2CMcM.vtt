00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.532
Here's the dovetailing trick which
let's you run a countable set of

00:00:03.532 --> 00:00:04.780
computations all at once.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.570
We'll illustrate the technique for the
case where we're simulating a machine M

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.805
on all binary strings
with this table here.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:16.360
Every row in the table corresponds
to a computation, or a sequence of

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.180
configurations that the machine
goes through for the given input.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.750
Simulating all these computations means
hitting every entry in the table.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.420
Note that we can't just simulate
M on the enpty string first.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.229
Or we might just keep going forever
filling out the first row, and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:33.850
never getting to the second.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.670
This is the same problem that we
encountered when trying to show that

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.230
a countable union of countable
sets is countable, or

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.730
that the set of rational
numbers in countable.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.690
And the solution is the same too.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.250
We go diagonal by diagonal, first
simulating the first computation for

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.840
one step, then the second
computation for one step.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.540
And the first computation for two steps.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.970
Then the third computation for one step.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.420
The second computation for two steps.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.970
And the first computation for
three steps.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.090
And we just keep going,
diagonal by diagonal.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.660
Eventually every configuration
in the table is reached.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.100
Thus, if we're trying to recognize the
language of Turing machine descriptions,

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.728
where the Turing machine
accepts something.

00:01:15.728 --> 00:01:18.510
Then a Turing machine in
this language must accept

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.310
a string after some fixed
finite number of steps.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.320
Say that configuration
appears here in the table.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.560
Well then we'll eventually reach it
with the dovetailing strategy and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.240
we can accept.
