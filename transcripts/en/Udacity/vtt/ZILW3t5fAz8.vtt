00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.922
This problem could be fixed in the body and head code by changing every child,

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:07.535
such as the eyes, nose, et cetera to be at the right height initially. That's a

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.786
lot of work. Instead I use the body and head objects themselves. I move the

00:00:11.786 --> 00:00:15.526
body and head down to the origin by the crossbar's height. This puts the

00:00:15.526 --> 00:00:19.331
crossbar at the origin. The body head object holds both of these parts, body

00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:24.294
and head as children. If I rotate this object around its z axis, it'll properly

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:28.738
go around its crossbar. Since translation happens after rotation, I then

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:32.940
translate this parent object to its proper location. Now the animation works

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.390
fine.
