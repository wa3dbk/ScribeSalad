00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.689
Here are the four answers. Great work if you found those. We know what pattern

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:09.100
of I repeats every fourth power, so we want to take this power of 21 and divide

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.160
it by 4. Doing so we get 5 remainder 1. This means I to the 21st power is

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.520
equivalent to I to the 21, which we know is really just I. For the second one

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.498
we'll take the power of 11 and divide it by 4... Which is 2 remainder 3. So we

00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:31.190
know i to the 11th, is equivalent to i to the 3rd, which equals -i. Since i to

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.950
the 48th is a multiple of 4, we end up on a power of i to the 4th, which is

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.344
really just 1. When thinking about it with a remainder, we know 48 divided by 4

00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:48.400
equals 12 remainder 0. i to the 48th is equal to i to the 0, which equals 1.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.910
And finally for i to the 66th, we divide the power by 4 to get 16 remainder 2.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.997
This means that we cycle through the patterns of i 16 times and then wind up

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:03.330
with i squared, which is equal to negative 1. If this is still giving you

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.744
trouble try repeating these values all the way up to i to the 11th. You'll

00:01:07.744 --> 00:01:11.443
start seeing the pattern repeat and hopefully you'll catch the hang of it.
