00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.120
So let's take a look at how to
add a polyline to your map.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.700
Now a polyline is defined with the
polylineoptions() .geodesic(true) and

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.250
then you simple add a LatLng to that.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.106
You can stack these adds into
a single column as you can see here.

00:00:16.106 --> 00:00:20.910
Where my PolylineOptions.geodesic(true),
I just add LatLng, add another one,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.710
add another one and add another one.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.730
This makes your code a little
bit easier to read and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.300
a little bit easier to manage.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.590
See if you can edit
the hockey application so

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.200
instead of pins for each rinks you
have end points and a line segment.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.640
And as a result you would have a shape
outlining where all the rinks are and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.730
the area contained within.
