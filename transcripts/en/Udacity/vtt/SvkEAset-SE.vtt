00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.385
Okay.

00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:05.065
Let's look at negative powers of ten. Okay, remember, zero is neither positive

00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:09.195
nor negative. But, my first negative power would be 10 to the negative 1, then I

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:12.425
have 10 to the negative 2, or 10 to the negative 3. I know 10 to the 0 is 1,

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:17.165
because anything to the 0 power is 1. For negative exponents, remember, I take

00:00:17.177 --> 00:00:22.689
the reciprocal of the number. So, I have 1 10th to the 1, or 1 10th. For 10 to

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:29.716
the negative 2, I have 1 10th squared, or 1 10th times 1 10th, which is 100th.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.014
For 10 to the negative 3, I have the reciprocal of 10, because the exponent's

00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:44.316
negative. And it becomes a three. 1 10th cubed is just 1 10th times 1 10th times

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:51.567
1 10th, or 1 1000th. So, I have 1, I have 1 10th. 1 10th is the same thing as

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:59.047
the decimal point 1 because the 1 is in the tenth spot. 1 100th here, it's 01.

00:00:59.156 --> 00:01:04.346
because the 1 is in the hundredth's place. And then, I have 1 1000th. I know

00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:07.200
it's 1 1000th because the 1 is in the thousandth space.
