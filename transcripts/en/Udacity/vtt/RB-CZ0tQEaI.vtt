00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.330
So let's look at the whole concept of using,

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.260
again, computing derivatives using cross-correlation.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.290
Let's take a simple example here of an image, of a monarch butterfly.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.350
Here I'm interested, now looking for this, how can I actually extract from this,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.050
the two derivatives, both in the x, which is in the columns, and in y.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.065
What I can do basically is now I can come up with a kernel and

00:00:23.065 --> 00:00:29.000
cross-correlate with that to be able to extract my derivative, I could look for

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.220
derivatives in columns that is x or, I need to look for derivatives in y.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.380
For doing this computation for the original, for del F x, y in x,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.500
how about I use the simple kernel like this, where I take the negative value and

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.270
the positive value, this is what we did in the pa,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.280
last slide, and see if we do an inner dot product, with each and

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.130
every aspect of the image, this is what we get as an output.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.080
This is exactly what we wanted, right, because we wanted to be able to

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.550
kind of look at where there was traverse this way, maximal change,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.490
in an image, which was referred to, of course, as the derivative in x.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.250
Similarly for del y, the chain in y,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.349
we need to create a falter, that has a looks for the derivative change, in,

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:20.167
this direction, which is basically minus 1 and

00:01:20.167 --> 00:01:23.760
1 here, again, we showed example in the last slide of this, but

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.020
in this case of course we would do this for y, this was for del x.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.040
Looking at this process, we will actually now notice the same

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.060
monarch butterfly starts giving me information as I traverse down this way.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260
So basically what we've done is taken these two kernels and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.100
applied them separately to this original image

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.050
using the cross-correlation method, something you looked at before.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.980
Just in the last image you may not have been able to see all the details,

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.590
clearly I'm just zooming up the images so

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.570
you can see the monarch butterfly and the dx and del dy of this.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.610
So in this image, as I traverse, in the column, you can see basically again,

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.180
gradient changes, happened here, and of course, kind of a bright line,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.590
dark line, which basically again shows that there was a beacon, troth, or

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.890
changes in the image gradient itself, and x and y, of course we know there's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.070
the same phenomenon coming down this way, so here for example, you can see more

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.510
details of this part, here, but, we don't see it here, but of course,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.880
coming down in this axis you see more details here, and you don't see that here.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.120
Of course, as we've looked at with gradience we can,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.110
want to compute more information out of it.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.670
This output was generated basically using a kernel process where we

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.760
basically came up with the kernel that I showed you and used that,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.690
to generate these images.
