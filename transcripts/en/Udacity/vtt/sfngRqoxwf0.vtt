00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
There's an easy way to answer this question experimentally,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is just to construct the set where it's a list with each element as the object

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that you're constructing a set from, and what you find is that it's possible to construct a set

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
where 101 is an element, where hash browns--the string is an element.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you try to construct a set where a set is an element, that's an error,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and that's an error because it's not a hashable object.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We'll talk more about that next. We can construct a set where an element is a topple.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We haven't actually talked about topples yet in CS101, but this is something that you've actually use

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
when you return to your values from a procedure that's what's going on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's like a list but it's immutable.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You could figure out experimentally that that's hashable or you could do searches to find out why,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and finally perhaps the most surprising one is that you can construct a set where an object in it is set.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Set by itself is actually a type, which itself is an immutable object.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This question involve lots of things that you might not have learned about yet,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
certainly lots of things we didn't cover in CS101,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but the point of the quiz is to see that well you can do experiments and you can do research

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
using the documentation to answer these questions yourself.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Let's go get how you might have done that.
