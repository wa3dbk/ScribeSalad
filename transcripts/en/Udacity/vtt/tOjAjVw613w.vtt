00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.620
Now that we have seen how TLB's work,
let's do a quiz on TLB performance.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.150
Suppose we have a program with a 1 MB
array that it reads one byte at a time

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.340
from start to end and this start
to end read happens ten times.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.310
So ten times we sweep
through the array reading it.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.150
Suppose also that no other memory,
other than this 1 MB array,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.250
is accessed during this time.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.560
Suppose that the processor has a 4kB
page size, and a level one TLB that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.490
has 128 entries, and
a level two TLB with 1,024 entries.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.810
And the TLBs are initially empty,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.670
they have no translations cached
when we begin the first read.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.860
The array, here, is page aligned,
meaning the array

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.500
begins at the beginning of a page and
the TLBs are direct mapped.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.368
The question for you is, in the level
one TLB, we have how many hits and

00:00:55.368 --> 00:01:01.659
how many misses, and in the level two
TLB how many hits and how many misses?
