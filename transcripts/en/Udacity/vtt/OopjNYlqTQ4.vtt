00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.470
So let's look at what the code for

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.660
this would look like with a quick
walk-through some of the pieces.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.240
You'll need to do something similar
later using the documentation

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.620
as a guide.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.110
Imagine we need to transmit number of
steps detected on an Android Wear device

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.220
to a paired up phone.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.660
Let's open up the MainActivity.java
file contained

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.060
in the wearable project we just created.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.740
So it's in the wear directory
&gt; java &gt; MainActivity.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.400
The data API is provided
by Google Play Services, so

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.215
we need to first create
a connection to this API.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:28.820
Note that this does not
connect to the wearable,

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.030
it just allows your app to make
Google Play Services API calls.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.541
So, after we put this code in,

00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.872
we need to hit Alt + Enter a few
times to add the necessary packages.

00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:40.420
We also need to create a variable
to store the connection in.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.725
And we also need to implement two
classes that are part of GoogleApiClient

00:00:43.725 --> 00:00:46.380
for handling connection success and
failure.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.790
So let's provide the implementation for
those methods here.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.350
We don't have any code to put in them,
so let's just leave them blank for now.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.810
Now, let's look at the code
used to create a data item.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.030
Let's create a method send step
count that does this for us.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.390
We firstly create a PutDataMapRequest
and we need to specify a path for it.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.690
The path shown here is used
to reference this object and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.790
make it unique compared to all
the other once that we can create.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.360
Next we use put methods to add
an integer and long key value pair.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.870
We then use putDataItem to submit the
object, and then we need to check for

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.980
errors with the callback
to find underneath.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.440
Error handling is very interesting,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.520
because it just indicates that the
object was successfully stored locally.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.940
It does not tell you if the object
was received by remote device yet.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.190
It is totally okay for the remote
device to not even be connected.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.500
When the device connects, the data
item will be synchronized later on.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.880
So you'll never receive feedback that
the remote device has received it.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520
If you need this kind of feedback,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.460
you'll need to code up some kind
of feedback mechanism yourself.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
Another analogy for this is that
a package delivery company giving you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.360
an acknowledgment that
the package has been collected.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.910
It has not been delivered
to the recipient yet and

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.640
might take some time to get there.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.400
One important point is that data items
are promised to never be lost and

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.910
will eventually arrive once
the other device is paired up.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.120
Let's now look at the receiving
code on the phone.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.890
So let's expend the project viewer,
and work in the mobile project now.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.070
On the receiver side it's quite easy
to find when new data items arrive,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.508
you simply create a service for this.

00:02:08.508 --> 00:02:12.890
So let's go to File &gt; New &gt; Service.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.360
Create it with all the defaults,
and then hit Enter.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.045
The first thing we need to do,
is make sure it inherits from

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:21.850
WearableListenerService and
add dependencies.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.110
You can also remove the entire
implementation because we're

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.150
going to replace it.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.164
You then override
the onDataChange method,

00:02:27.164 --> 00:02:29.718
which is past an array of data
events that have occurred.

00:02:29.718 --> 00:02:32.830
For each DataEvent object you
can retrieve the DataMap,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.960
and then extract out the path and
values for each key from before.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.860
You can see here that we're looking for
a change, we're then extracting

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.270
out the path, we're testing if
the path equals a certain string, and

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.670
then we pull out the integer and long
value to do whatever we want with it.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.850
The final step is to adjust
the AndroidManifest.xml on the receiving

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.910
side to make sure our listener service
handles the BIND_LISTENER intent.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.390
Google Play Services will then handle
all the necessary behind the scenes work

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.300
to get the data items to your listener.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.370
You don't need to start
the service itself.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.880
So let's expand the project and
open up the AndroidManifest.xml file.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.240
The final step is to adjust
the AndroidManifest.xml on the receiving

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.220
side to make sure our listener service
handles the BIND_LISTENER intent.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.770
Google Play Services will then handle
all the necessary behind the scenes work

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.870
to get the data items to your listener.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.460
You don't need to worry about
starting this service yourself.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.220
Oh, and one more thing.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.470
Let's go back to the sending code and
talk about large items.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.510
Data items are typically
limited to about 100 KBs.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.550
So make sure you do
not exceed this size.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.780
However, if you need to send
something like an image,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.070
it's possible using the Asset class.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.030
You convert you bitmap into
a png byte stream, and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.290
then store it into a data
item using putAsset.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.910
This deals with sending the image in a
way that works around the 100 kB limit.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.430
So that's it for sending data items.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.590
The fundamentals are really easy and
most of the hard work like handling

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.930
the connections and sending the data
is all taken care of for you.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.520
So you can focus on the important
parts of your app instead.
