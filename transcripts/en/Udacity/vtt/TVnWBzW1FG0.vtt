Thanks for working on that problem, I hope you enjoyed having a little space to

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.353
experiment. That's really what I love most about coding. That moment when you

00:00:06.353 --> 00:00:09.600
realize you understand enough that you can start to design your own challenges.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.543
And just try it out. In the next lesson, we'll start talking about how to

00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:16.783
structure your code from scratch. And create packages. So you can share your

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.098
code more easily. I think it will go a long way towards freeing you from the

00:00:20.098 --> 00:00:24.990
Udacity IDE. So you can start coding projects that you invent yourself, and not

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.080
just the ones that we set up for you. See you after the problem sets.
