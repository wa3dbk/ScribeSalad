00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.138
Now there are other situations we can run into, too. For example, let's say we

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:08.685
have 2 robots that are shooting at each other through a wall. Maybe they're not

00:00:08.685 --> 00:00:12.654
the brightest robots in the world. Or, maybe they are. Let's take a closer look

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:16.754
at this situation. We have a few different bounding boxes to consider. We have

00:00:16.754 --> 00:00:20.471
this wall made up of a few bounding boxes, and we also have the bounding box of

00:00:20.471 --> 00:00:24.818
the rocket. So let's say we have this rocket here, and in one time step of the

00:00:24.818 --> 00:00:29.382
physics engine, it is on this side of the wall. But on the next time step of

00:00:29.382 --> 00:00:34.099
the physics engine, it is on this side of the wall. Now, everything in our

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:37.942
physics engine happens at discrete steps, so there's no point at which this

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:43.734
bounding box and this bounding box intersect. So then, which bounding box

00:00:43.734 --> 00:00:48.458
should we use? Do we want to end up using this bounding box, right here? Or

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:52.550
maybe we should calculate some halfway point between the 2, right here, and use

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.737
that bounding box. Or maybe we want to use the entire swept area, swept out

00:00:58.737 --> 00:01:04.986
between the 2 time steps and use that instead. Now the box I've drawn is a

00:01:04.986 --> 00:01:07.838
little bit bigger than the path that would be swept out between these 2 time

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:12.148
steps. Which of these do you think that we should use to properly calculate

00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:16.000
collisions? Check which ever single one you think is appropriate.
