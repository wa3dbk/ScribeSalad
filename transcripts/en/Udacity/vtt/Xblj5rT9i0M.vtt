00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:04.030
At this point, since their were only
three remaining problematic enrollments,

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.100
I printed out all of them.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.880
However, this time when
I looked at the records,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.410
I wasn't really sure
what the problem was.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.030
I ended up asking a Udacity
data scientist if he knew what

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.380
was going wrong.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.970
He pointed out that these students
were all Udacity test accounts.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.620
Which he could tell because they
had is Udaucity equal to true.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.430
These test accounts aren't guaranteed
to be present in the daily

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.860
engagement table.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.800
This is really good to know.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.030
I should also probably be excluding any
test accounts from my analysis anyway.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.220
At this point, there weren't any
more surprising data points.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.130
I did go ahead and move all of
the Udacity test accounts from the data

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.470
right away since I didn't plan to
include them in any future analysis.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.640
First, I created a set of all the
Udacity test accounts by looping over

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.070
the enrollment data, and I found that
there were six of them in this data set.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.149
Then I wrote a function to remove any
data associated with those accounts.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.580
Finally, I called my function
on all three of my tables and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.310
checked how many records
were left in each.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.160
Most of the data is still included,
which is what I expected.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.730
I did create new variables for

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.500
the updated data, just in case I ever
want to look at the original data again.
