00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.632
Let's go through an example. In the last lessons you may have noticed our

00:00:03.632 --> 00:00:08.914
examples have been centered around social science. Like social networking, with

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:13.385
the cloud example and your engagement in class. But in this lesson and the next

00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:17.648
we'll be using a lot of examples from the fields of biology and medicine. Since

00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:21.912
statistics is heavily used in those fields as well. I drew a finch here, and

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:26.388
that's because this next example deals with the beak width of finches.

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:31.534
Specifically, scientist have looked at finches to make hypotheses about

00:00:31.534 --> 00:00:36.831
evolution. By mapping a trait over time, like beak width. We can tell if the

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:42.271
environment is selecting for a particular size of beak width. Maybe there's a

00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:47.390
particular beak size that better help this finch survive. But sometimes there

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.262
are random fluctuation in beak width due to variation in the population. Some

00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:57.900
finches just have bigger beak widths than others. Therefore to determine

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.786
whether there is a significant change in beak width within the population over

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:06.600
time. We need to use statistics. If the mean beak width does significantly

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.462
increase or decrease in size. This is referred to as Directional Selection.

00:01:11.462 --> 00:01:15.620
Then the environment allows the survival and reproduction of finches with

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.444
bigger beak widths. Let's say we know that the average beak width of all

00:01:20.444 --> 00:01:25.948
finches is 6.07 millimeters. This includes finches that have been studied over

00:01:25.948 --> 00:01:30.562
the last few years. But now let's say we're studying a sample of finches from

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.722
today. We want to know, do finches today have beak widths that are different in

00:01:35.722 --> 00:01:41.800
size? That means our null hypothesis is that, the population mean for finches

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.115
today is equal to what they have been. And what should the alternative

00:01:46.115 --> 00:01:53.536
hypothesis be? That mu is less than 6.07, greater than 6.07, or not equal to

00:01:53.536 --> 00:01:55.994
6.07.
