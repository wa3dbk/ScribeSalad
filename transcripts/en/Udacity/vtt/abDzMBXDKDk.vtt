00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.560
The current problem with our list is
that it only shows English words.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.440
But we want Miwok translations
to appear as well.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.409
So here I am in the numbers activity,
and so

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.821
far we've been using a layout that is
provided by the Android framework.

00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:20.280
And it's defined in
the simple_list_item_1.xml file.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.280
So remember that simple_list_item_1 is

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.100
one of many types of layouts that's
been created by the Android team.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.890
And is part of the Android framework, so

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.410
to see a list of all the layouts
in the Android framework,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.660
check out the R.layout page in
the Android developer's guide.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.600
So if we scroll down a bit,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.310
we'll see the item layout
that we're interested in.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.660
So to learn more about this layout,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.900
I'm actually going to do
a Google search on it.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.670
So this is the code developed
by the Android team

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.720
to develop this specific layout.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.840
And as you can see here,
it only contains one TextView.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.920
Now we really need a list item
that has more than one TextView.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.660
So let's build our own
layout with two TextViews.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.310
Then we need to assign view ids to
the TextViews as well because we'll

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.110
need to refer to these views
later in the Java code.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.850
So at this point,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.210
we're not too worried about the details
of the list item layout looks like.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.448
We're just trying to get the right data
on the screen to make sure the logic in

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:15.827
our code is working correctly.

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:20.170
Then later on, we can make the list
items visually look nicer.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.570
Now remember that the adapter knows
how to populate this list item for

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.800
a single word in the list.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.570
And that's why we only
need the layout for

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.870
a single item because that same
pattern will be used repeatedly.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.770
So for this exercise, I'd like you
to create a new layout file for

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.960
how a single list item should look.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.150
And here's an example of that.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.810
Note the 16dp pattern on both
the top and left hand side.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.680
Also notice that the Miwok word
is on top of the English word

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.390
because we want users to pay more
attention to the Miwok word.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.815
Later in the visual polish
section of Lesson Three,

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.780
we'll make the Miwok word even more
prominent by bolding the word.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.710
Next, assign view IDs
to the TextViews so

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.510
that we can refer to them
later in the Java code.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.301
And after you're done with this,
I'd like you to answer this question.

00:02:08.301 --> 00:02:11.440
Which ViewGroup did you use as
the root view in this layout?
