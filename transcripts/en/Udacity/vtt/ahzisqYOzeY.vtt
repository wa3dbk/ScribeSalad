00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.620
This side length, or this side, would have to be something else. We can't have

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.704
negative side lengths, so this first three choices would not make sense. Zero

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:12.288
times 0 equals 0, so that also wouldn't make sense, since that doesn't give us

00:00:12.288 --> 00:00:16.690
an area of 2. One time 1 equals 1, so that also would not give me an area of 2,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.150
so this one's out. We know 2 times 2 or 2, or 2 squared is 4. So this one won't

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.180
work either. And 4 times 4, or 4 squared equals 16. So, this one's out as well.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.763
The answer is something else, let's see what it is.
