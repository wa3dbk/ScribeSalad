00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.860
Here's the project, and we can see
a pretty organized file structure.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.630
Project files go in the app directory.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.770
It's got a single HTML file and several
directories, with the two important ones

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.157
being views, which is for templates, and
scripts, where all the JavaScript lives.

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:20.550
Notice that the HTML file includes
angular down here at the bottom.

00:00:23.725 --> 00:00:29.520
Let's do a little cleanup by fixing
the indentation here, and here.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.790
Most likely, you'll want to include
analytics in your project, but for

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.820
now I'm going to remove
the Google Analytics code.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.280
And for the last bit of cleanup
let's remove these nav links.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.440
The angular generator bundles
grunt into its workflow.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:48.610
Grunt is a task runner, and out of
the scope of what we'll be covering, but

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.560
you can find more information
about it in the instructor notes.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.210
We'll be using grunt to
serve the project files and

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.900
reload the browser
when any files change.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.512
To start the server,
just run grunt serve on the terminal.

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:06.307
And here's our project.

00:01:09.163 --> 00:01:12.399
Lastly, the angular generator
package provides generators for

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.518
every Angular component.

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.975
We've just used this first
one to create the app, and

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.800
we'll be using most of the others
during the rest of the lesson.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.820
It might be a good idea to bookmark
this page so you can refer back to it.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.894
We saw that angular can be quickly and
easily added to an existing project just

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:31.918
by including a link to angular, and
adding the NG app attribute to the page.

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:35.201
But to keep a consistent and organized
project, we'll be using yeoman and

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:37.660
the angular generator package
to create our projects.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.080
Now that we know how to get up and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.790
running with the new angular app,
let's learn how to create modules.
