00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.544
The equation of the curve that I just showed you in the last solution is this,

00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:10.280
f of x equals 4 over x minus 1 plus 1. How can we write this equation in the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.115
normal form for the equation of a rational function as one polynomial divided

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:19.108
by another polynomial. So, you want just a single fraction here, where both the

00:00:19.108 --> 00:00:23.423
numerator and the denominator are polynomials. Please fill this in and make

00:00:23.423 --> 00:00:26.687
sure that the common factor between the numerator and the denominator is 1 in

00:00:26.687 --> 00:00:28.310
this case.
