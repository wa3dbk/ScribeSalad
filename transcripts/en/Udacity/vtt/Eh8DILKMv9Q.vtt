00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.048
For the first inequality, I can add 4 to both sides to get negative 3x is

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.580
greater than 9. Then we divide by negative 3, the coefficient of x, we get x is

00:00:08.592 --> 00:00:13.204
less than negative 3. Remember, we need to reverse the inequality sign here. For

00:00:13.216 --> 00:00:17.734
the second inequality, we add 1 to both sides, then we divide by 5 to get x is

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:22.229
less than or equal to negative 4. Notice I don't need to reverse the inequality

00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:26.699
sign here because I divided by a positive. We only reverse the inequality sign

00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:30.942
when we multiply or divide by a negative. We can graph these solutions on a

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:35.323
number line. x can be any value less than negative 3 here or x can be any value

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:39.809
less than or equal to negative 4 here. But remember, we want x values for either

00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:44.380
this inequality or this inequality. Let's see these number lines stacked on top

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:45.702
of each other to decide.
