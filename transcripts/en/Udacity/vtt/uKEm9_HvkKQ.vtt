00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.346
Okay, why is machine learning useful? So that's, that, that's

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:05.986
a great question and, and it, you know, I, I think

00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:08.746
it touches on this, this sort of classic question, or

00:00:08.746 --> 00:00:12.646
this long running discussion, on what is the difference between statistics

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:16.428
and machine learning. there's, there, there's a lot of great

00:00:16.428 --> 00:00:19.470
papers. There's one classic paper, I, I forget the name exactly,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.020
but it's something along the lines of the two cultures, and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.604
talking about why these two different approaches developed. So I think,

00:00:25.604 --> 00:00:28.269
if you look at machine learning, it, it grew out

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.324
more of a computer science direction, and, and it grew

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:33.534
out of a lot of areas where people had very

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:37.362
practical hands on questions, right? How can we build the

00:00:37.362 --> 00:00:41.180
best recommendation system? How can we make the best predictions

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.685
or classifiers for, for a given problem? And machine learning

00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:47.429
has developed a lot of really, really good techniques for

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.663
doing that, for doing things that work very well in practice.

00:00:50.663 --> 00:00:52.823
And so I, I think that's there, there are

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:55.643
a lot of applications where that's really what you're

00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:58.763
getting at particularly when you have the opportunity to

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:01.643
build a product that will you know, take some action

00:01:01.643 --> 00:01:04.339
based on, based on some algorithms. Those are areas

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.935
where machine learning is really at the cutting edge

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:09.059
of coming up with the most effective ways of

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:11.855
making decisions in real time based on data. I see.
