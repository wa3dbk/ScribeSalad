00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And these simulations for harvesting fish, you see several situations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in which the amount of fish stays constant.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You could say the falls up and the falls down exactly balance each other.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This has caused an equilibrium or steady state or fixed point.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
These three terms are almost interchangeable. I'm going to use the term equilibrium.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In most cases, equilibria can be classified as either stable or unstable

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
even though in some cases you may have a mixed form.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This position at the bottom of the valley is a stable equilibrium.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If you start close to it, you will end up at that position.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This position on top of the hill is an unstable equilibrium.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you happen to be in this precised spot, you are going to stay there,

00:00:47.000 --> 09:59:59.000
but if you're off just by a little, you're going to roll down the hill.
