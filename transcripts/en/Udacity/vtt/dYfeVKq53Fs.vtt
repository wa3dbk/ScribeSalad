00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.230
So to start off with the least exposure, your therapist will probably make you

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.942
hear the word snake and then move up to seeing the word snake and print, remind

00:00:07.942 --> 00:00:11.538
you these two things might be switched and you may see it before you hear it,

00:00:11.538 --> 00:00:18.510
but the fact is these are going to be very low on the list. Then your therapist

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.669
would make you imagine a snake. The next step up would probably be seeing a

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.418
picture of a snake in a terrarium. Then after that maybe seeing a picture of

00:00:27.418 --> 00:00:31.958
somebody holding a snake. And then after that finally seeing a real snake, but

00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:36.321
it's in a terrarium across the room. Then next, you might be ready to see

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:41.156
somebody actually holding the snake across the room. And finally, the most

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:45.239
exposure, would of course be holding the snake yourself.
