00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.420
So let's see if we can now
figure out a RAID 4 array.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.280
Suppose we have a RAID
4 array with 5 disks.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.570
A single disk is just like
in previous RAID quizzes.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:18.880
200 gigabytes, 10 megabytes per second,
throughput and an MTTF of 100,000 hours.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.050
When a disk fails in this RAID 4 array,
we replace it and

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.990
it takes us 24 hours to do that.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.740
So then our 5 disk RAID 4 array has
what data capacity in gigabytes?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.390
What throughput in megabytes per second?

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.650
Again assuming that we do 50%
of our accesses are reads and

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.680
50% of our accesses are writes.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.770
And finally,
what is the MTTF of the whole array?
