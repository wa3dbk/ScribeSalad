00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.750
The latest modern malware is APT,
or advanced persistent threat.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.240
They tend to target
specific organizations,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.440
while as botnets tend to have
bots all over the internet.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.430
APT is advanced, which means
that is uses special malware.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.860
Sometimes, the malware is
specifically crafted for

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.630
the targeted organization, but very
often the malware's actually a special

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.720
version of a common malware that
has to be used in other botnets.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.450
By starting from a common malware,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.840
the attackers behind APT's want to
have both convenience and deniability.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.230
That is, security admins would not
suspect that the malware is APT.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.030
They would think that this is a new
version of the common malware.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.780
Advance can also mean
special operations.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.240
That is, APT is not used for
common attacks and

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.040
frauds, such as spamming and
click fraud or phishing.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.470
Rather, it can be used for

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.950
very high value operations, such as
stealing the design of a new airplane.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.640
APT's persistent, meaning that once
the malware gets into an organization,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.130
it's going to stay there for
a long time.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.780
And it typically
involves multiple steps.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.470
Each step is low and
slow, to avoid detection.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.150
For example, one of them sending
out the design of the airplane,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.620
which is a large volume of
data to the internet at once.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.860
The APT can break the data
into multiple chunks.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.340
And then it can sent each
chunk to the internet,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.630
whenever there is a user connecting
to the internet, that is,

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.930
the transmission of each chunk of
data will not raise any suspicion.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.670
APT is a very dangerous threat because,
as we have discussed,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.620
APTs tend to target high value
organizations and information.
