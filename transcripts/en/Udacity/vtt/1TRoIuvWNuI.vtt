00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.280
So here are the quantities
that make up a POMDP.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.230
We have a set of quantities
that are actually just an MDP.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.820
There's a set of actions and
states and transitions and rewards.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.470
But the thing is that that
MDP that is inside the POMDP

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.720
isn't directly observable to the agent.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.554
And instead,

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:23.010
the agent has to make its decisions
based on the observations that it makes.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.950
So this Z stands for surveysions
&gt;&gt; Or observables.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.440
&gt;&gt; So it's a set, like S and A.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.900
And then we need some kind of function
that connects the states and the actions

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.400
and the observables, or actually,
just the states and the observables, and

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.970
we're going to write that as O,
which is the observation function.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.040
What O consists of is
a mapping from state and

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.370
observation to the probability of
actually seeing that observation,

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.600
given that the agent's
currently in that state S.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.431
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense.

00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.847
So there's a true MDP, and
what makes the MDP really,

00:00:59.847 --> 00:01:03.695
I don't know, an MDP or,
is really the state.

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:07.627
The key thing has always been what state
are we in right now, and what you're

00:01:07.627 --> 00:01:11.579
saying is that with a POMDP, you never
actually know what state you're in.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.034
And so you get these observables or
these observations, and

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:19.046
that's what you see that gives you
a hint about what state you're in.

00:01:19.046 --> 00:01:21.056
But doesn't necessarily
tell you everything, so

00:01:21.056 --> 00:01:23.300
what's a concrete example
of that in the real world?

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.550
&gt;&gt; Well, in the real world, I mean,

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.790
in the real world,
the real world is like this, right?

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.330
So when I'm talking to you and

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.390
some aspects of the state of the world
in Atlanta are actually relevant and

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.040
important to me, like whether or
not you have ice cream.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.340
But I can't directly observe that.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.519
I have to infer the presence of ice
cream indirectly from whether or

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:42.785
not you're taunting me.

00:01:42.785 --> 00:01:43.865
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But I'm always taunting you.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:45.020
But I think I get your point.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.408
Okay, that's fair, that makes sense.

00:01:46.408 --> 00:01:48.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean,
you could taunt me about ice cream, and

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.935
that's not a perfect indicator
that you actually have ice cream.

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:53.150
&gt;&gt; That's true, sometimes I just
taunt you for the fun of it.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.740
&gt;&gt; Exactly, so what I need is some
kind of observation function.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.970
I need to be able to predict, given
whether or not you have ice cream, so

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.810
that's given you have ice cream,
what's the probability you taunt me?

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.490
It's very close to 1.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.840
And given that you don't have ice cream,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.495
what's the probability that you taunt
me, and that's much lower, but not 0.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.877
&gt;&gt; But still close to 1.

00:02:11.877 --> 00:02:13.510
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.320
you won't taunt me about ice cream
when you don't have ice cream so much.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.040
&gt;&gt; That's true, also, when I have
ice cream, you can hear me smacking.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:20.735
&gt;&gt; Smacking?

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:23.380
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; And making mouth sounds.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.070
Well, again,
that's a [LAUGH] kind of observation.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.720
So smacking is a kind of observation
that, again, is indicative of, but

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.748
not a perfect indicator of, whether or
not you've got ice cream in your mouth.

00:02:36.748 --> 00:02:37.742
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:39.000
All right, so I think I get that, okay.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.340
So, POMDP basically has an MDP inside
of it, and you can't see all of it.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.143
And in particular,
the part you can't see is S and maybe T.

00:02:48.143 --> 00:02:50.010
&gt;&gt; The T relates S and A, right?

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.540
The T says how given that you're in
a state and you take some action,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.930
what state you go to next.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.970
But of course, you don't really
know what state you were in.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.650
And you may not know what
state you ended up in.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.380
Because, again, you, as the agent,

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.890
have to make decisions
based on what you can see.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:03.650
&gt;&gt; Okay, fair enough.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:04.200
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.400
Now would be a good time for
a transition to the next slide,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.380
if we knew what it was.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.359
&gt;&gt; Well,
do we even know what slide we're in?

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:13.089
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
