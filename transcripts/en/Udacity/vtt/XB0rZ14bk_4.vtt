00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And here is my answer, to return the probability of heads given a set of probabilities of heads

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and a set of probabilities for each coin, we just need to add up the probability

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of head for each coin multiplied by the probability it could be that coin.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To do that, I will just use this nifty little Python feature

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that let's me walk through these lists together called zip.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We'll just take two lists and gives me the first two items, then the next two items, then next two items

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and so on and I call the probability of a coin coming up heads p coin

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and the probability of it being that coin p.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And so we just need to multiply those two things together and Python has a nice little sum functions

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
which sums up the whole thing and we will just return that.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now the slightly trickier bit is this update piece.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
First to make my life easier, I'll just store the current value of the probability of heads.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We need this because if you recall the denominator of Bayes' Rule is the probability of the result.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now if the result is heads, we want to update our probabilities using the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
same basic method of walking through these two lists together.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We're going to update this by taking the probability for the given coin and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
multiplying it by the probability that we would have gotten that result that is p coin

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which is just the entry from coins which is the probability of heads for that coin

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and since we'd got heads that is the probability of the result given that it's the coin

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and we just divide it by the total probability of it being heads

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and if it's tails, we just need to do the reverse.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The probability of having tails given that it's a certain coin

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is just going to be 1 minus the probability with being heads.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Again, we have to multiply it by the probability that it's that coin in the first place

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and then we again just divide by the total probability of it being tails which is just

00:02:16.000 --> 99:59:59.999
one minus the probability of being heads.
