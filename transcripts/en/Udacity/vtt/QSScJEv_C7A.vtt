If I distribute the positive 40 to 3 8th y, I'll get 40 times 3 8th y. And if I

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:10.856
distribute the 40 to the negative 17 8th, I'll get 40 times negative 17 8th. Be

00:00:10.868 --> 00:00:16.234
sure you carry the minus sign. Reducing a common factor of 8 gives us 5 here and

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:21.071
1 here. The same is true on this fraction, 5 times 3 is 15 over one.

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:26.253
So, I just have 15, and then y. On the right side, I have 5 times negative 17,

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.942
which is negative 85. This is amazing if you got this right. If you remember how

00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:36.246
to work your fractions and reduce common factors, great work.
