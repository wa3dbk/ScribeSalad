00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.499
To find the side length of each of these squares, we actually took the square

00:00:03.499 --> 00:00:09.742
root of each of the areas. We can rewrite 4 as 2 squared. So we have the square

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:14.362
root of 2 squared. This square root undoes the square power, leaving us with

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:19.990
just two. The same thing happens for the square root of 25. We rewrite 25 as 5

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.726
squared, and then we take the square root of 5 squared, which equals 5. And the

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:29.474
same is true for this third case. We have the square root of 81, which gives us

00:00:29.474 --> 00:00:33.879
9. This symbol is called a radical. And all three of these radicals are

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.650
actually square roots. It's likely that you've seen these before, but you might

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.751
not have known there's an index of two here. The index indicates the route we

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.928
are taking since we don't always have to take a square root. We'll see other

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:49.826
types of roots later but for now just know that all square roots have an index

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:54.811
of two, but it's really rare that you'll ever see written. You'll usually just

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:59.210
see it like this. This is a list of some perfect squares that you run into

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.640
often. You want to make sure that your comfortable recognizing these perfect

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.310
squaresm since they help us simplify radicals. Remember, this is the radical

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.500
symbol and in this case, the index is at 2 so we have a square root. We don't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.124
list the 2 for square roots but we know it's there.
