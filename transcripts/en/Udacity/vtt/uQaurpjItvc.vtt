Thank you for sharing your stories. So, here is a document with some

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.170
text that I want to check for profanity. Now the program that I've written,

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.260
reads the text from this document, and then scans it for curse words. And

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.710
when I run my program, which by the way is hidden behind this graphic,

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.220
it says that this document has no curse words. But if

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.960
I go back to my document, and add a curse word,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.700
there it is. Let me save this document. And now if I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.820
run my program again, it detects the curse word. Let's build this program.
