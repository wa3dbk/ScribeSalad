00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.364
We start the number puzzle by multiplying 1 and 12. This gives us our top

00:00:04.364 --> 00:00:09.358
number. The x term has a coefficient of 7. So that goes inside the bottom. We

00:00:09.358 --> 00:00:15.208
need a factor pair of 12 that sums to 7. So that must be positive 3 and positive

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:20.320
4. We rewrite this middle term using the factors that we found. So x squared

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.134
plus 7x plus 12 is equal to x squared plus 3x plus 4x plus 12. We can use

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:30.733
factoring by grouping and remove an x from the first pair of terms and a 4 from

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:35.633
the last pair of terms. This leaves us with x plus 4 times x plus 3
