00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.458
Now, our critical regions are both here and here, not just in one tail. If we

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:09.478
use this alpha level and do a two tailed test to see if getting this sample

00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:15.672
mean is likely or unlikely, what can we say? Can we say it is unlikely to have

00:00:15.672 --> 00:00:21.953
gotten a mean engagement score of 7.13? A mean engagement of 7.13 does not fall

00:00:21.953 --> 00:00:27.761
in critical region. There is evidence that my singing made students less

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:33.260
engaged or a mean engagement score of 7.13 is significant at probability less

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.673
that 0.05.
