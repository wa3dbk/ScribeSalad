00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.840
One way to solve the problem is to simply stop using the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.790
mutext lock on the while statement. This sets off something called the sync

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.130
race where one thread is quickly reading a variable and a while loop,

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.880
or spinning on it, as it waits for another thread to change the

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.800
value of a variable. Because the spinning thread is just checking the

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.590
valuable of a variable over and over. It can't possibly interfere with anything

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.500
the other thread is doing. So we can be reasonably confident this is

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.050
correct. This turns out to be a fine way for threads to communicate,

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.180
this sync race, that is. Actually, if

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.300
this spinning thread has its own processor or

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.750
core to run on, then it will resume its execution very quickly, which can be

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.750
a good thing. However, if processing time

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.520
is at premium, then all this spinning is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.140
just wasted. Hence the motivation for another

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.200
important feature of thread libraries, conditional wait variables.
