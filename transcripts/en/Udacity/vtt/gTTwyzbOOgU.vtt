00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.271
So the correct answer is this one. The percent of faces correctly recognized and

00:00:06.283 --> 00:00:12.290
placed from parts I and II. So this is very precise, the percent of faces. The

00:00:12.302 --> 00:00:18.561
others contribute to your score so if you remember specific types of faces, that

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:24.426
helps you to get a higher percentage. Or knowing whether you saw the face first

00:00:24.438 --> 00:00:29.695
or second? That also helps you get a better score, but that's not how it was

00:00:29.707 --> 00:00:35.230
measured. Knowing whether or not the face was there? Yes, that contributes to

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:40.736
your score. And the tricky one, the number of faces you remember. If the score

00:00:40.748 --> 00:00:46.323
were given to you as a number For example, you remembered, I dunno 11 out of 12,

00:00:46.335 --> 00:00:51.504
that would be the way that BBC measured it but your score at the end was a

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:56.503
percent. So this is how they measure memory. And it's important to be very

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:01.962
precise. And if you got that wrong, don't worry. This was a tricky question and

00:01:01.974 --> 00:01:04.433
it's more just to get you thinking.
