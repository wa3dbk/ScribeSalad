Next we have Narcolepsy. This results from our brains inability to regulate our

00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:09.898
sleep and wake cycles. This results in an irresistible urge to sleep and

00:00:09.898 --> 00:00:14.122
occasions in which they fall asleep for several seconds to minutes throughout

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:18.965
the day. For example, a person with Narcolepsy might be in the middle of a

00:00:18.965 --> 00:00:24.027
stimulating conversation and fall asleep on the spot. This disorder usually

00:00:24.027 --> 00:00:28.588
starts in childhood or adolescence. You can imagine how potentially dangerous

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:33.100
Narcolepsy can be. Consider that a person with this disorder could be driving.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.400
Working with dangerous equipment, or flying an airplane, or even riding a bike

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.953
and suddenly fall asleep. This can cause themselves or others serious bodily

00:00:40.953 --> 00:00:43.902
harm. Here, let's look at this interview with a friend of mine who has

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:44.930
Narcolepsy.
