00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[Narrator] The answer is 300, which you'll need to do to share the key among 4 people.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Alice will need to compute 3 keys of 100 bits long,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and one way to do this is to give 1 person the secret XOR'd with all of the keys,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and to give each person one of the keys.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There's no way to do this with perfect secrecy using fewer than 300 key bits

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because that would mean either we're not fully sharing the secret.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That some party has no part of some part of the secret

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or that we're reusing key bits.
