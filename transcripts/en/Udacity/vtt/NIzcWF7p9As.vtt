00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.655
The add and remove methods, let's you add elements or remove them at arbitrary

00:00:04.655 --> 00:00:09.456
index positions. So if we add a bunch of pictures and now we add one at

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:13.482
position 0, the new one gets added here and what used to be position 0 is now

00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:20.495
position one. What used to be position one is now position two and so on. Now

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:26.763
let's look at remove, here we remove the element at position two. And the other

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:30.345
offsets of course, are now different. Note that you've seen a different version

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:33.944
of the add method when we first learned about array lists. That method did not

00:00:33.944 --> 00:00:37.400
have a position, when you omit the position, then add simply adds it at the end

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.190
of the array list. In the next exercise I'd like you to put add and remove to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.932
work. Here's what I want you to do. When you have an array list of pictures, I

00:00:46.932 --> 00:00:51.458
want you to slide the last one to the front so that all the others get shifted

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:55.719
to the right. Go ahead and give it a try.
