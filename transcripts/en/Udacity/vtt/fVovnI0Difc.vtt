00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.040
So let's take a minute and exam each of these five non-functional requirements

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.730
that we'll be using in this lesson.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.260
After we do this we'll see how each of them influences systems built with

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.330
different architectural styles.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.122
For each quality we will provide a definition.

00:00:15.122 --> 00:00:18.440
The ways in which the quality might be measured.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.330
And some devices that are used to provide this quality.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.120
First off for performance, the Software Engineering Institute's

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.260
definition of performance is, that attribute of a computer system

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.650
that characterizes the timeliness of the services delivered by the system.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.220
And we can measure this in a lot of different ways, in terms of response time,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.740
throughput, system capacity, system utilization.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.190
And there are many devices that programmers can use to improve performance for

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.850
example caching, concurrency, memory management, and so on.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.740
The second quality we want to look at is maintainability, and

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.590
this is the extent to which enhancements can be readily added to a system.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.510
This is sometimes also called evolvability,

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.820
flexibility, adaptability, and so on.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.620
The measures and we have talked about these earlier are coupling and

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.750
cohesion, and there's many devices such as encapsulation,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.670
publishing your interfaces, use of sub-classing, indirection, and wrapping.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.880
The third quality is reliability and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.055
this is the likelihood of failure, of system failure, in a given period of time.

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:23.810
That is, the continuity of service that the system provides.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.400
The typical measure for this is called Mean Time To Failure, or MTTF.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.630
Some of the devices that can be used to provide a high

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.210
reliability include redundancy, fault tolerance, and recovery blocks.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.390
Software safety is the extent to which a system protects against injury,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.330
loss of life, or property damage absence of catastrophic consequences.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.950
It can be measured in terms of the complexity of the system, the time coupling,

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.240
and by fault tree analysis.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.920
Some of the devices include hardware interlocks, in the case that the particular

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.870
system has peripheral hardware devices, and false containment strategies.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.810
The fifth quality that we'll, that we will look at, it is security.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.430
And this is the extent to which the system protects against unauthorized

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.280
intrusion or provides confidentiality.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.650
Security is measured by levels such as confidential and top secret.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.650
And sometimes formal proofs are used to guarantee that

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.380
the system obeys whatever its confidence level is.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.380
Some of the devices include authentication, authorization, security kernels,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.290
encryption, auditing and logging, and access control mechanisms
