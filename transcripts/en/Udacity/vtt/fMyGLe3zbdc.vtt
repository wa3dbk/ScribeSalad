00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.920
Welcome to my office.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.939
I thought before we'd start I should
give you some tips on how to do well in

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.220
the class.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.890
Step one is take a look at
the course readiness survey.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.610
It's the minimum CS and Math-101 that
I think you need to even get started.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.329
Next, there are these videos.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.400
The videos are about
building your intuition.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.950
And like other courses in the series,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.650
there are little quizzes
sprinkled throughout.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.190
I'd advise you not to skip
the quizzes because I like

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.080
to stick new concepts there.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.700
And beyond the videos,
there are readings.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.760
Where the videos are about
building your intuition,

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.760
the readings are about spelling
out all the gory, formal details.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.870
And you're going to need those details
in order to do the mini projects and

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.470
the exams.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.292
Finally, there are the mini projects.

00:00:47.292 --> 00:00:51.790
The mini projects are about writing real
code because you don't really understand

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.610
an algorithm or a data structure until
you've tried to implement it yourself.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.140
Especially, if you're trying to
understand something about engineering

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.340
tradeoffs.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.980
Okay, so that's it for kind of
logistics and philosophy of the class.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.860
With that fluffy stuff out of the way,
let's talk HPC.
