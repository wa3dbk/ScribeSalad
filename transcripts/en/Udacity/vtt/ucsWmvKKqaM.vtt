When we look at a scene, we can't always tell how far away objects are. Our

00:00:03.848 --> 00:00:08.234
eyes, well at least my eyes, are not laser scanners. They don't return z depths

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:11.736
directly to my brain. Maybe another way to say it, is that we're not bats and

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:16.580
don't use sonar. Our eyes detect what is called the radiance coming from each

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.080
direction. Our brain figures out distances from a variety of visual cues. We're

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.811
not even particularly aware of these cues. For example, it wasn't until the

00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:27.692
renaissance that painters figured out that distant mountains had a blue tinge,

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:32.311
and so started to paint them that way. However, the actual amount of light from

00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.670
those distant mountains is a given amount of radiance. We don't store depth.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.850
One way to think about radiance is in terms of a function called the light

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.962
field. The idea of the light field is that for any point in the universe, and

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:47.342
for all directions from that point there is an incoming radiance value that we

00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:52.811
can record. Say we're sitting at a desk. For our location we can look around

00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:57.375
and see a color in any direction. In computer graphics terms, we're recording a

00:00:57.375 --> 00:01:01.748
radiance for each different, specific direction we look. To form an image, we

00:01:01.748 --> 00:01:06.192
find the radiance coming through each pixel. Imagine we have a sensor floating

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:09.780
in space that can move anywhere and look in any direction. I like to think of

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.560
the sensor mounted on a turret, with the turret rotating as needed. The

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.400
question to you is, how many numbers, how many variables do we need to specify

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.300
our imaginary sensor's location and direction so that we can record the light

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.890
traveling through any point in the universe from any direction?
