00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, so we just ran some queries on our list of 25 links by hand,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and that was a little tedious, so what are some of the downsides of querying data by hand?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, I know we only had 25 links there,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
but one problem is it's very error-prone.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You have to write code for every query you want to answer,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and if you don't get the sort order right or something like that,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you have trouble.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's tedious.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I could ask you a lot of questions about--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
get these links sorted by this and that and links submitted by this user and that user,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and writing a function for each of those can be a bit tedious,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and one of the most important reasons is it's slow.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Now, you didn't see that yet because we only had 25 links,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and iterating over all of those links sequentially wasn't a problem.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
There's only 25 links.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But if there were a million links or a billion links,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
you wouldn't want to do that, or you wouldn't even be able to do that.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I wouldn't have even been able to build that kind of fake database in memory

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
like I did there, so databases basically exist

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to take big chunks of data, like our collection of links,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
which could be in the millions, and answer queries on them

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in a reasonable amount of time without

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
having to write a lot of custom code, which is always an option.
