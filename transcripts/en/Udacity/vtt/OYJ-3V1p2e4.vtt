00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.890
Now in a previous lesson, we looked at how AS path pre pending, can be used

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.930
to control inbound traffic. As it turns out,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.240
longest prefix match, can also be used to

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.040
control inbound traffic. Suppose, that ASA owns 10.1.0.0/16,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.220
and it might advertise that prefix Both of

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.630
it's upstream links and that route might similarly

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.220
be advertised further upstream. Now of course as

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.660
we know from a previous lesson, given the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.450
advertisement of one prefix upstream, ASD is going to

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.970
pick one best BGP route; along which to

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.200
send traffic back to A. But let's suppose

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.600
that ASA wanted to balance that traffic, across

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.420
its incoming links. Well in that case, ASA

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.260
could actually advertise routes for 2 more specific

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.820
prefixes, effectively splitting the slash 16 in half,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.300
so in addition to advertising 10.1/16, across

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.950
both links, ASA might advertise 10.1/17 on

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.770
the top link and 10.1.128.0/17, the other half of the /16 on the bottom

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.880
link. Now, if either link fails, the covering /16 will ensure that the prefix

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.810
remains reachable by one of the two

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.950
upstream links. But because longest prefix match.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.380
Wins the traffic for 10.1.128 would now traverse

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.810
the bottom link, and the traffic for 10.1/17 would

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.820
now traverse the top link, effectively sending traffic

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.230
for half of the prefixes along the top path

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.320
and traffic for the other half of the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.070
prefixes along the bottom path. Although we just explored

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.400
a perfectly good reason to deaggregate a contiguous prefix,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.700
it turns out that sometimes autonomous systems may deaggregate

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.990
larger prefixes unnecessarily. A report called

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.830
the CIDR Report, which is released weekly,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.650
shows autonomous systems who are advertising IP

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.279
prefixes. That, at least according to observation,

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:59.790
are continuous and could be aggregated. For example, the top offender for the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.160
week of December 12th, 2013, was AS6389.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.760
This single autonomous system, is actually advertising

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.680
more than 3,000 unique IP prefixes. The cider report analysis, suggests that.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.950
With appropriate aggregation, this autonomous system

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.180
could instead advertise only 56, unique, IP

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.580
prefixes. Now this might be overly optimistic. As we just explored, there

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.620
are perfectly good reasons, to deaggregate

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.080
a contiguous IP prefix, into multiple smaller

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.610
contiguous IP prefixes. But nonetheless, the report shows,

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.670
that there are probably a lot more IP prefixes,

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.530
in the Global Internet Routing table, than there

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.600
could be, if AS's took full advantage of aggregation.
