00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.010
Here's a specific example I want to show you so

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.020
you can see how other audience members might view the graphic.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.300
You don't want to create a visualization that confuses or

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.680
alienates your readers.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.740
And that's why you want to avoid using standard red and green colors.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.430
They're often hard for those who are color blind to interpret.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.760
The difference between these red bars and this green text may seem obvious to

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.470
you, however, not everyone will see it this way.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.680
Some viewers in your audience will see this.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.950
Here there is little to no difference between the red bars that we

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.110
say before and the green text.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.490
And now I want to make a subtle distinction, here.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.370
I'm not saying that you should never use red or

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.110
green hues, because they can be used in visualizations.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.150
This graphic was re-released after a color correction from

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.805
the Wall Street Journal.

00:00:48.805 --> 00:00:50.930
It's a heat map that shows historic trends for

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.620
unemployment in the United States.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.070
The rose represent the months of the year and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.070
the columns represent one year of time.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.129
The key here is that hues of red and green were used in such a way

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.670
that people even with color blindness could still make out the differences.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.320
Now this is a pretty incredible interactive graphic.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.710
And it also makes use of a diverging color scale.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.260
But, if you want to see something even more incredible, I highly recommend that

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.360
you check out the remake of this visualization in the instructor notes.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.910
Alberto Cairo, a professor at the University of Miami, redesigned this graphic,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.350
and you can also find it in his book, The Functional Art.
