00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.251
Now, the answer is no. Within the population of everyone who took the BBC test,

00:00:05.365 --> 00:00:10.731
you guys are a sample. There are a lot of different samples we could take of all

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:16.109
the people that took the test. We can take big samples, and small samples. And,

00:00:16.222 --> 00:00:21.002
while your sample could get the same averages as those from the entire

00:00:21.014 --> 00:00:26.553
population. There will also be samples that don't have the same averages. The

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:31.935
average memory score of the population is called the population parameter and

00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:37.211
it's denoted by mu. It's a funny little Greek symbol. And the average for the

00:00:37.223 --> 00:00:42.429
sample is called a sample statistic and we generally denote it by x bar. An x

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:47.380
with a bar on top. Now, I want to stress, please don't be nervous about symbols.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.160
I know a lot of people get pretty nervous when they see symbols that they

00:00:52.172 --> 00:00:57.328
haven't seen before. But in mathematics, we really need symbols to illustrate

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.571
our points. Think of it like, when you're playing a musical instrument, and you

00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.310
have sheep Sheet music.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:09.300
How else are we going to make sure that people in future generations learn these

00:01:09.312 --> 00:01:14.160
classical melodies? Sheet music is the best way to do that. And same with, in

00:01:14.172 --> 00:01:19.085
mathematics when we use symbols. We need to be able to articulate are thoughts

00:01:19.097 --> 00:01:24.010
to other people all around the world. And that's one things that's really cool

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:29.421
about mathematics it's a universal language. So don't worry, you'll soon become

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:34.457
familiar with these symbols because we're going to use them throughout this

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.444
course. Now we can use this sample statistic to approximate the population

00:01:39.456 --> 00:01:44.925
parameter. But generally, they won't be exactly the same. The difference between

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:50.261
these two is called the sampling error. Which means we can make educates guesses

00:01:50.273 --> 00:01:55.519
about population parameters using sample statistics, but we probably won't be

00:01:55.531 --> 00:02:00.704
100% accurate. That's why it's really important to have a good sample that can

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:05.914
better predict the population parameter. So going back the quiz, no. We don't

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:11.014
think that the average scores for this class will be exactly the same. But it

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:13.673
will probably come close, and we're going to be able to see that later.
