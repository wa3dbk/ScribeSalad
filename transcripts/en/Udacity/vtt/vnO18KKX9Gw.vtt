00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.780
The prevailing alternative and the one that is

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.980
used in most operational networks today is link state

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.590
routing. In link state routing, each node distributes

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.200
a network map to every other node in the

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.580
network. And then, each node performs a shortest

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.030
path computation between itself and all other nodes in

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.300
the network. So initially, each node adds the cost

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.000
of its immediate neighbors, D(v), and every other distance

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.189
to a node that is infinite. Then each node floods the cost between nodes u and v

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.100
to all of its neighbors. And the distance to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.930
any node v becomes the minimum of the cost

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.990
between u and w plus the cost to w. Or the current shortest path to v. The

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.930
shortest path computation is often called the dijkstra, shortest

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.200
path ROUTING ALGORITHM. Two common link state routing protocol

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.390
are open shortest paths first or OSPF and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.030
intermediate system - intermediate system or IS-IS. In

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.710
recent years, IS-IS has gained increasing use in

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.110
large internet service providers and is the more

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.950
commonly used. Link state routing protocol in large

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880
transit networks today. One problem with link state

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.540
routing is scale. The complexity of a link

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.270
state routing protocol grows as n cubed where n

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.690
is the number of nodes in the network.
