00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.170
in the last node,

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.300
we mentioned that meaningful
apps come from great intention.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.990
Now the best way to
surface this intention

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.940
is to build a user interface that's
easy to use and has clear value.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.200
For the quake report app,

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.360
we want to allow users to get a sense of
earthquake activity around the world.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.150
In order to do that, we've identified
certain pieces of metadata that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.830
will be most helpful in
understanding that activity.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.580
We even came up with a few Macleod
ideas for how to display that data.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.170
And to kick them up to another level,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.080
we roped in one of our UX designers
to develop a more refined design.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.950
Let's take a look at the final mock up.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.730
Okay, so here's the design
mock of the main list view.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.150
Simple and clean, right?

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.020
Pretty cool.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.300
Now, if we zero in here on the list item
design, you'll notice on the left that

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.325
we have a colored circle that
contains the magnitude of quake.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:50.160
Now also notice the fluctuation in color
that we have here in these different

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.210
circles to reflect the change
in magnitude strength.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.500
Now, this is the most important
piece of information about a quake.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.870
So the circle and the color provide
a good way to draw prominence to this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.770
piece of important data.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.910
Now in the center, we have the general
location name with the details

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.670
highlighted above it using a slightly
bolder font, all caps and lighter text.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.210
Now all these subtle choices combine to
help focus the user on what's important.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.080
And then lastly,
on the right side we have the date and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.260
the time formatted nicely.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.620
Also using a similar stacked layout
as location name in the details.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.570
Some of you may be thinking what do I do
if I don't have access to a designer?

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.310
Now while it's certainly advantageous
to have a formal design perspective,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.070
it's also very possible to channel
some solid design on your own.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.890
It may just mean you'll have to
spend some more time iterating on

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.110
a design idea.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.420
And ground your ideas around some
guidelines such as the material design

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.830
guidelines here.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.060
See the instructor notes for some
additional tips on building a great UI.
