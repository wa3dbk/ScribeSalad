00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.740
Right now we see a picture of a phone
but this isn't actually on our phone.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.430
This is pretty similar to when we
were working with the XML visualizer.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.110
Now we actually want to
see our app on our phone.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.330
To participate you're going to
need a USB cable like this.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:20.575
Now, this USB cable should fit your
Android phone but you will also need.

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:26.500
What do I mean by fit well, I could pick
up my phone and plug this cable into it.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Now, if you don't have these things
there's a slightly more complicated way

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.400
you could get up and running, which I'm
going to talk about in the next video.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.540
But if you have both of these items,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.600
I really encourage you
to use a real device.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.510
It's a lot more fun that way.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.650
All right.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.739
First things first.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.470
Your phone is not set up to let random
code from your computer right on your

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.190
phone by default.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.330
So you're going to need to do
a few steps to prep your phone.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.870
Okay.
So the first step is to become

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.129
a developer.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.360
This sounds a little funny.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.500
When will you know when
you're a developer.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.100
Well what this actually means is
changing around a couple of settings on

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.680
the phone, which will allow you
to access developer options.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.390
Once your phone's set up, you'll
connect your phone to your computer

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.440
using the USB cable that
I talked about before.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.590
Now if you're using a Windows machine,
the third step for you and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.740
Windows only will be
to install a driver.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.970
And the driver's an extra little bit
of software that will allow your

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.669
phone to communicate with
your Windows machine.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.740
With Macs, this just works by default,
so you don't have to worry about it.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.800
And finally you'll install your app.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.810
All right let's start doing these steps.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.400
On newer phones running
in Android 4.2 and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.140
later, you need to tell your
phone that you're a developer.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
This is a pretty simple process
I'll show you right now.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.380
The way to do this is to
navigate to the settings menu.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.450
Once you here, scroll down to
the bottom and click on about phone.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.390
On this menu also scroll
down to the bottom.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.490
You should see something
that says build number.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.860
Okay so take the builder and
click it seven times cool.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.670
So now suddenly your developer,
wasn't that easy.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880
Once you're done go ahead
of the back button.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.679
Okay, now in developer options there's
a bunch of fancy sounding options but

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.950
what I want you to do is scroll down
until you see USB debugging and

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.450
then go ahead and click will check box
next to USB debugging to turn it on and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.179
say okay by checking this box it's
allowing your computer to put

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.160
applications onto your phone.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Awesome.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.500
Now that you've enabled that you can
take your handy dandy USB cable plug one

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.802
end into the phone and take the other
end and plug it into your computer.

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:31.400
If you're a Windows device there's
one more step to set up your phone

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.620
and computer.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.300
Your Windows machine needs
some software called a driver

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.550
to communicate with your phone.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.620
I'll start by downloading the driver.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.195
For most phones besides
Google Nexus phones,

00:02:41.195 --> 00:02:44.167
you could navigate to
the android OEM which stands for

00:02:44.167 --> 00:02:47.153
Original Equipment Manufacturers
driver website.

00:02:47.153 --> 00:02:49.150
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:50.825
A link is provided in
the instructor notes.

00:02:50.825 --> 00:02:55.959
I'm going to scroll down to the bottom,
here I've a list of drivers for

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.990
different phones and I'll go ahead
a double at the appropriate one.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.180
In my case I have a Nexus phone so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.680
I'm going to go up on the page and
click Google USB driver.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.360
This is, again, for Nexus phones.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.150
Okay, so for me, I'm going to go ahead
and download the Google USB driver.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.732
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:03:18.732 --> 00:03:21.440
Unzip it.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.880
I'm going to move this to my desktop.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.790
So at this point I've
downloaded the driver,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.600
I've unzipped it, and
I put it on my desktop.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.590
What you need to do next is double check
that your phone is actually plugged in.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.810
Okay, let's look at our Taskbar.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.000
I'm going to click on the Start Menu and
go to Computer.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.769
In Windows Explorer, I'm going to
right click on the word here that says

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.330
Computer and then I'll go to Manage.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.459
In this left pane here I'm
going to select Device Manager.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.250
So looking through this list,
go ahead and

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.160
find the thing that says
other devices and expand it.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.480
Now you should see something
here that refers to your phone.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.965
For example, Nexus S.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:05.505
or A D.B. which stands for
Android Debug Bridge interface.

00:04:05.505 --> 00:04:10.190
Okay, so I'm going to right click and
select update driver software.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.730
This is going to launch a wizard
that looks like this and

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.540
I want to select the one that let's me
browse my computer because remember I

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.100
just downloaded it to my desktop.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.579
So I do browse computer and I'm
going to go ahead and click browse and

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.800
going to my desktop and
hit OK and hit next.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.100
I might see some security messages
like this go ahead and say install.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.100
All right, cool.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.900
So, this autoplay just
popped up with my Nexus 6 so

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.900
that's a good sign that now the computer
is communicating well with my phone.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.950
I'm going to go ahead and close this.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.820
And the final window of
the Wizard says that Windows has

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.440
successfully updated your driver
software so that sounds awesome.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.330
I'll go ahead click close.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.349
Basically at this point your phone's
ready to accept the application

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.750
from your computer.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.460
Another way of saying that you can now
install apps that you've built on your

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.549
computer onto your phone.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.600
Finally we're going to install our
hello world app from the computer

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.190
on to the phone.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.100
To do this you're going to go
up to the top of Android Studio

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.360
to this green play button and click it.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.700
It will take about ten seconds or
so for the next window to pop up so

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.229
be patient at the bottom of the screen

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.930
you should be able to see that
there's some process being executed.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.840
Now if everything went as planned your
computer should detect your phone and

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.250
listed here.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.520
Make sure you have the chooser running
device radio button clicked and

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.740
not the launch emulator
radio button selected.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.170
If you can't see your phone try
unplugging it and replugging it in.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.470
And then try restarting the phone.

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.820
If that also doesn't work and

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.409
you're on a Windows machine, you might
have installed the wrong driver.

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.760
If none of those solutions
seem have solved your problem,

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.789
we've created a troubleshooting document
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.600
And you can always try asking your
fellow students for help on chat or

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.640
in forums.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.719
Okay but hopefully things are working.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.620
You can select your phone and
click the OK button.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.310
After about five seconds, you should
see your phone looks like this.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.300
You've now successfully run your
first Android application on a phone.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.570
Awesome work.
