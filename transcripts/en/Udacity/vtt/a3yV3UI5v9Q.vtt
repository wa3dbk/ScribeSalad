00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now, for a bit of advice on assertions. First of all, assertions take time.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If for every single operation on a large data structure, you're to traverse the anti-tree

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in order to check it for consistency,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
these operations will be no longer logarithmic time but at least linear time.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
A check on a square root result will not matter that much,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but if you need to traverse large data structures, it will.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is why assertions can be turned off.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The way assertions are being turned on and off differs from the language used.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In Python, there is a -O option which turns assertions off. -O stands for optimized.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In C/C++, the compiler option -DNDEBUG for no debugging also turns assertions off.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In Java, there is an option -ea for enable assertions which turns assertions on.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Java special by having assertions turned off by default.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Not very surprisingly, the assert keyword in Java is the least frequently used

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of all keywords in Java, which in my view is a big, big shame.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The fact that assertions can be turned off and frequently will also implies that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that assertions must not change the program semantics.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Whether assertions are turned on or turned off, the behavior of the program should be the same.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Suppose you're developing this cool map application,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which also supports setting pins for individual locations.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, you want to make sure that if you remove a location,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the appropriate function returns the right value so just remove it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And if you're right, assert map.remove location equals to True,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in order to make sure that remove location returns the true value that's dangerous

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
because if the assertion is turned off here, then not only does the check go away

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
but actually also the call to remove.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Generally speaking, if anything in your assertion has side effects such as this one,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
don't put it into the assertion.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What you do instead is you put the functionality into code that is outside of the assertion

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and then use the assertion only for checking the result.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This way if the assertion is turned off has no effect

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
then the semantics of the program will still be unchanged except that the checks will be gone.
