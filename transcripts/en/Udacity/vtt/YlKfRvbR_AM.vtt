00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.480
There will be due dates to help you stay on track. The summer course is on a

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.814
condensed schedule. We will be covering 15 weeks of content in ten weeks, so

00:00:07.814 --> 00:00:12.472
keeping up is vital. There is a draft version and a final version of each

00:00:12.472 --> 00:00:16.470
problem set. There are three main exercises due on Wednesday, and a draft

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.884
version due on the Sunday before. The draft will help you start thinking about

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:25.535
the problems, so you can ask questions early. There will also be about 20 short

00:00:25.535 --> 00:00:31.030
problems due with the final version of the problem set. Problem sets are always

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:36.838
due at 11:55 p.m. U.S. Pacific time. You can work ahead. We especially

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:41.760
recommend this if you have travel plans. We cannot accept late problem sets.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.408
It's important that we post the solutions shortly after the due date and it is

00:00:45.408 --> 00:00:49.439
not fair to accept work after the solutions are put up.
