00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.682
Did you get 3 x minus 4 y equals negative 8? If so, that is awesome. Now what

00:00:05.682 --> 00:00:11.708
makes this problem easier than the last one? Well first, the slope is given, so

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:17.563
we don't have to calculate the slope. The other is if we look at the point 0, 2.

00:00:17.563 --> 00:00:24.398
The point 0, 2 is actually the y intercept because x is 0 and y is 2. Now if we

00:00:24.398 --> 00:00:31.006
know the slope and we know the y intercept, we can very easily use a slope

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:37.838
intercept form and write y equals mx plus b which equals 3 4th times x plus 2

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:44.100
which is the y intercept. Since we want to write the equation in standard form,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.203
I'm going to go ahead and multiply the equation through by 4. Giving me 4y

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:54.531
equals 3x plus 8. And if I want to write this in standard form. I need to move

00:00:54.531 --> 00:01:00.297
the 3x over to the other side. Which would give me negative 3x plus 4 y equals

00:01:00.297 --> 00:01:06.566
8. Now you might be asking, why is this answer different from this answer? Well,

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:12.952
they're actually the same. If I were to take this equation and multiply the

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:19.972
whole equation through by negative 1, I'm going to get negative 1 times negative

00:01:19.972 --> 00:01:26.884
3x gives me 3x negative 1 times positive 4y gives me negative 4y and negative 1

00:01:26.884 --> 00:01:33.713
times positive 8 gives me negative 8. So as you can see this equation negative

00:01:33.713 --> 00:01:39.935
3x plus 4y equals 8 is the same as the equation 3x minus 4y equals negative 8

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:45.647
Our convention typically use a math is that we do not have a negative

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:48.309
coefficient to our x variable.
