00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.559
One interesting therapeutic potential that you are conducting, one of your

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:07.110
studies, is the use of psilocybin in the treatment of nicotine dependence which

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.458
seems kind of counterintuitive. Could you talk a little bit about that study?

00:00:12.458 --> 00:00:18.010
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yes, yes. So back in the 1950s and 60s there, were several studies done

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.249
primarily with LSD and treatment of alcoholism. And those studies were done in

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:30.109
a way that is very difficult to interpret the validity of their results,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.546
according to our own.

00:00:33.546 --> 00:00:35.272
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Their methodology?

00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:40.183
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Partly methodology, partly how they handle the data. So, given the experience

00:00:40.183 --> 00:00:44.152
we had with patients at Johns Hopkins we thought we would put together an

00:00:44.152 --> 00:00:49.826
intervention to look at addictions. We picked cigarette smoking, because we

00:00:49.826 --> 00:00:54.310
though it was a interesting form of addiction. In some ways, it's a pure

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.654
addition. It's, it's unencumbered by the kind of social and physiological

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:04.331
consequences you have with severe alcoholism, for instance. Or, or heroine

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:10.728
addiction or cocaine addiction. Yet it's, it's the most pernicious form of

00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:17.743
addiction that we have worldwide. And people who are dependent on tobacco, you

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:23.650
can ask them. It's, it's not an easy drug to, to quit. So we've, we've mounted

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.910
a, a pilot study. We've enrolled about 15 people to date, and the results look

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:34.033
very promising. We don't have a control group, but the results we're seeing to

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:37.939
date is that the great majority of our people are entirely abstinence from

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.684
cigarette smoking. So, how does this work? What? How does it, one single

00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:47.908
session or, in this case, two or three sessions with psilocybin get people to

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:53.714
quit smoking? Well, it's embedded, this psilocybin session is embedded in the

00:01:53.714 --> 00:02:00.318
context of a cognitive behavioral therapy for cigarette smoking cessation. So

00:02:00.318 --> 00:02:04.980
prior to the psilocybin session, people learn about cognitive behavioral

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.642
approaches for smoking, they end up charting the number of cigarettes they

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:14.526
take, they rate their urges, their cravings, they note the situation under

00:02:14.526 --> 00:02:19.188
which they smoke, they look at the reflexive and kind of habitual pattern in

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:28.785
which they reach for a cigarette. So we're introducing a level of mindfulness

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:33.510
into their cigarette smoking that then when combined with this psilocybin

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.550
session. And for reasons we don't fully understand, it really result in people

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.735
being able to walk away from their addiction. What people will very often

00:02:45.735 --> 00:02:54.909
report is a transformed relationship to smoking. Before the psilocybin session

00:02:54.909 --> 00:03:00.733
smoking it held a saliency for them that was much larger than their ability to

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:06.922
cope with. They were addicted, they knew they were addicted, they couldn't stop

00:03:06.922 --> 00:03:13.596
their cravings, they were hooked. And with the expansive form of consciousness

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:18.524
that can come about with psilocybin, and when the intentionality is brought

00:03:18.524 --> 00:03:23.452
into the session to really deeply look and heal people walk away from that

00:03:23.452 --> 00:03:32.240
session with this renewed sense of self efficacy. Realizing that their, their

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.600
autonomous beings that they can watch moods and cravings and habitual patterns

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.340
come up into their field of consciousness but they can choose not to act on it.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.942
So, it's not a magic bullet. It doesn't take away the cravings. It doesn't take

00:03:49.942 --> 00:03:55.318
away the habitual tendency to maybe want a cigarette. But they can reframe it

00:03:55.318 --> 00:04:00.544
in a way that, for many of them, seems really quite magical. It's, like, oh,

00:04:00.544 --> 00:04:05.000
you know? It's, it's like Dorothy and the, and her shoes in the Wizard of Oz.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.696
She didn't know she had been wearing them the whole time.

00:04:07.696 --> 00:04:08.384
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, right.

00:04:08.384 --> 00:04:12.826
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And, and it's that sense of efficacy that people come away with. We think,

00:04:12.826 --> 00:04:17.512
mechanistically, it might have to do with increased enhancement of executive

00:04:17.512 --> 00:04:25.900
function. That's kind of a catchphrase for a how we can organize our cognitions

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:33.530
and behaviors, you know, if in real time. So, that's what we have today. We're

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.484
ready to initiate a control clinical trial. It's a very interesting area.

00:04:39.484 --> 00:04:40.193
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It is.

00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:45.850
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And it won't be restricted of course, ultimately to nicotine. There's no reason

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.134
this couldn't be an approach for any addictive disorder, but more than that

00:04:50.134 --> 00:04:55.760
Probably any form of radical behavior change. So there, there are real

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.261
fascinating implications here.

00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:02.440
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And these are small clinical trials being conducted around the United States?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.112
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, right now, all we have is this one pilot trial, and it's an uncontrolled

00:05:07.112 --> 00:05:14.300
pilot trial at Johns Hopkins. But the results are, are so promising, that they

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.305
really call for a controlled clinical trial, and what I suspect is that once we

00:05:19.305 --> 00:05:24.156
go ahead and report this kind of work, there'll be other, probably academic

00:05:24.156 --> 00:05:32.340
sites will come in and start doing more research. But we actually need to do

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.695
the research, because these compounds have been so demonized, culturally, and

00:05:36.695 --> 00:05:42.486
within the medical and the treatment community. The first impulse is, this

00:05:42.486 --> 00:05:45.520
doesn't make any sense. It sounds crazy.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.793
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, right. Well, thank you so much, Roland Griffiths, for your time today.

00:05:48.793 --> 00:05:48.991
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah.

00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:49.953
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We really appreciate it.
