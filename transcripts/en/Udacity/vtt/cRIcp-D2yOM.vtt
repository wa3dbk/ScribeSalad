00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.170
This lecture covers the theory
of NP completeness.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.630
The idea that there are some
problems in NP, so general, and so

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.520
expressive, that they capture
all the challenges of solving

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.250
any problem in NP in polynomial time.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.370
These problems will provide important
insight into the structure of P and NP,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.080
and from the basis for
the best arguments we have, for

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.920
the attractability of many important,
real world problems.
