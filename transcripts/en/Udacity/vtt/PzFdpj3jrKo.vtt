Congratulations, you created your first workflow rule. So that events

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.870
can fire actions automatically. You've also created an approval process

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.250
to define a series of steps that require human interaction

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.530
along the way. Your app is doing some amazing things right

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.130
now. What's really cool is when you see that on

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.050
your phone. In the next lesson, we're going to take this amazing

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.730
web application that you build and do just that, put

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.120
it on a phone or a tablet. We'll see you there.
