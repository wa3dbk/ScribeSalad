00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.270
So to be able to move
between different states,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.360
we need a MediaPlayer object that is
initialized for a certain audio file.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.190
Then we can call methods on that
object to move between the states.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.510
So we created a MediaPlayer object by
calling the MediaPlayer.create method.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.940
Notice that this is
using a factory method

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.420
instead of a constructor
to create our object.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.270
If you recall from the last course,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.830
we learned about factory methods
as another way to create objects.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.176
And so for example,
to create a toast message object,

00:00:28.176 --> 00:00:32.200
we've already been using
the Toast.makeText factory method.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.310
So to clarify, when you call the static
method, you call on the class.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.120
And remember, that has to be
exact name of the Java class.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.570
Now when you call a regular method or
one that's not declared as static,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.390
you can call the method on
an object instance of the class.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.540
So this name can change depending on
the name of your object variable.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.010
To learn more details about
media playback on Android,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.840
I highly recommend Ian Lake's talk,
titled media playback the right way,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.000
that he gave at
the Big Android BBQ conference.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.120
You can find the link for it down below.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.920
In the developer documentation for

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.900
MediaPlayer, the create methods are
shown here in the public method section.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.410
So the choice to use a factory
method versus a constructor

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.650
in order to create new objects was
decided by the original developer

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.910
who wrote out this MediaPlayer code.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.780
Instead of having different constructors
on the MediaPlayer class, the developer

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.180
chose to have different create methods
that could have different sets of

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.460
parameters depending on if you want to
play an audio file included in the app,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.470
or stream that audio from another
data source like the Internet.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.050
So in our case, we use this constructor.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.300
So create and it takes in context
context, and res id of type integer.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.800
So we call this create method and
pass in its two inputs.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.600
So the current context and the resource
id for the file that we want to play,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.130
and the return value of this method
is a brand new media player object.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.870
So you may have noticed here that
the create method is a static method.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.760
Just like how static variables belong to
a class and not to individual instances,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.220
static methods are methods that
are bound to the class itself.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.800
So one neat advantage of this is
that we can call the methods without

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.910
ever making an instance of the class.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.110
Now if we return back to the media
player API guide, in the code here,

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.120
we can call the static method like this.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.410
So we can use the exact name
of the class MediaPlayer and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770
not need to use the name
of an object variable.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.170
We can use the same dot operator that
we would use on an instance, and

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.786
then follow it with the name
of the static method.

00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:31.501
So we pass in the context and
the resource identifier for

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.888
the sound file that we want to play.

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:37.600
So the MediaPlayer needs a context in
order to access shared resources on

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.820
the device and to know what
environment it's being used in.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.178
And after that, we can tell the media
player to begin playback by calling

00:02:44.178 --> 00:02:45.550
it's start method.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.790
So note that this comment here points
that there's no need to call the prepare

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.430
method explicitly because
the create method

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.000
already helps us prepare
the audio file for us.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.150
So we can call a create method and
then immediately call the start method.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.877
And after that,
we can call other MediaPlayer methods.
