The next thing I'd like you to do is add 
the same caching to the permalink pages.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Specifically the same way we did on the front page,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
display the age of the query that generated 
that page on the page somewhere.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'll give you a demo on how this works on my site.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we go to one of these posts, we can see that 
this was recorded 0 seconds ago.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
As I reload this page, 
this timer increments.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's how it should work and if I'd already 
click on a--I'd probably go to a different post

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we see that this one is 0 seconds ago.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And as I reload this page, 
this one increments as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now, in order for us to test this, we're 
probably going to submit some new posts.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'll make sure "/newpost" still works.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And my net made it so--so you have to log in as spez to submit your posts,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so you guys would quit submitting spam to my site, 
but the rest of you should make this accessible.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If we submit a new post like so,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
this redirects to the permalink page 
where we see we are 0 seconds old.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And when we go to the front page, 
we see our post here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If we scroll down, we can see how old 
our caches, which is 55 seconds,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.950
which is about how much time it 
took me to go out and ask Shawn

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.000
to stop submitting spam to my 
blog while I'm recording.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If we go back to this permalink, we 
can see that it updates accordingly.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
When you've got that working, 
submit a URL to your blog here.
