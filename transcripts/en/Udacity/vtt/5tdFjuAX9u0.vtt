00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
&gt;&gt; There should be an equal to sign here, because the mean equals the median

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.403
equals the mode. We can see that the mode occurs here, in the bin where the

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:13.871
frequency is highest. But also, you can see that the distribution is

00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:18.849
symmetrical. Therefore, the mean and the median will both occur pretty much

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.536
right in the center. This data is normally distributed.
