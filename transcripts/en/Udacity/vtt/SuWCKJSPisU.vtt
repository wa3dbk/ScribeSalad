Loren on the other hand again uses emotion focus coping. And one way she can

00:00:05.435 --> 00:00:09.822
use this technique is through reappraisal. Here, Loren looks at the situation

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:14.382
again in a new light. Being an avid scuba diver, she remembers the information

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:17.892
that her scuba instructor gave her, and that let her reappraise the stressful

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:23.594
situation. If Loren checks the tide tables, she could actually time her dive to

00:00:23.594 --> 00:00:26.780
the changing tides and have a better dive if she gets in the water an hour

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.770
before high tide. This is great news for Lauren. So, now the negative emotions

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.730
have been replaced with positive ones. Excitement for the awesome dive.
