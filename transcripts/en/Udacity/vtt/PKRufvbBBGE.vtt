00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, we got rid of the times in the successor function,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
so we've got to put them back in someplace.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm going to generalize a little bit, and instead of talking about times,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm going to talk about costs for a path.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm just thinking of maybe we might want to do some other problems

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that also have paths in them and that aren't dealing with optimizing time

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but are dealing with optimizing some type of cost.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What I want you to for me is to define this function path&lt;u&gt;cost,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which takes a path as input and returns the total cost of that path.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
That's already stored away. We don't have to compute anything new.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Because we decided that our convention for paths was it was going to be stored there.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That is, we said that a path is equal to a state followed by an action and a total cost

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
followed by another state, etc.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Here I've just said, well, if we don't have any actions there

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
or if it's the empty path, then do one thing. Otherwise do something else.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Then I also want you to find the bridge cost--bcost is the abbreviation I'll use.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's the cost of an individual action.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.000
An action in this domain is something like 2, 5, arrow to the right.

00:01:15.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I want you to figure out what's the cost of that action.
