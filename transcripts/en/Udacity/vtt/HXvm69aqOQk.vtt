00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.350
Congratulations.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.760
You now have a server updated and

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.210
configured, sitting out there on
the wild west that is the internet.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.930
Best of all, you can rest easy at night
knowing your server is safe and secure.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.930
Where you do go from here?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.590
It depends on your needs.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.200
There are a lot of different
types of servers, email servers,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.040
chat servers, web application servers.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.270
Generally, the only big
differences between each of these

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.030
is the software they have installed and
the ports that they have open.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.220
I've placed a few server set-up walk
throughs in the instructor notes below,

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.200
that should get you started.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.540
I'd encourage you to start by
setting up a web application server,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.210
installing Apache in a database
server like PostgreSQL.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.070
Good luck, have fun, and
remember, experiment.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.080
This is your own little
piece of the Internet.
