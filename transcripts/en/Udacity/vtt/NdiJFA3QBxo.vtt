00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.450
The relationship between the structure of these sentences, and

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.170
background knowledge is very intricate, and complex, and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.920
very entrusting as well. Sometimes the structure of sentences can be used to

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.030
tell stories, have only implied actions in them. Consider the sentence,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.120
John fertilized the field. Now it's hard to see fertilized mapping,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.110
into any of the primitive actions that we had here.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.700
There is an implied action here, that is not specified in the structure,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.400
the sentence here. But, it is much more meaningful in terms of

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.060
the background knowledge that we have of those primitive actions. What John

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.740
fertilized the field really means, is that John put the fertilizer on the field.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.768
Now put is something that maps in the primitive actions more easily.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.880
The response under the feature that's processing.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.830
Initially the inner agent must talk for the word, given in the sentence. And

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.263
try to map in the primitive actions. And if that fails, then the [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:53.872
agent must start thinking in terms of how to transform on the sentences,

00:00:53.872 --> 00:00:58.200
to bring out implied actions, that can more easily map the independent actions.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.360
This, again, is common sense reasoning. Through common sense reasoning,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.379
I'm interpreting that there must be implied action here,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.060
that captures the meaning of the sentence. Once I have made the implied action

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.860
here transparent. The the rest of the processing, easier. The put action,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.300
maps into the primitive action of move object, this frame is pulled out, and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.730
the rest of the slots can be filled in, like earlier.
