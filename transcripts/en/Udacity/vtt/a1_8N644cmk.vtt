00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.770
Now, you're going to
set up your cluster.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.360
Open a browser, go to the public
hosting of the server on port 8080.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.540
You can see mine here.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.560
If you can't connect check
the security rules for the server and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.110
make sure the port
eighty eighty is open.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.160
Log on with username admin and it's
pretty clear what you should do here.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.070
Launch install wizard,
name your cluster.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.190
Next, select the stack,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.470
this determines the software
versions installed on the cluster.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.030
Choose the newest one HDP2.3.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.540
This stands for
hurting works data platform.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.970
Here, you list the host names of
the computers in the cluster or

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:40.970
the internal host names.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.040
I had a copy.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.850
Copy goes into here.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.840
Upload your SSH private key and
change the user account to Ubuntu.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.020
Okay, hit register and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.710
confirm, everything should
install register just fine.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.930
You should see a big list of services
that you can install on the cluster.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.109
For now, just do HDFS, Yarn,
Zookeeper and Umbari Metrics.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.880
Now, you can choose the hosts
that the various services run on.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.010
Umbari has reasonable suggestions, but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.260
you can see here that there
is one service per computer.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.760
Instead let's move the metrics
collector to this computer, so

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
it runs with the zookeeper server.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.450
So, this is 172.31 15 30,

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.730
Metrics collector, so
let's put it there, then hit next.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.250
Now, you need to assign data nodes and
clients.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.360
Node manager here worked with Yarn to
keep track of the data node resources.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.980
Client, installs all these
clients on machines.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.140
Since these hosts are running
master components,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.330
make these three data
nodes with node managers.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.730
And next, you shouldn't need to
customize any services right now.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.560
But look around to see which options
you can change okay, and ignore this.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.830
Okay, finally you can deploy it.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.460
This might take a few minutes, so take a
break by visiting your favorite website.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.910
All right, and there we go.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:05.790
Everything is running.
