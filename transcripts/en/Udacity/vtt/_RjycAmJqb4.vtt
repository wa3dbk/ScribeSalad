00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.437
Originally, I create the list by using add. And now I want to insert an element

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:08.647
without wiping away anything. I can't just use the add method because that

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:13.334
would add it on to the end of a list and I want to put it in the middle. So

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:17.344
I'll specify the index where I want to add it. So the index I would want is

00:00:17.344 --> 00:00:21.595
two. Now I always forget whether the index or the element comes first, but

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:26.719
that's okay, I can always check. All I have to do is search for ArrayList, Java

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.424
7, go to the official documentation, and I know what method I'm looking for, so

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:36.758
I'll search, for add, and here I can see the index comes before the element. So

00:00:36.758 --> 00:00:44.592
the index I wanted was two. And I'm adding another book. And now when I run the

00:00:44.592 --> 00:00:48.684
demo it'll print The Eyre Affair, Night Watch, followed by zebras and then

00:00:48.684 --> 00:00:51.579
next, just like I asked.
