00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.344
Since we have a base of 2 over here for our exponent, we need to use a log of

00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:09.347
base 2, since that's the inverse. Now we've done this before, so I'm just going

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:14.635
to write it out for you. That gives us log base 2 of 2 to the 3t minus 2 equals

00:00:14.635 --> 00:00:20.597
log base 2 of 3. For now, I'd like us to leave the right-hand side as is. But

00:00:20.597 --> 00:00:24.815
what happens to the left-hand side if we simplify it? What belongs in this

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:25.419
space?
