00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.226
This image combining line art and
a photo was saved as a JPEG and

00:00:04.226 --> 00:00:07.381
it looks fine on a phone
at small display sizes.

00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:11.182
But on a desktop monitor,
resizing the browser window,

00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:14.360
the JPEG format begins
to show its weaknesses.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.350
With JPEG, edges can lead to artifacts.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.160
For this example, SVG for
the logo would have scaled better.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.090
Here's the same with SVG for
the logo over a JPEG of the photograph.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.170
The photo and
the logo both look good small or large.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.430
You can see those crisp edges there.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.610
Both look great.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.960
File sizes are down too.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.062
Here's the version with the logo over
the image as a, one single JPEG.

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:48.439
And here we have the version
with the SVG over the JPEG.

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:52.428
And you can see that even though
we need an extra file request,

00:00:52.428 --> 00:00:55.650
we're actually only using
about half as many bytes.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790
Take a look at these three logos.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.940
They look identical, right?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.640
But if you check with the dev tools,
you'll see that we've used three

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.350
different file formats and there's
a massive difference in file sizes.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.470
The chrome.svg there is, well,
it's about a 25th the size of the PNG.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.462
There are some good general rules for

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:22.171
improving cross-platform
image performance.

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:27.139
Use JPEG for photographic images, and
browsers such as Chrome also support

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:32.666
other formats, such as WebP, which can
deliver better compression and features.

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:37.298
WebP supports alpha transparency
animation along with lossy and

00:01:37.298 --> 00:01:39.074
lossless compression.

00:01:39.074 --> 00:01:42.544
Now, if you can, use SVG for
vector images, and

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:45.180
we'll show you how to do that later.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.128
And for vector art and
solid color graphics, such as logo and

00:01:50.128 --> 00:01:54.214
line art,
if you're unable to use SVG, use PNG.

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:57.069
And do use PNG rather than GIF.

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.829
More colors, better compression and
no licensing issues.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.889
