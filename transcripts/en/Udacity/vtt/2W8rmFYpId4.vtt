Thank you Andy and Lauren. I'm here at the location of our first event, where

00:00:04.243 --> 00:00:07.591
we're going to assess our senseletes' abilities to detect differences in

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:13.246
weight. While they finish setting up, let me explain the rules. Here, our

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.495
senseletes are going have to be asked five times to reliably compare

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:22.060
differences in weight. This will allows us to the get the difference threshold.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.820
Let's go back to the studio to get a better explanation of what we mean, by

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.540
difference threshold.
