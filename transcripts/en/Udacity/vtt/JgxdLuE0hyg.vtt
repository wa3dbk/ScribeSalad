If you got that working, you just completed the first question on homework

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.350
zero. Lucky you. You can now navigate to homework zero and do the rest right

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.790
now if you like. To do that you would use the drop down up there. Right now it

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.700
probably says lesson one objects, but that's what you'll use to move around

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.280
between lessons and homework. If you don't feel like switching to the homework

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.230
right now, that's fine. You can finish up this lesson first.
