00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.010
Now you're ready to write
your own delegates.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:03.860
The challenge up for

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.370
this lesson has three text
fields with customized behavior.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.210
A zip code text field that only allows
digits with a maximum of five digits.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.530
A dollar sign text field that
begins with the text for $0.00, and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.520
then fills in the dollar
figures as digits are added.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.010
And finally a text field that can only
be edited when this switch is set to on.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.530
Here in the first field once I get
to five digits I can't type anymore.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.360
Here in the second field the digits
fill in from right to left.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.248
And there are always two
digits beyond the decimal.

00:00:35.248 --> 00:00:39.500
By the way, don't forget that
Cmd+K toggles the keyboard.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.140
In the third field, the user has to
flip this switch in order to add text.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.420
You can see that tapping inside the
first two fields brings up the number

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.650
pad instead of the QWERTY keyboard.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.110
You can set this in the attribute
inspector in Storyboard.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.270
Actually, let's open up
the utilities pane and

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.070
take a minute to explore
the attribute inspector.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.190
This is a super convenient way to
configure UI kit view components.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.260
Here you can set your placeholder text.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.857
So you might want to to put something
like, Type your zip code here.

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:12.237
Here you can configure the clear button
like the one you saw on the Safari

00:01:12.237 --> 00:01:13.740
search bar.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.720
Here you can set capitalization.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600
If you add something
like a confirmation code,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.390
you might want all characters
to be capitalized.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.870
And here's the keyboard type, which for
the zip code we want set to number pad.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.696
And just two more tips before
you move on to the challenge.

00:01:27.696 --> 00:01:31.008
You're going to need to set
the delegates for your text fields.

00:01:31.008 --> 00:01:34.330
If you want to do this in Storyboard
remember your delegate is just

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.160
a property.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.131
So you're going to look for it in
Storyboard where you always look for

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.660
properties, in the pop-up
connections menu.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.920
And here under outlets you
can see your delegate.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.320
Also, for manipulating text
you might want to revisit

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.750
these two lines of code from
the emoji textField delegate.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.795
The end of the string
class has a method named

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:55.250
stringByReplacingCharactersInRange.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.844
It's perfect to use in
a UI text field delegate.

00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:01.604
This method is helpful when you need
to build new strings from typed input.

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:06.614
In order to use this method, Swift
strings are usually cast to NSStrings.

00:02:06.614 --> 00:02:09.704
In this case the variable newText
represents the text that will

00:02:09.704 --> 00:02:10.324
be displayed.
