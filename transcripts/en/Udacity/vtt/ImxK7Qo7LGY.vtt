00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
Now before we dive deeper into the algorithms, I want to make one important point.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.090
When you use randomness in computation, there is sometimes a danger of taking the poking around

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.910
that I mentioned in my topic before this unit a bit too literally.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.000
So some people when they see an NP complete problem or an NP hard problem

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.020
and NP complete of course being for the decision problem and NP hard for the optimization problem,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.180
just terminology means both problems are hard.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.439
And then some people would just say--oh this is NP complete and this is NP hard,

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.500
well let's just try very, very many random solutions and pick the best one,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.860
which of course works better if you have an optimization problem than a decision problem,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.160
trying many random solutions sounds easy, actually it is easy,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.890
and you trust that the solution that it produces will be good enough.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.330
Well, sometimes you have no better choice than that,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.360
but in my mind I think you're playing a dangerous game and I want to illustrate this for you.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.790
So let's say that we play a game and the rules of the game are as follows--

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.880
you bet an amount x whatever you want and then you throw a die and of course, the value

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:13.560
can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and if you throw a number between 1 and 5, I will give you back

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.410
x+30% of x, and if you throw a 6, I'll give you back 0.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.400
Now my first quiz for you and again this involves a bit probabilities should you play this game,

00:01:23.400 --> 99:59:59.000
and let's say you can play as often as you want--
