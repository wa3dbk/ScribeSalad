00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.430
In the previous examples, we were looking at our

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.900
data Age and Friend Count across the categorical variable Gender.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.110
Usually, color or shape tend to be aesthetics for

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.650
representing such changes over a categorical variable. But what if

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.890
we looked at Age and Friend Count over, say,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.760
another numerical variable? For example we might notice that since

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.670
users are likely to accumulate friends over time using Facebook

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.160
that Facebook tenure is important for predicting friend count. Tenure

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.280
or how many days since registering with Facebook is associated

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.610
with age. The first people to start using Facebook were college

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.360
students as of 2004 and 2005. I was lucky enough to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.800
be part of that group and joined the site on February

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.360
3rd, 2005. As a result, I've amassed more friends over time

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.040
and have over 1,200 of them. On the other hand, 14

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.180
year-old users, have had less time to accumulate the same number

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.708
of friends. One way to explore all four variables friend count,

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:55.890
age, gender and tenure is using a two-dimensional display

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.377
like a scatter plot. And we can bend one of

00:00:58.377 --> 00:01:01.513
the quantitative variables and compare those bends. In this

00:01:01.513 --> 00:01:04.059
case, we can group users by the year that they

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.079
joined. So let's create a new variable called year_joined

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:09.700
in our data frame. This variable is going to hold the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.780
year that our users first joined Facebook. In our next

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.670
program and exercise, you're going to create this variable, year_joined,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.990
and put it inside the data frame. You need to make

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.810
use of the variable tenure and use 2014 as the reference year.
