00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.500
So the answer, is that it will never return. And

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
the reason for this is the stopping test for the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.160
while loop is when there are any more pages to

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.255
crawl, so we're going to keep doing this as long as

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:15.920
there are pages in tocrawl. So in order to finish,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.800
we need to know that the value of tocrawl eventually

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.050
becomes empty and if we look at the test site.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.830
If you follow the walking link, which the crawler will do,

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.165
you get to this page that has a link to

00:00:28.165 --> 00:00:31.850
crawling that goes back to the index. That will keep

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.290
going, and you're going to follow the walking link again, follow

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.210
the crawling link again, following the walk, walking link, following the

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.340
crawling link back to the index. And this will continue

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.900
forever. The crawler will never finish because it will always find

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.570
a link to crawl. And the real web is full

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.010
of circular links like this. There are lots of pages that

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.180
link to each other. There are also pages that link back

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.340
to themself. So to avoid this, we need to do something

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.880
smarter. We need to make sure that we don't crawl pages

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.690
that we've already done. So we're going to have to be a little

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.890
more careful about this step. We need to add a test

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.210
to see if we already crawled this page. If we did, we

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.380
don't do anything. If we didn't already crawl it, well, then,

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.130
we need to add it to crawl, add all the links in

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.540
that page to tocrawl and keep going.
