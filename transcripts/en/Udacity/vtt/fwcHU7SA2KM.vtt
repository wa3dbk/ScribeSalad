00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.280
Now, I want to cover some basic
properties of the Harris Detector.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.050
One of the bigger questions is, can we
actually build these types of detectors,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.740
the invariant to rotation?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.325
That basically means is,
let's say, if I have one image and

00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:17.560
then I have another image, and
then this image basically,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.780
let's say I have something
like a plus sign here.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.750
I want to be able to detect
the features of this even though,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.740
in this image,
this plus sign might be rotated a bit.

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:34.875
Right.
So being able to deal with rotation

00:00:34.875 --> 00:00:38.225
invariants is an important part, because
I still want to find the same corners.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.175
I have a simple example like this,
but you can actually see that this can

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:43.715
get to be very complicated,
depending on objects.

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:46.007
And of course, I sometimes
want to be able to find objects.

00:00:46.007 --> 00:00:50.980
Even with variations across the board,
on lighting and stuff like that.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.560
So that's the next part.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.080
Can we actually also find edges if
there is variance in image intensity?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.700
So again,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.890
I might have two images, and these
could be two pairs next to each other.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.640
This one is much brighter,
and this one is much darker.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.060
We saw examples of that when we looked
at the image pairs of the toy giraffe,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.620
for example.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.350
Third part that we are actually
be invariant to is Emmet scale.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.540
What basically that means is, I have
an image and I have an object that is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.460
here and it is of this scale,
but on the second image

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.310
I have the same object but it is,
in this case, much bigger.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.360
So, how do we kind of
deal with the fact that

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.010
the same object might be occurring in an
image pair, but appear to be very large?

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.970
So, in essence,
now we need to start seeing,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.890
does the Harris Detector provide
support for these type of invariances?
