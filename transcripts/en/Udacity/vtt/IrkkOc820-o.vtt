00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.200
First of all, data in Pandas is often contained

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.770
in a structure called a dataframe. A dataframe is

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.200
a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns which can

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.576
be different types if necessary. For example types like string,

00:00:12.576 --> 00:00:17.020
int, float, and Boolean. You can think of a

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.960
dataframe as being similar to an Excel spreadsheet. We'll

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.630
talk about making dataframes in a bit. For now,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.850
here's what an example dataframe might look like. Using data

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.960
describing passengers on the Titanic, and whether or not

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.350
they survived the Titanic's tragic collision with an iceberg.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.840
Note that there are numerous columns. Name, age, fare,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.862
and survived? These columns have different data-types. There are also

00:00:40.862 --> 00:00:43.942
some Not-a-Number entries which happen when we don't specify

00:00:43.942 --> 00:00:46.130
a value. There are a bunch of cool things

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.850
we can do with this data frame. Let's jump

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.990
to the command line. Say that I had already loaded

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.860
this data into a data frame called DF. We can operate on specific

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.520
columns by calling on them as if they were keys in a dictionary. For

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.730
example, DFH and we can call on specific rows by calling a data frame objects

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.681
loc method, and passing the row index as an argument, for example, df.loc('a').
