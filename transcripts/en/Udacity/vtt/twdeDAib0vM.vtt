Local Storage is a simple
name/value pair storage mechanism

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.690
that is very easy to use and
available almost everywhere.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.610
But its API is synchronous,
meaning calls to it are completely

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.350
blocking and it can cause
significant performance problems.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.420
In addition, it's not transactional.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.150
So if you try and

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.540
do two writes at the same time you'll
end up overwriting something important.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.210
For that reason, unless you're
prototyping something, avoid it for

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.050
anything that's going to
see the light of day.
