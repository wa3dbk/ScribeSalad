00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.980
Another problem is that we
often use different words

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.100
to mean almost the same thing.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.709
You can say cat or you can say kitty.

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.761
They're not the same, but
they mean similar things.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.146
Remember that when we have things
that are similar, we really,

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:18.950
really would like to share
parameters between them.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.350
But kitty is completely
different from cat.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.510
So if we want to share
anything between them.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.770
We're going to have to learn
that they are related.

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.270
So that's a very big problem for
deep learning.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.770
We'd like to see those
important words often enough

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.430
to be able to learn
the meanings automatically.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.795
And we'd also like to learn how
words relate to each other so

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:40.710
that we can share
parameters between them.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.510
But that would mean collecting
a lot of label data.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.930
In fact, it would require
way too much label data for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.590
any task that really matters.
