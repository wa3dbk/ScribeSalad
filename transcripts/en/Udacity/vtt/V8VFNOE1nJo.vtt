00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.765
So the answer is the only thing that search depends on about crawler, is how the

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.721
index and ranks are represented. It doesn't depend on how they're created as

00:00:07.721 --> 00:00:12.010
long as they represent the web quater piece in the way search expects, search

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.862
will work correctly. It doesn't depend on how the links are extracted and we saw

00:00:15.862 --> 00:00:19.762
that we can change the crawler to use beautiful soup. We replace to get our

00:00:19.762 --> 00:00:23.122
links procedure in a way use beautiful soup, but we didn't have to change

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:27.442
anything about search when we did that. It doesn't depend in crawler on what add

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:31.075
to index does in crawler. In fact it doesn't even depend on add to index

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.760
existing, none of the names defined in crawler are visible in the search because

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.246
there's no import here. It doesn't depend on how the ranks are computed, as long

00:00:39.246 --> 00:00:42.906
as the values in this ranks object that's passed into search, correctly

00:00:42.906 --> 00:00:47.055
represents something about how popular a page is. But it does depend on this

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:50.780
one. On how the index and ranks are represented and that's a big complex

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.496
dependancy.
