00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.696
Now the lowest common denominator might of been tricky here. You want to make

00:00:05.696 --> 00:00:10.454
sure that it's n times 6 minus 3n. This is one factor in these denominators and

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:15.800
n is a completely different factor. So we want to multiply those two together to

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.230
get our LCD. For the first term we'll have 5 times 6 minus 3 n. And for the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.612
second term we'll have plus 4 times n, or positive 4 n. The right side of our

00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:30.608
equation is simply 2 n squared. Since these factors reduce to one. If we

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:35.793
distribute positive 5, and combine our like terms, we'll get 30 minus 11 n

00:00:35.793 --> 00:00:40.788
equals 2 n squared. Now that we're at this part we have a quadratic equation,

00:00:40.788 --> 00:00:45.581
since we have a 2 N squared. We want to set this equation equal to zero by

00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:51.186
moving or rearranging these two terms. If we move these terms to the right side

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:56.286
of the equation we'll get zero is equal to 2 N squared, plus 11 minus 30. This

00:00:56.286 --> 00:01:00.365
is something that we can factor and solve. So here is our equation and, to

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:05.361
factor it, we want to find the factors of negative 60 that's sum to positive 11.

00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:10.424
When we use factoring by grouping, we'll get 2n plus 15 as 1 factor. And n minus

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:15.531
2 as another. Finally, we set each factor equal to zero, and then solve the 2

00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:21.603
remaining equations. N could equal negative 15/2, or n could equal positive 2.

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:25.654
And here's where we want to be careful. We need to check for the excluded values

00:01:25.654 --> 00:01:30.032
for the original equation. We know n cannot equal zero, since this denominator

00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:34.130
would equal zero. And the fraction would be undefined. We also know that n

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.153
cannot equal 2. If n was equal to 2 both of these denominators would be zero and

00:01:39.153 --> 00:01:43.990
these two fractions would be undefined. This means that this solution is not

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.861
valid. We can only take this as our actual solution. So here's our solution set,

00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:54.653
negative 15 halves. Fantastic algebraic thinking for getting that one correct.
