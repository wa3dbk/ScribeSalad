00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.550
Up until this point,

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.670
we've focused on learners that
provide forecast price changes.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.030
We then buy or sell the stocks with the
most significant predicted price change.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.040
This approach ignores
some important issues,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.680
such as the certainty
of the price change.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.560
It also doesn't help us know when
to exit the position either.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.440
In this lesson,
we'll look at reinforcement learning.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.210
Reinforcement learners create policies

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.880
that provide specific direction
on which action to take.
