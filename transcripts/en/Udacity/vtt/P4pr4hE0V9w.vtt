00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.820
You probably agree that opt-in with
patient specified restrictions

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.100
is the most attractive
privacy consent model.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.470
But how do you actually manage it?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.129
How do patients indicate what data
they want to share or not share?

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.790
Providing a mechanism is
the data segmentation problem.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.100
Suppose for
example a patient had hypertension and

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.820
depression among their medical problems.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.810
Their hypertension is
not well controlled and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.090
they have undesirable side effects
from the drugs prescribed to treat it.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.330
So they're interested in joining
a clinical trial for a new and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.469
promising medication.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.300
As a result,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.000
they want to share the hypertension part
of their data to apply for the trial.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.330
But they are sensitive
about their depression and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.430
wish to restrict access to that data.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.305
How do they specify that?

00:00:53.305 --> 00:00:57.832
The solution is easier if someone with
clinical expertise and their trust,

00:00:57.832 --> 00:01:01.430
such as their physician,
does it for them.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.970
But suppose the patient has their
record in a PHR and wants to apply for

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.080
the trial themselves.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.250
Presented with a list of their own
medications, they may not recognize

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.810
the names or know for
sure which ones are for what condition.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.990
That form of sharing would be
greatly facilitated if their PHR or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.490
EMR understood these
clinical relationships.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.576
Here's a simple depiction of just
such a record for our hypothetical

00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:31.091
patient from Dr. Jonathan Nebeker at
the University of Utah in the Utah VA.

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:35.193
Given this underlying
representation of relationships,

00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:38.802
the patients could simply
click on hypertension and

00:01:38.802 --> 00:01:42.739
see the related medications
with the others greyed out,

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:48.495
greatly facilitating the opt-in with
patient-specified restrictions model.
