00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.820
Let's discuss the solution for our performance

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.767
reporting quiz. We need to check, among these,

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.897
all of those that use codes from real

00:00:07.897 --> 00:00:11.100
applications, but not all of the code. Peak

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.980
performance doesn't use any code. Synthetic benchmarks do

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.550
not use code from real applications. This is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.480
code specifically designed for testing. Application kernels do

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.890
use code from real applications but that application

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.070
code has been reduced to form a kernel,

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.940
so this is definitely true. An application suite

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.500
uses the code from real applications and uses

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.676
all of the code for these applications. So,

00:00:37.676 --> 00:00:41.052
this is not true. And then, an actual

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:44.492
workload mix is similar to an application suite

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:47.588
except that it comes from usage patterns of

00:00:47.588 --> 00:00:51.139
a specific user. So, the answer to this quiz

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:53.344
is that application kernels use code from

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.750
reapplication, but not all of their code.
