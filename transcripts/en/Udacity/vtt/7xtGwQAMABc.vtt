00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.080
So let's down define what does it
mean for caches to be coherent.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.310
Intuitively, they're coherent when the
whole thing behaves like there was no

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.220
caches.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.620
But let's define more precisely
what exactly does it mean.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.780
There are three requirements for
coherence.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.170
The first one says that the read,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.910
let's call that read R,
from some address X on some core C1 will

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.430
return the value written by the most
recent write, let's call that write W,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:37.320
to the same location, and
that write was on the same core C1,

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.470
if no other core has written to that
location between the accesses w and r.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.560
So this first part of
the coherence definition

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.180
really says that if one core is
operating on a location alone,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.450
then its reads should be getting the
most recent writes from the same core.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.820
This basically says that a coherent
behavior includes correct

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.610
unit processor behavior as long as the
location is accessed by only one core.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.680
The second part of the definition
says that, if core C1 writes

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.180
to our location X, and
C2 reads X after a sufficient time,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.450
and if there are no other writes that
happen in between C1's write and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.750
C2's read, then C2's read must
return the value C1 wrote.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.980
So pretty much, if there is a write and

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.930
the read happens sufficiently after that
write, then the read has to read what

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.300
the write wrote, except if there
was another write in between,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.400
in which case the read is allowed to
return that value instead of this one.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.420
So this part of the definition
really prevents the case when,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.480
for example,
C1 writes something to its own cache,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.350
C2 reads forever from
its cache a stale value.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.030
To be coherent, if C1 writes,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.400
then after some sufficient time,
C2 must start reading the new value,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.639
even if maybe a normal cache with no
coherent support would just keep reading

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.500
the stale value because
it never gets replaced.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.150
So we have to do something in order to
make this part of the finishing work for

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.950
private caches, that the caching
data in a coherent system.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.424
So we must do something to make
this caches behave this way.

00:02:27.424 --> 00:02:31.900
And finally, the third part of the
definition says that if there is more

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.320
then one write to the same location,
then these writes must be serialized.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.900
That is any two writes
to the same location

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.330
must be seen to occur in
the same order on all the cores.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.010
What this part of the definition really
says different cores should not be able

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.590
to disagree about which write occurred
first and which occurred second.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.490
Note that second part of the definition
doesn't really require this to happen.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.480
Let's say there was one write on C1 and
another write on C3.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.100
When C2 reads, it's allowed to return
after a sufficient time either C1's or

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.330
C3's value, because it's
allowed to interpret this order

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.600
as either C1 and then C3 wrote,
or the other way around.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.810
What this part of the definition says
is that whatever C2 sees, if C2,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.730
for example, sees that final
value is that from C1 and

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.710
not from C3, then all the other cores,

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.180
when they're in their location after C2,
need to also see that order.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.610
So, it cannot happen that
C2 thinks C1 wrote last.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.980
Some other core, sometime later,
reads and still sees C3's value.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.760
So, what this is really
saying is that everybody,

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.960
including the writing cores,
will see the value that

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.930
is consistent with there being some
particular order to the writes.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.330
It doesn't require any particular order.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.700
For example, the writes can happen
almost simultaneously, in which case,

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.480
we are free to choose which happened
first and which happened second.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.490
But we cannot allow some
cores to think that

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:21.209
one write was first and other cores
think that another write was first.
