00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.249
Our interval would be from negative 4 to positive 2. x could actually equal

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:10.530
negative 4 and positive 2 in this case, and any value in between them. Great

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.236
solving if you found this interval. To begin solving this inequality, we

00:00:14.236 --> 00:00:18.800
want to subtract 8 from both sides. This allows us to set this quadratic

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.000
expression less than or equal to 0. Now, we can rewrite this as an equation and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.780
find the 0s or the x values that make this equal to 0. We factor the quadratic

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.599
expression, and then we set each factor equal to 0 to get x could equal

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:38.772
negative 4 or x could equal positive 2. We use these to create the three

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:42.740
separate intervals on our number line. Next, we want to test a value in each of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.578
the intervals. For the first interval, we'll test the value x equals negative

00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:52.116
5. So plugging in the value of negative 5 in for x, we'll get the statement 7

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:57.574
is less than or equal to 0. Now, this of course, isn't true, so this interval

00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:02.113
is false. It's not part of our solution. For the second interval, we can test x

00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:06.603
equal 0. If x equals 0, we lose these two terms and we're left with negative 8

00:01:06.603 --> 00:01:12.190
is less than or equal to 0. This, we know is true, so this part is included in

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.721
our answer. And finally, for the third interval, if we test x is equal to 3,

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:22.106
we'll get the statement 7 is less than or equal to 0. Again, we know this isn't

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:27.718
true, so this region is out. So the values of x that satisfy our inequality are

00:01:27.718 --> 00:01:32.149
between negative 4 and 2. We include negative 4 and 2, since we have the or

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.170
equal to symbol here. Since we know both of these values are 0s to the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.224
quadratic equation. I hope you're starting to see all sorts of patterns when

00:01:40.224 --> 00:01:42.060
you solve these types of problems.
