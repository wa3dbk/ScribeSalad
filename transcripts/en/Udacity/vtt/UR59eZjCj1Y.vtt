00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
If the orbit of the spacecraft is not closed even though it has to be in the model,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we've got some problem with implementations, so that's a verification issue.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The maximum carrying capacity was a model parameter for the fish model,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so in this case the calibration was done right.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the other one is a prediction of the model doesn't work out well, so that's a validation issue.
