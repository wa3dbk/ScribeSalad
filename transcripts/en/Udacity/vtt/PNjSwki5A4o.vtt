00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's move on a little bit.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We now know how to make basic requests with urlLib.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You guys are going to become very friendly with that module.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'd like to talk a little bit now is what we actually send over the wire between two computers.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We could have our servers--in this case we'll use the Hipmunk example.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We could have our servers make our request to Amtrak

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and receive HTML back from them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then we can actually look into that HTML on Hipmunk servers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
That's actually what we do, but this is suboptimal.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let me show you why. You've written some HTML at this point.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You know that it's somewhat complex.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's not very regular.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You've got things like--browsers are very forgiving.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can write HTML to look something like this where you have an opening tag,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and you have an opening <b>tag to make some text bold,</b>

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and you can forget to put the closing tag, put your closing tag,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the browser will actually probably render it appropriately. At least some browsers will.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If you were a computer trying to parse this, you're expecting a <b>tag to have a</b> tag.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
All of a sudden you can get lost in this loop.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Depending on how complicated you want to make your parser,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
maybe you can recover from this like browsers do or maybe not.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But HTML is not an ideal language for computer-to-computer communication.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It turns on Amtrak, we actually get their HTML, and I'm going to show you some

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
of the heartache we have to go through to actually parse this HTML.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Remember I gave you some regular expressions during homework 2

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to verify your quiz answers--to verify a username and an email.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
These are a bunch of regular expressions that we actually use on Hipmunk

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to parse Amtrak's HTML.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
As you can see, this is just a wall of text.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is extremely error-prone,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and you can see like we're actually looking for div with class availability.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We're going to look for the span whose ID is service_span.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This is what a time looks like. This is really nutso.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
This is not the ideal way of doing things.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In a perfect world, we wouldn't have to hit Amtrak's webpage.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We would instead use an API that speaks a language more appropriate for this task.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Suck a language, if language is the correct word, might be XML.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
XML is what actually invented in the late '90s specifically for this purpose--

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
to have a regular way of expression data between computer systems.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I can't claim to be the biggest fan of XML, but it is fairly easy to parse.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
In fact, you've seen a lot of it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So this is what some XML might look like.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
If you're thinking this looks an awful lot like HTML, you are correct.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We have our first line, which is basically the document type.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We have the same thing in HTML.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Remember we've been using HTML5, so our doc type looks something like this.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's just the first sign that says what format the rest of the document is.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, the reason both HTML and XML have doc types and this tag structure

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is because they actually share a common ancestor in SGML,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which was invented in the '80s.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Now, the main difference between XML and HTML is in XML every tag

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
has to have a closing tag.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We've got opening , closing .

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The tag format is the same.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We've still got out less thans and our greater thans and our slashes to indicate a closing tag.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But we have no void tags in XML.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Remember in HTML we could have the tag for putting in a line break,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and we never had a closing tag.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That's because HTML doesn't require all tags to close.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We have this notion of a void tag. The line break was an example of one of those.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's just a opening tag. XML has nothing like that .

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, if you want a tag that has no content in XML,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
you could do something like this.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You could include a closing slash before you're greater than symbol.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
In fact, there is actually a doc type for HMTL called "XHTML,"

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
which basically says my HTML document is actually going to be valid XML.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Instead of doing void tags with no closing slash,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
you include the closing slash before the greater than.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You'll see that a lot in XML.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The whole point of what I'm trying to say is that XML is very similar to HTML,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but it's more rigorous. It's similar because they share the same ancestor.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Now, I'm not going to spend a whole lot more time on the structure of XML,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
because we spent so much time on HTML already.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.297
Just keep in mind that it's similar to HTML, but a little bit more consistent.
