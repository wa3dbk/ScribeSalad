Tap targets should be bigger
than the average finger.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.130
So, to ensure that all of your
elements are at least that size,

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.720
add min width 48 pixels, and min height
48 pixels, to every tappable element.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.720
Simply using width and height,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.020
alone can be a little dangerous,
because it won't allow the element to

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.130
resize if the content inside of
it is bigger than the container.
