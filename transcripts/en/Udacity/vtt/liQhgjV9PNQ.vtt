00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.029
Let's first rewrite the factors within this term, so that the factors of the

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:08.224
same bases are next to each other. And I'm also going to put the constant factor

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:12.353
first. So I'm going to start with 3 squared, then we have 2 factors that have a

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:16.854
base of x. So I'll put those next to each other, and then the last thing we have

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:21.211
is the y cubed. Well, we know that 3 squared is just 3 times 3, and 3 times 3 is

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:25.456
just 9. We also know that when we have x to the 5th times x to the 8th, that's

00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:29.651
the same as x to the 5 plus 8 power, and nothing is being involved with the y

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:34.289
cubed, so it's just going to stay the same. You'll notice I got bit of those

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.944
multiplication signs between the different factors in the term. Since they are

00:00:38.956 --> 00:00:43.219
implied, we just don't write them. Now, the thing you need to simplify here is

00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:47.414
add together the two numbers in the exponent of the x. So you get the final

00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:52.138
answer of 9x to the 13, y to the 3rd. I think that you're going to find all of

00:00:52.382 --> 00:00:56.574
this practice with manipulating exponents really useful, as we keep simplifying

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:57.574
expressions.
