While we're working with some images, what does this code do? It rotates the

00:00:05.536 --> 00:00:09.984
image 180 degrees. It replaces the bottom half of the image with a rotation of

00:00:09.984 --> 00:00:14.770
the top half. It has no effect or it crashes and throws an exception. This

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.800
question is hard. We don't expect you to get it right the first time.
