00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, the next thing I'd like you to do

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is implement this function called build link index.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
What this is going to do is it's going to iterate over the list of links we have,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and it's going to return a dictionary

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that maps a links ID as an integer

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to the link itself.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So just return that dictionary.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
All right, good luck.
