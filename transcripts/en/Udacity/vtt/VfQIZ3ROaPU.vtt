00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.556
The left hand side is equal to the log base b of j times a times m. Remember

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:11.029
when we add two logs with the same base, we can really just multiply these two

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:17.454
numbers together. So we can simplify these first two logarithms to be the log

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:23.778
of base b of j times a. Now we apply this rule one more time, and we multiply j

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:30.376
times a by m. So we'll just have one logarithm, log of base b, of j times a

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:36.809
times m. This is how we know this left-hand side is equal to this right-hand

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.620
side. I use quotes here just to represent the same expression written here and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.790
here.
