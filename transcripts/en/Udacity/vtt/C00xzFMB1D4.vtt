00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.220
Now that you've seen all
the parts of a function,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.745
let's put those pieces together.

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:07.210
We'll write a few function definitions
together and then call those functions.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.250
We'll start with a description of the
task the function should accomplish, and

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.180
go from there.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.960
Here's one you may have seen before.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.860
Write a function that
takes in the string and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.300
returns the first
character of that string.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.364
Again we start with the func,
and then we need a name.

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:24.040
I'm going to call this
one firstCharacterOf.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.030
I'll add my parentheses and
my curly braces.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.410
In general,
don't shy away from long names,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.240
especially in the age of code
completion, it's more important to be

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.980
descriptive than it is to save
yourself a few milliseconds of typing.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.160
It also would have been fine to call
this function firstCharacter, but

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.840
I want to emphasize that the naming
convention in Objective C in Swift

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.720
is to use prepositions and function
names to refer to the first parameter.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.460
In this case, a string.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.780
Here this function is returning
the first character of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.910
the string being passed in.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.390
So we have our name.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.160
Next comes the parameter
between parentheses.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.900
Let's call the string we're
going to pass in, word.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.650
That'll be its local parameter name.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.620
And then we specify its type, string.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.000
And next comes an arrow and
the return type.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.463
Our return type in this case
is going to be character.

00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:19.431
And I'm just going to write return "x"
here so that we can quiet that error for

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:20.310
the time being.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.130
And finally we get to
the meat of the function.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.000
In between curly braces here we'll put
the statements we want to execute.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.448
There are a number of ways to get the
first character of a string in Swift.

00:01:31.448 --> 00:01:35.480
I'm going to use subscript syntax
with the index start index.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.820
And of course once we get that value,
we want to return it.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.115
Okay, now it's time to call it.

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:43.810
firstCharacterOf is a global function,
so in order to call it,

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.510
we just write its name and then pass
in a parameter between parentheses.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.860
And over here in the sidebar,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.680
we can see that the first character
of Mom is being returned.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.670
Now, notice that we didn't give
our parameter an external name,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.220
we only gave it the local name, word.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.060
Thus when we called it, we just
passed it in the parameter itself.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.702
Let's go ahead and
add an external name to our parameter.

00:02:06.702 --> 00:02:10.360
It's kind of hard to come up
with another word for word, so

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.416
I'm just going to use word again.

00:02:11.416 --> 00:02:14.720
And now that we've specified
an external parameter name,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.310
we need to use that external
parameter name in the function call.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.540
Now you've probably noticed that the
compiler is complaining about something.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.540
Let's see what it has to say.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.290
Word word can be expressed
more succinctly as #word.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.100
It wants us to use the shortcut for

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.900
external parameter names that
are the same as local parameter names.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.450
If we just place a hash mark in front
of the local parameter name, we let

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.270
the compiler know that the external and
the local parameter names are the same.
