00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So the answer is always y, and this is why this is such a useful function

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in cryptography--if we XOR in the value of x twice, they cancel out.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So the general property for any value x--x XOR x-- is equal to 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We can see that from the truth table.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The value of x could either be 0--and 0 XOR 0 is 0--or 1, and the value of 1 XOR 1 is 0,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that means that x XOR x is always 0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:39.000
XOR is also associative and commutative, so that means if we have x XOR y XOR x

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that's equivalent to x XOR x XOR y which is also equivalent to y.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I've written this using x's and y's--if we change the names of our letters to M and C

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it becomes really clear why this is useful in cryptography.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If we call x the key, then we have the key XOR the message--that's going to be the ciphertext--

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and then the ciphertext XOR the key again gives us back the message.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And what I've described is exactly the One-Time Pad.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The key aspect is--why it's called One-Time--is that we can only use the key once.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So if we do this one bit at a time, we need a new key for each bit.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
If we think of doing it for a longer message, well then we need a key long enough

00:01:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that we're XORing each bit with one bit of the key.
