00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.056
And we said there are a couple of other
aspects to a privacy policy other than

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:09.895
collection, use, and sharing, which
is how hard do they work to address

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.253
the security of that information?

00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:16.530
Many of it's services actually
use extra TPS or use encryption.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.760
I mentioned that they do
stronger authentication,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.317
they do two factor authentication now,
password, and

00:00:22.317 --> 00:00:27.090
then they send you, on your phone,
they send you a code that you use.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.700
And they use other safeguards,
we talked about a lot of their technical

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.610
safeguards who are protecting
information or securing information.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.180
So they do all these things so the
private information that they have about

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.450
you doesn't get into the hands
of malicious actors.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.680
They do have something
about changing the privacy,

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.458
all these things we were talking about.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:55.890
If they want to change any aspect of
these, they will not change them and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.190
change in a waywhere that reduces
your rights without your consent.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.110
So the idea is the privacy policy says,
well,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.240
if we ever want to go to a more
lax privacy policy, okay,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.010
which is what reducing your rights is,
we would ask you, okay?

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.410
And only if you consent to that,
we will change the policy.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.921
And so it's a way that you can view
it as more lax than what they had

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:19.845
before, okay?

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:24.079
So repeating the policy says
what we collect, how we use it,

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.735
how we share it, how we secure it, and

00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:31.790
if anything changes about the policy
what would it take to do that.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.978
Okay, so that's sort of a quick,

00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:37.800
brief overview of what a privacy
policy should look like.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.910
We use this example, Google,
but you can go study somebody

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.570
else's privacy policy and
see what aspects of the things

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.370
that we discussed here are covered in
that policy and what is not covered.
