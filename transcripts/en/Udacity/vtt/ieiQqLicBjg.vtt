00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.400
There are a ton of observations to make here, and you

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.460
might have said something about a particular spike in the graph,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.450
or spoken more generally about the trends. Here's what I noticed,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.890
I noticed that the vertical scale had changed, since the blue line

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.370
goes all the way down to the bottom. This means that

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.810
the number of times that we see music or movies in

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.770
headlines is much greater than the number of times we see

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.860
the word chicken. I also noticed that music used to be more

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.300
prevalent in headlines, but it's declined in recent

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.034
years. In fact, the word movies overtook the word

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:36.110
music for headline presence around June 2010. That

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.290
might not have been obvious on the static image.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.500
But if you played with the interactive visualization,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.160
you could find dates and other interesting things too.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.090
If you notice something else that isn't covered

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.100
in the solution video, share it on the forum.
