00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.258
The number that belongs here is 23. So, how did I figure that out? Well, one way

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.416
to check if the solution is correct is by writing this equation, and then

00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:15.724
substituting in values for d and for n, and seeing if they match our table. We

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:21.040
know that,= after 3 days, for example, 69 wiper sets have been produced. So,

00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:26.438
that means that if we take d and we replace it with 3, we should get that n

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.788
equals 69. And sure enough, 23 times 3 is 69. That checks off their table. So,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.165
we can see that our equation fits the situation that we were trying to make it

00:00:36.177 --> 00:00:40.135
fit. You could do a similar thing with any of the other sets of entries on this

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:44.050
table. When you plug in a number for d, you should end up with a corresponding

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:48.025
number for n when you simplify. But checking if a solution is correct is pretty

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:52.030
different from creating the solution yourself. So, how did we come up with these

00:00:52.042 --> 00:00:56.120
mathematical descriptions, these equations on our own? That's what the next few

00:00:56.132 --> 00:00:57.455
lessons are going to be about.
