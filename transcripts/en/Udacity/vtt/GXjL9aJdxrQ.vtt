00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.870
So here's one last helpful loop, the for in loop.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.650
For in loops let us easily iterate through arrays or objects.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.670
The syntax looks like this.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.510
The same keyword for.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.080
We have some kind of iterator, which we can give any name that we want.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.900
Then we have the keyword in, and then an object or

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.680
array that we want to iterate through.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.380
For each of the items in some object, we want to do something.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.060
Just like before, we put the conditions for our for loop inside parentheses and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.640
the statements we want to execute inside curly braces.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.780
It's important to note here that this item,

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.270
this iterator in this list is actually the index of the item in the object,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.700
not the value held at the index in the object.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.832
So let's take a look at an example.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.752
We have an array called countries,

00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.702
which has the top four teams of the 2014 World Cup.

00:00:45.702 --> 00:00:48.750
We have a for in loop here, which is going to iterate for

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.210
each country in the countries array, we want to log that country.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.830
Hey, James.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.780
Do you see anything wrong with this code?

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.140
&gt;&gt; It's just going to print out, zero through three and

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.570
not the actual country name.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.260
&gt;&gt; Why is that?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560
&gt;&gt; Because country is an iterator in countries.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.070
It's not the actual value of country.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.660
&gt;&gt; That's right, so let's make a change.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.800
Instead we should have console.log countries of the index country.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.250
Let's see if this is correct.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.190
So, here's our for in loop in one line of code.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.370
By using Shift + Enter, we can actually put this in a much nicer format.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.990
So we see, for (country in countries) { console.log(countries[country]) }; and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.980
I'm pressing Enter.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.370
We see Germany, Argentina, Brazil, and The Netherlands.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.110
&gt;&gt; You should already have a work object with all of your work experiences.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.700
I want you to write a for-in loop that iterates over all the jobs in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.640
your work object and appends them in a new HTMLworkStart element.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.220
I want you to also format each job's employer with HTMLworkEmployer in

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.550
each job title with HTMLworkTitle and append all of that to the page.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.710
