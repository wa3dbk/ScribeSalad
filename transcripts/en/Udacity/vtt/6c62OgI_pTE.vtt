Now, I'd like to talk about a different error. I've on purpose made that error

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.860
over here. So have a look at the code and tell me what you think is the

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.550
problem. Is the code so bad that it won't compile? Or will the code run with

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.460
some errors? Or is the code just inefficient? Maybe gas consumed should be an

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.740
instance variable? Or is it inefficient in a different way? Maybe miles driven

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.970
should be a local variable. Okay, have a look, and if you like you can try it

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.465
out in BlueJ.
