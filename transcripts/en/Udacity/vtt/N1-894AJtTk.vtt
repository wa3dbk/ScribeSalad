00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
And the three correct answers are faster clocks.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.917
This corresponds to our more productive digger.

00:00:04.917 --> 00:00:09.346
More work per clock cycle—this corresponds to our super shovel.

00:00:09.346 --> 00:00:12.750
And more processors—this corresponds to hiring more diggers.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.318
And this is the approach that we'll be taking in this class.
