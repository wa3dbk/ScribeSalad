00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.070
These two lines are going to intersect. For the first equation, I just need to

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:10.033
subtract 2x from both sides. And I get 1y is equal to negative 2x plus 3. For

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:14.869
the second equation, I need to add 20 to both sides to isolate the 10y. So I

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.952
have 5x plus 20 is equal to 10y. Finally, I divide each term by 10 and I get 1y

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:24.581
is equal to the 2 plus 1 half x. I'm going to rewrite this equation flipped

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:29.287
over, the y's in the left, and 1 half x plus 2 is on the right. When I look at

00:00:29.287 --> 00:00:34.087
the two equations, I notice that their slopes are different so they must

00:00:34.087 --> 00:00:34.950
intersect.
