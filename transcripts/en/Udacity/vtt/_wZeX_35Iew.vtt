00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.950
Here is an awful picture.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.750
But, its picture comes from the paper
and I'll show you what we're doing.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.458
So this is our original picture.

00:00:07.458 --> 00:00:09.200
I equal G0.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.470
And in Laplacian pyramid,
the zero level is the finest level.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.400
And that way, you always have the zero
level, and one would be filtered down

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.310
once, level two is filtered
a second time, level three.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.140
And you can filter as many
times as you want to, up to n.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.830
For n being some big number.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.370
Okay, but the idea is you start at zero.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.510
Sometimes people don't like that.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.630
They typically want the,
the zero to be this most compact one.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.347
But that doesn't make any sense.

00:00:33.347 --> 00:00:35.400
because really smart guy.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.515
He wouldn't do that.
You start with your original image of

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.630
zero and then you,
you keep filtering it down.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.434
All right.

00:00:41.434 --> 00:00:43.760
So, that's our original image.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.800
The first thing we have
is this reduce operator.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.461
Okay?

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:50.623
And we're going to go over
these in some detail, but

00:00:50.623 --> 00:00:53.939
the reduce operator
essentially takes a Gaussian,

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:58.930
that's the convolution signal,
blurs it, and then this down arrow?

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.450
Down arrow here means down sampling.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.660
So just taking every other pixel.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.700
That would give you level one,
do it again,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.080
you would get level two,
etc., etc., etc.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.730
That one's sort of straightforward.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.950
And like I said, we'll go
through the numbers in a minute.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.790
The one that's a little less
clear is the expand operator.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.660
Remember we have to expand these things
up so if I expand up the coursed one and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.380
then I subtract that from G1,
that gives me L1.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.940
That gives me the first Laplacian,
all right?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.480
The expand operator is a little less
intuitive than the reduce operator.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.460
Let me show you what they are.
