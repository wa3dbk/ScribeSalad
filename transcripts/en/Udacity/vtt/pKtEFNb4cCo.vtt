00:00:00.261 --> 00:00:03.698
When the list item is clicked, 
use Android's Toast mechanism

00:00:03.718 --> 00:00:05.698
to display the weather forecast string.

00:00:05.917 --> 00:00:09.741
A Toast is a pop-up that displays 
a message for a few seconds

00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:11.185
before fading out.

00:00:11.193 --> 00:00:14.262
It's particularly useful for debugging,
where it can be used as a way

00:00:14.262 --> 00:00:18.025
to indicate status visually 
without altering the app UI.

00:00:18.195 --> 00:00:19.819
We're going to put our list view,

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.553
set item click listener 
into forecast fragment

00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:26.300
inside of the onCreateView method.

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:34.238
We'll just start typing 
listView.setOnItemClickListener

00:00:34.782 --> 00:00:36.888
and let the auto complete 
fill in the rest.

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:41.749
Inside of this function, 
we're going to add click listener,

00:00:42.493 --> 00:00:44.381
which we can instantiate in place.

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.963
Here's where we can call the code
in Android to display the Toast.

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:51.340
Now that you know 
where to place the Toast code,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.807
take a look at the Toast documentation.

00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:58.008
Add a Toast when the list item is clicked
that contains the weather information.

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:02.016
Hint. You can get the forecast 
by getting an item

00:01:02.016 --> 00:01:04.503
from the forecast adapter, 
at the position given

00:01:04.503 --> 00:01:06.253
by the OnItemClickListener.
