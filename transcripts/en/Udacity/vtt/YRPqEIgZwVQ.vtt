00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:04.145
We're going to start by looking at how
to convert just one clause from CNF to

00:00:04.145 --> 00:00:04.738
3-CNF.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:08.440
This is going to be the heart of
the argument because we're going to

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.460
be able to apply this procedure to each
clause of the formula independently.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.340
So consider this one clause
consisting of literals Z1 through ZK.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.530
We're going to have three cases
depending on the number of

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.579
literals in each clause.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.080
Note that I have left off K equals
3 since nothing needs to be done in

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.270
that case.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.990
When there are two
literals in the clause,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320
the situation is easier to understand.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.490
We just need to boost up
the number of literals to three.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.270
To do this we include
a single extra variable and

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.180
trade in the clause z1 or
z2 for these two clauses here.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.750
One with the literal y1, and
one with the literal y1 nod.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.113
If in a truth assignment,
z1 or z2 is satisfied,

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:51.550
then clearly both these have to be true.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.130
On the other hand, taking a satisfying
assignment from these clauses here,

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.040
the Y literal has to be false
in one of these two clauses.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.480
And so therefore z1 or z2 must be true.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.070
We can play the same trick
when there's just one literal,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.450
z1 in the original clauses.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.040
This time we need to introduce two new
variables which we'll call y1 and y2.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.360
Then we replace the original
clause with these four.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.880
Note that if z1 is true, then all four
of these clauses are true as well.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.795
On the other hand, for any given
truth assignment for z1, y1 and

00:01:29.795 --> 00:01:34.800
y2, that satisfies these four clauses,
the y literals

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.020
have to both be false in one of these
and that then implies that z1 is true.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.480
Lastly we have the case where
K is greater than three.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.290
Here we introduce K minus
three variables and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.100
use them to break up the clauses
according to this pattern.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.610
Let's illustrate this
idea with an example.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.600
Consider this sixth literal clause here.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.580
Looking at this, we might wish that
we could have a single variable

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.210
that captured whether any of these
first four literals were true.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.745
Let's call this variable y3.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.836
Then we can express this overall clause
with just three of the literals,

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:12.501
y3, or z5 or z6.

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:18.520
At first I said that we wanted y3 to
be equal to z1 or z2 or z3 or z4.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.720
But actually it's efficient and
considerably less trouble for

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.350
y3 just to imply the truth
of one of those literals.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.370
This idea is easy to
express as a clause.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.900
Either y3 is false, in which case
the implication doesn't apply, or

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.290
one of z1 through z4 better be true.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.835
Together, these two clauses
imply the first one.

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:46.165
If y3 is true,
then y3 bar is false, and so

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:51.670
one of the z1 through z4 must be true,
and so must the original clause.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.800
On the other hand,
if y3 is false, then z5 or

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.690
z6 must be true, and so
must the original clause.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.050
Also, if the original
clause is satisfied,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.120
then we can set Y3 equal to
the disjunction of z1 through z4,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.550
and these two clauses will
be satisfied as well.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.660
Note that we went from having
a longest clause length of six

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.400
to having one of length 5 and
another of length 3.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.870
We can apply this strategy again
to the clause that's too long,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.810
by introducing another variable y2.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.128
And trade this long clause in for
a shorter clause,

00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.121
this time one of length 4 and
one of length 3.

00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.110
Of course we can play this trick again.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.930
And eventually we have just three
literal clauses, this example is for

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.940
k equals 6 but an inductive argument
will show that the argument works for

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.754
any k greater than 3.
