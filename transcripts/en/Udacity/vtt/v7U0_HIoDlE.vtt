00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here, we test your knowledge of Java script environments and scope

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
along with a little bit of info on Native North American peoples.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
As the text of the problem suggests, we're going to solve it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by working out the nested environment diagrams.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's start with the global environment.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In the global environment, we define a function Apache,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the first thing we do is call it with the inputs 9 and 10.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So this is going to create a new environment for that function call of Apache.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The inputs were 9, which corresponds to Iroquois.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And the second was 10, which corresponds to Ottawa.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We then set Seneca to 1 and we declare and set Creek to 2.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
When we print out Seneca, we're going to look at the lowest environment, which is Apache.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We see Seneca as 1. Iroquois is 9. Ottawa is 10.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We now declare a function Cherokee, and we call it with the inputs 777 and 888.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Since we're going into a new function, we create a new environment.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
777 gets assigned to Seneca, which is a local variable, and Creek gets a value of 888.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We print out Seneca, which at the closest scope is 777.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We then print out Iroquois. It's not in the scope of Cherokee.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So we go up to Apache and Iroquois is defined as 9.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We now print out Ottawa. Ottawa is not defined here in Cherokee but it's defined in Apache as 10.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And lastly, we're going to print out Creek. Same deal. Not defined in Cherokee but is in Apache.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now we do some modifications. We set Seneca to 33. We set Creek to 44.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We set Iroquois to 55. It's not in Cherokee.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So we're changing the value of Iroquois in the Apache environment.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Then we set Ottawa. We leave this function and now we're printing out Seneca.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Since we've left the Cherokee function, this environment no longer applies.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And we're simply looking at what's in Apache. The value of Seneca is 1.

00:02:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
The value of Iroquois if 55. The value of Ottawa is 66. The value of Creek is 2.
