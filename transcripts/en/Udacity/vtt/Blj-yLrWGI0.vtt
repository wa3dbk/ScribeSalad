00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.719
Now that users can log in to my system,

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:05.860
I should make a way to protect
the resources they can access.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.570
For this example, let's assume there's
a resource exposed by this API that

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.730
needs to be available
only to registered users.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.350
This resource is accessed at
the end point /protected_resource.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.570
To protect this resource,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.884
I'm going to use an extension
in Flask called Flask-HTTPAuth.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.230
Flask httpauth is a simple
extension that provides basic and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.930
digest http authentication for
Flask routes.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.740
With Flask httpauth,

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.205
an end point is protected by adding
the auth.login_requried decerator to it.

00:00:37.205 --> 00:00:41.300
Flask.httpauth needs to be
given some more information,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.650
to know how to validate
user credentials,

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.200
which is implemented through
the verify password call back.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.120
It is given a username and password and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.920
returns true if the combination
is valid and false if not.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.130
Flask HTTP off invokes
this callback function

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.600
whenever it needs to validate
a username and password pair.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.540
This function simply finds
the user by their username,

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.900
verifies the password using
the verify password method.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.640
And if the credentials are valid,
then the user has stored it in

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.110
FLASK's G object, so
that the view function can use it.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.630
Let's send a request to my server now,
and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.330
first see what happens if I use
an incorrect username or password.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.680
I can't access the resource.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.630
But using the correct username and

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.900
password, my request gets
the protected resource for the user.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.170

the code implemented in this video.
