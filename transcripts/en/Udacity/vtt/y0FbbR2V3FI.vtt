00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.250
That was a good incremental step. Now, let's add back the parts

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.370
that make this into a real credit card verifying program. I'm going to

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.030
ask you to write one more Java program. And this time, I'd

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.110
like you to use this pseudocode. There's a tester program you can use

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.250
for guidance. And here's a hint. Credit card numbers are too big

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.090
for ints. This problem is tricky. There are a lot of ways

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.130
to write code that almost works, but not quite. It will be

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.340
very important to use the tester

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.500
program. You can also use System.out.println statements

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.150
to get an idea of what your program is doing. There will be more

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.140
hint videos. Try to use the ones that match the questions in your mind.
