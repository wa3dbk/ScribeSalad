I'm actually making the table, because here at Udacity we have a micro-kitchen

00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.048
where we keep shared snacks. And I want to find out where all of the cookies

00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:10.978
are going. So I'm compiling data and I want to print it out in a table, like

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:15.970
this. Can you complete the code in MicroKitchenTable? To print out this table,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.682
a couple quick hints, this vertical bar character on an American keyboard is

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:25.208
right below the Delete key, right here. You'll need to hold down Shift to make

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:30.483
it work. Also, make sure to print a row for me and a row for Cay. I've started

00:00:30.483 --> 00:00:35.155
you off with some variables for cookies per day, cereal boxes per day for Sara

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:37.302
and for Cay.
