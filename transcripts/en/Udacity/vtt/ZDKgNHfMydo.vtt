00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.460
One possibility for increasing the initial compromise rate,

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.060
or designing a very fast spreading worm, is

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.400
to create a hit list, or a list of vulnerable hosts ahead of time. That curve

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.400
we just saw shows that the time to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.130
infect the first 10,000 hosts dominates infection time.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.400
So if we start by performing stealthy scans

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.320
or some reconnaissance to construct a list of

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.200
vulnerable hosts before we start spreading, then

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.780
we can get rid of that initial flat

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.810
part of the curve where the worm is

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.200
effectively dormant. The second approach is to use

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.200
something called permutation scanning Where every compromised

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.360
host has a shared permutation of an IP

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.270
address list to scan for vulnerabilities. Now if

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.350
this list is randomly permuted and a particular

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.220
host starts scanning from its own IP address in the list And works down,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.870
then different effected hosts will start scanning

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.090
from different parts of this list ensuring

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.860
that compromised hosts don't duplicate each other's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.390
work. One worm that exploited these techniques

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.680
to spread particularly quickly was the Slammer

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.250
worm, which spread in January of 2003.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.880
Exploiting a buffer overflow in Microsoft's SQL

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.610
sever. In addition to using fast scanning techniques,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.990
the entire slammer code fit in a single small UDP packet. The UDP packet contain

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.500
the worm binary, followed by an overflow

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.660
pointer back to itself. It would say classic

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.940
buffer overflow combined with random scanning. Once

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.300
the control is passed to the worm code,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.520
it randomly generated IP addresses and attempted to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.490
send a copy of itself to Port 1434

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.170
on other hosts. One brilliant aspect of the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.070
slammer worm, is that because it was spread

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.350
by via single UDP packet, it was connectionless,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830
meaning that it could spread. And was no

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.030
longer limited by the latency of network round

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.300
trip time, but only by the bandwidth of

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.310
the network, the worm caused $1.2

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.300
billion dollars in damage, and temporarily knocked

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.970
out many elements of critical infrastructue, including

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.940
Bank of America's ATM network. An entire

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.450
cell phone network in South Korea, and five route DNS servers, as well as

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.030
Continental Airlines' ticket processing software. The worm

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.930
actually did not have a malicious payload,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.610
but the bandwidth exhaustion on the network caused resource exhaustion on

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.270
all the infected machines. Here's a picture of the hosts around

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:46.390
the world that Slammer infected. This damage was inflicted in just

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.410
thirty minutes, due to the very lightweight nature in which Slammer spread.
