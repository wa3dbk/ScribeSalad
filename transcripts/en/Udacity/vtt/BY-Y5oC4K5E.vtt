00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer is Marcie.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To answer this question, we first want to look at the number of degrees of each node.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A degree is the number of edges coming in and out.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Tyrone is a node with degree 2.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Marcie a node with degree 3.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Sayo is a node with degree 2.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Christian is a node with degree 2.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Javier, our starting node, is a node with degree 3.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Hubert is a node with degree 2.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As we showed in lecture, in order for there to be an Eulerian path

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
every node in the network needs to have even degree,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
except for the starting and ending nodes, which are odd.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In this example, Javier was our starting node and it had degree 3.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
All the other nodes are even, except for Marcie, which has degree 3,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
which is odd. Marcie will be our end node.
