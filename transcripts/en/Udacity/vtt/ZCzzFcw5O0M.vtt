Before we get to our next word problem, let's learn about perimeter. You might

00:00:03.922 --> 00:00:07.816
already know what this word means, but if you don't, I'm sure you'll be able to

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:11.643
figure it out. For example, for this triangle, I know that the perimeter is 15

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:15.674
centimeters. For this rectangle, I have sides of 2 units in length, and a width

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:19.956
of w. I don't know the width. The expression for this perimeter is 4 plus 2 w.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:24.102
And I don't know the units for this perimeter, so I'm going to write the word

00:00:24.114 --> 00:00:28.273
units. It could be meters, centimers, or even inches. So, what do you think

00:00:28.285 --> 00:00:32.649
perimeter means? Try and find the expressions for the perimeters for these two

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.278
shapes. You can write your answers in the boxes.
