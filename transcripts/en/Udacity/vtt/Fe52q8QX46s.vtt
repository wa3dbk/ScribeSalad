00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Like I said in the problem, I'm going to show you a fairly naive brute-force solution to this

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that is definitely vulnerable to some things.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
First of, we start up with the check Sudoku function from the first problem.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Exact same function as the base for solving this real board.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
After that solve Sudoku is actually fairly short if not exactly pretty or copy in sys here

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and copy is the only needed here, sys is used down below

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
for something that is entirely for testing purposes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
First we check the grid then check Sudoku

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and if check Sudoku returns none or false, we returned the result.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
You could also assert here, I wanted to be able to continue on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
for testing purposes so I just return the result instead of asserting that,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
although asserting would definitely be a good idea here as well

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we used deep copy to copy this over

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and not going to get into what exactly the copy package and deep copy is.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Surprise to say that we made a copy of the initial input into another.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Now, we check through the grid for zero elements

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and we change them to each of 1 through 9 and then recursively call solve Sudoku on the results.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This is a very very slow brute-force process but its also fairly easy to call that as well.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Each element in the grid, which I put zero and then for all and in the range 1 through 10

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:02.000
so all elements 1 through 9 then we set that grid position to that number

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and then we call solve Sudoku again.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
If this new grid isn't false, then we return it.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Otherwise, we backtrack and that it's it. It's all there is too bad. It's really pretty simple.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
There are a lot of ways you could really really mess with this if you wanted it to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
take a very very long time for instance and right here break it into forms.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Just to check real quick, let's check that my solution actually works.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and this is for all of the inputs that we gave as example test cases.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.000
You can see that it does verify that the first two,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the L form and the invalid ones didn't work and then for the valid one and easy,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we didn't do ALG simply because it would take this out

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
on a little bit longer to do that and I didn't want to wait

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
so that it shows that the valid and already solved board is the exactly the same

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and the easy board is filled out with a valid Sudoku board solution.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I hope you enjoyed that and I hope you looking at everyone else's code

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and seeing how everyone thought about the problem and how you might think

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
about testing the problem itself.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I hope you had a lot of fun with that. See you in the next unit.
