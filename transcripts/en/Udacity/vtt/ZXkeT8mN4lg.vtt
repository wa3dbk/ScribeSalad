00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.505
In the first time slot, you can pick writing, statistics, or psychology. So you

00:00:04.505 --> 00:00:08.558
have three options. Let's say you pick writing. Then you can either do

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:13.510
statistics or psychology. So you have two options. Let's say you do psychology.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.256
This last one is forced. You only have one more option, statistics. You had a

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:23.736
choice in two of the time slots, the first and the second. You could have done

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:28.185
statistics first, then you can choose between writing and psychology. Or you

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:31.902
could do writing first and then choose between statistics and psychology,

00:00:31.902 --> 00:00:36.704
etcetera. But once you choose your first two, the last one is forced.

00:00:36.704 --> 00:00:41.613
Therefore, in this simple situation, there are two degrees of freedom.
