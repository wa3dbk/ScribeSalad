00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.260
Let's discuss typical
firewall configuration.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.430
First, let's provide some background.

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.690
Most standard applications that run
on top of TCP follow a kind and

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.970
server model.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.760
For example, for
a simple mail transfer protocol or

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.700
SMTP, email is transmitted from
a kind system to a server system.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.760
The client system generates new email
messages, typically from user input.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.128
The server system accepts
incoming email messages, and

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:30.802
places them in appropriate
user mailboxes.

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:36.105
SMTP operates by setting up a TCP
connection between client and server, in

00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:42.098
which the TCP server port number, which
identifies the SMTP server, is port 25.

00:00:42.098 --> 00:00:49.248
The TCP port number for the SMTP client
is a number between 1,024 and 65,535.

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:55.140
&gt;From this example, the port numbers
less than 1,024 are so called

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.750
well known port numbers and are assigned
permanently to particular applications.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.319
Such as port 25 for
server SMTP or port 80 for HTTP.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:10.070
The port numbers between 1,024 and
65,535 are generated dynamically and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.140
have temporary significance only for

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.720
the duration of a TCP connection
from a client to the server.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.800
Therefore, a packet filtering firewall
must permit inbound network traffic on

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.280
all these high number ports
vorticity base connections.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.360
For the so-called,
well-known ports that are below 1,024,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.720
there are protocols that use
the entire range of ports.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.920
And in such case, the entire range
must be allowed in order for

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.910
the protocol to work.
