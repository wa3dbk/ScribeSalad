In this lesson, we'll discuss the reorder buffer,

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.650
which let's us correctly handle exceptions and branch mispredictions in out of

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:12.000
order processors. This is very important for actually making real programs work.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.379
So, all high performance processors today, include such a reorder buffer.
