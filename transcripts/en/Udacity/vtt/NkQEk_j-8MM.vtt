00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.346
This one here is the correct answer. Let's see why. The first two can't be

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:08.818
right, because we're multiplying with a decimal number here. And then when we

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:13.335
divide, we're not going to get an integer. We're going to get some fractional

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:19.302
number, 0.0 and a little bit, 0.9 maybe at this end, and so on. But that's not

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:22.490
what we want. We wanted to reduce these, this range of integers to that range

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.290
of integers. So it's gotta be one of these two, and now the question is do we

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.258
divide by 256 or do we divide by 255? And it doesn't seem like it would matter

00:00:33.258 --> 00:00:37.482
much, but it really does, namely if value happens to be the very last element,

00:00:37.482 --> 00:00:44.155
if it happens to be 255. Then this equation wouldn't work, 255 times 6, again,

00:00:44.155 --> 00:00:48.943
divided by 255 would be 6, and we're only supposed to get values between 0 and

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:55.466
5. All right, here we have the formula, and now it's time to put it to work in

00:00:55.466 --> 00:00:57.149
Java.
