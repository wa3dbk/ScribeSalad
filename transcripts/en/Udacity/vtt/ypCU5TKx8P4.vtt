00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Bonus, bonus.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
What if we want to return all the sublists

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in one big list instead of printing them out?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, let's try something like this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Instead of printing out what we've selected so far,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I will return it, and then down here when I make my 2 recursive calls,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I'll make a list of the first one and add it to the list of the second one

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and see how that works, and to make it a little easier to evaluate the answer,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we'll go back down to just 2 people, so we know there should be 4 options.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
When we stare at it a bit, this looks pretty good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Here's the answer with both of them.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here's one. Here's the other, and here's no one.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But let's check and make sure that it's actually coming out equally.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If it's coming out equally, I should be able to get these 4 elements

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
out of the list independently, the 4 answers.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Uh-oh. That didn't work.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We can see that we haven't been building this up into

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
sort of an evenly balanced list.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
There are too many opening square brackets here,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
not enough in other places.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I could try returning this as a singleton list,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but it doesn't make us any happier.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But here, if I return the base case as a singleton list

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and then concatenate these 2 lists together,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I get the 4 separate parts of the answers I was expecting.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Just to review that, I'm going to go back to the wrong world.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Here's the wrong world where in the leaf case

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I just returned the list of people selected so far.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And then in the recursive case, I make a list of that and concatenate it with the list of the other.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
That actually doesn't work out.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What I really want instead is to return a singleton list

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
at every leaf and then just gather them up.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They may seem very similar, but if the depth of the tree

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is more than 1, if this is a long tree that might have 8 things at the bottom,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
the wrong way ends up adding too many sort of nested levels of listing.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This way adds exactly the right amount.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Here let's just print out our answer.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Now we can see that it's a list of 4 elements,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
both of them, just one, just the other, none of them,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and if I add in Susan B. Anthony, a list of 8 elements.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Nicely done.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You followed along, got some practice with a brute-force procedure

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to enumerate all the sublists of a list

00:01:59.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and a little more experience with debugging.
