00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.506
So now let's look at the whole schematic of a simple charge couple device.

00:00:08.376 --> 00:00:12.295
Here I'm basically showing an animation of each and

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:15.390
every layer of a charge couple device.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.680
We are going to basically now peel this back out as an onion, and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.070
look at each one of them separately.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.810
But of course,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.310
point is, light is coming down this way and hitting a variety of layers.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.480
And then, of course, it hits the bottom layer,

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.000
where actually the current is stored.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.130
Let's again, look at this by peeling the onion layer by layer.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.980
So the first layer basically has a little bit of an optical flavor.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.930
It's what is referred to as a micro lens.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.960
What in essence it does, it captures the light and

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.800
directs it towards the light sensitive areas beneath it.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.846
So when light hits these types of things,

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:59.960
it focuses it down to the next layer so then nothing is lost.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.580
The next layer is referred to as the hot mirror.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.140
This is where some of the simple filtering is done.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.540
So in the case of the film, this saw the example of a UV filter.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.070
Well this is somewhat similar.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.440
Basically it let's visible light pass, but

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.430
reflects light in the invisible spectrum.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.598
And basically doesn't pre, it prevents it from hitting the sensors below.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:26.740
So this simple sort of filtering and prevents the unnecessary light to hit.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.650
Of course, different types of cameras would do different things.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.790
So for example, if you wanted to build a UV camera,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.450
this would not be filtering out the UV light.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.830
In fact it would be amplifying it.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.500
This is what's referred to as a color filter.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.580
Remember light has lots of constituent colors.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.650
Most of the time we try to represent them or

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.170
at least capture them in RGB format.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.770
And that's what we're going to try to understand how to do here.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.970
So in essence, the photo diodes that are below it are actually color blind.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.550
They basically want to capture the intensity.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.670
So this is where we kind of start now looking at and separating out the colors.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.910
This is usually referred to as a Bayer Array.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.100
And we'll talk about Bayer Arrays in a bit.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.270
Basically what it does, it takes a color and separates the light into red,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.970
green, and blue.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.420
And, once it's been ordered into red, green, and blue it hits

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.280
the photo diodes that are below which are then measured the intensity of it.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.210
Of course, this pattern is unique and knowing this pattern is

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.656
essential because it'll tell us how to be able to convert the value from,

00:02:29.656 --> 00:02:31.730
in this case, two greens, red and

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.880
a blue to figure out what would the value at this point of the image.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.300
So as noted, these are the photo diodes.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.890
This is exactly where the light energy that now actually is hitting each one of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.720
these, is converted to electrons and carries a strong negative charge.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.930
The final layer is the Well, or sometimes referred to as the depletion layer.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.700
This is where electrons are collected and usually there is a processor that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.600
charges the photo diodes with a positive charge, and then of course all

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.270
the negative charges basically are stored and collected on this layer.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.140
So in essence, when you're pressing a shutter,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.210
what you're doing is of course opening the shutter.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.690
And also giving a charge to this device so

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.940
that can it capture all of these stuff.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.900
In case of a chemical film, all you need to do is open the shutter and

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.350
that's when exactly the storage happens.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.280
And of course, when the storage happens, you move the film across.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.150
In this one, all of the stored, captured off, and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.370
we'll talk about that in a bit, too.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.030
So in essence, we peeled this whole onion and

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.130
we saw all the details of how light goes all the way and then ends up

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.490
as a stored electrical set of values which are then converted to pixels.
