00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.782
&gt;&gt; You see this in a situation where you may have a 4000 pixel by 4000 pixel

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:08.044
texture that may be fetched from a server. This single fetch can take about 241

00:00:08.044 --> 00:00:12.654
milliseconds to download, which is actually pretty fast. If you were actually to

00:00:12.654 --> 00:00:17.670
chop up that image into smaller little pixels, so, for example, we would create

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.458
4,000 separate images, the total load time to request all of those images to

00:00:22.458 --> 00:00:27.456
occupy the same amount of space would change drastically. In fact, it would

00:00:27.456 --> 00:00:32.759
actually increase from 241 milliseconds to 4.3 seconds, that's an increase of 17

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.787
times. With this in mind, it makes sense then that in order to reduce load times

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:42.638
for high performance web applications, we should group as many of the small

00:00:42.638 --> 00:00:47.977
elements together into one large image to reduce the number HTTP requests. This

00:00:47.977 --> 00:00:52.552
process of packing smaller images into larger images is known as texture

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:57.232
atlasing and is a very well-studied process in most games. For example, in

00:00:57.232 --> 00:01:02.182
real-time graphics, a texture atlas is a single large image that contains many

00:01:02.182 --> 00:01:06.560
smaller sub-images, each of which can be referenced independently.
