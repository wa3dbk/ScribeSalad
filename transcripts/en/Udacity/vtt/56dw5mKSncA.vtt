00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.272
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I just chose one of our two possible equations in point-slope form to see

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:08.712
what we end up within slope-intercept form. We should get the same answer

00:00:08.712 --> 00:00:13.689
regardless of which of these versions of the point-slope form equation we used.

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:18.122
Either way, in the end, we get y equals negative 5 over 4x plus 51 over 4.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.245
Remembering, of course, that 4 is equal to 16 over 4.
