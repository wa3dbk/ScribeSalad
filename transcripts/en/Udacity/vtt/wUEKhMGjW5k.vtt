00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.590
Now that you know how to create
an arbitrarily complex nested layout,

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.330
it's important to understand
that they don't come for free.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.655
Once again, the resource constraints 
of the platform spoil the party.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:14.951
Inflating complex layouts 
can be expensive,

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:19.427
potentially impacting the performance 
and responsiveness of your app.

00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:22.135
So there are two good 
rules of thumb to help.

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:27.790
First, keep your layout shallow and wide, 
rather than deep and narrow.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.820
That means you're better off
with more siblings and fewer children.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.000
Because it's never as simple as that, 
you also want to avoid

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.820
having excessive Views.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.953
In the most general terms, 
that means your activities'

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:43.466
full hierarchy should never have 
more than ten nested Views

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:46.110
or over 80 Views in total.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.590
That probably sounds like a lot, 
but let's open up

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.350
the Hierarchy Viewer tool
in Android Studio

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.470
and see just how quickly
that can add up.
