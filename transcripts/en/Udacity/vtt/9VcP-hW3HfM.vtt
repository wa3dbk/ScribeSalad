00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.210
If you've got these numbers for your scientific notations, and a positive 2 as

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.690
your exponent, great work. These two numbers are large numbers, so they'll need

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.736
positive exponents for the power of 10. And these numbers are less than 1,

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:16.767
they're small, so they'll need negative exponents. Now I'm going to work with

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:20.958
the powers of 10 down here to simplify them. When we multiply the same bases, we

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:26.137
add the exponents. So we'll have 10 to the third, divided by 10 to the 1. And

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:30.956
next, we divide the bases of 10, so we subtract the exponents, giving us 10

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:31.633
squared.
