00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:06.900
You'll see that in every systems research paper, there is heavy lifting to be

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.450
done to take a concept to implementation.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.080
Working out the details and ensuring that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.952
all the corner cases are covered is

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:20.230
a non-trivial intellectual exercise in building distributed

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.850
subsystems. Like this one, the global memory

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.920
system. What is enduring in a research

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.170
exercise like this one? The concept of

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.390
paging across the network is an interesting

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.730
thought experiment, but it may not be

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.290
feasible exactly for the environment in which the

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.090
authors carried out this research, namely workstation

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.310
clusters connected by a local area network. Each

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.150
workstation in that setting is a private

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.030
resource owned by an individual who may or

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.590
may not want to share his resources,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.350
memory in particular. On the other hand, data

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.450
centers today are powered by large scale

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.170
clusters on the order of thousands of processes

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.930
connected by a local area network. No

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.900
node is individually owned in that setting. Could

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.220
this idea of paging across the local

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.130
area network be feasible in that setting? Perhaps.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
Even beyond the thought experiment itself what is perhaps more enduring

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.100
are the techniques, distributed data structures

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.080
and the algorithms, for taking the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.520
concept of implementation. In the next part of this lesson module,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.040
we will see another thought experiment to put cluster memory to use.
