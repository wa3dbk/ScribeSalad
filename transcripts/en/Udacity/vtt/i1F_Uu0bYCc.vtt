00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.090
What did we just do when we determined that the running time of algorithm B grows much faster

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.620
than the running time of algorithm A.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.810
Well first of all we said that there was some value of n.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:18.000
So some value for the size of the input where this running time function

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.800
is always larger than this running time function.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.710
So the running time of algorithm A is some function f(n) and the running time of algorithm B

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.750
is some function g(n).

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:42.080
So if g(n) grows faster than f(n) then there must be some value of n for which g(n) is larger than f(n).

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.110
And for any value larger than that, this must also be true and we are going to call that value n‘.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.570
And for that value n‘, we must have that g(n‘) is larger than f(n‘)

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.110
because we're saying that g(n) grows faster than f(n)

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.660
and of course this must hold true for all values larger than n‘

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.160
So we have a second condition here that for any value larger than n‘,

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.610
we must also satisfy this condition here.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.410
Now we also said that we do not want to care about constants.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:18.040
So we do not want to care about if this here says 3n² or 5n².

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.420
We would just say that this function basically grows depending on n².

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.150
So in order to do that, we need another number in here and that number is a constant

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.110
that would allow us to scale the function g(n) and

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.310
I'm soon going to give you a few example to show what that means exactly.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.110
But in general it means that if we can multiply this function here with some number,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.310
let's call that constant c,

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.410
so that it outgrows f(n) then we would be still be satisfied.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:55.630
Then we would still say that g(n) grows at least as fast as f(n).

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.240
And this is all you need to know to understand big O notation

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.710
because if those two conditions here are satisfied

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:11.740
so there are some numbers n‘ and c so that c&lt;i&gt;g(n‘)≥f(n‘) so there's some point where&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.370
this function gets at least as large as this function and from any point onwards,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.450
this function continues to be at least at large then we would say that f(n) is contained in O(g(n)).

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.990
So the big O means that g(n) is a function that grows at least as fast as f(n)

00:02:32.990 --> 99:59:59.000
and this is the O that gives big O notation its name.
