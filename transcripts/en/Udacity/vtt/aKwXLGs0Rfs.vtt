00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.590
Another design component that can aid you in your work when creating

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.720
visualizations is color.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.540
This bar chart displays the count of certain cuts of diamonds, and

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.500
it was made using the R programming language.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.300
I'd like you to take a few minutes to think about how color is used

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.570
in this chart.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.270
Do the colors add to the visualization or

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.790
do they distract from the visualization?

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.160
Come up with a few reasons for yourself.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.490
Once you're ready, check this box and submit the answer to continue.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.130
Keep in mind that you don't need to submit an answer here.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.180
I just want you to think about those question for a minute.
