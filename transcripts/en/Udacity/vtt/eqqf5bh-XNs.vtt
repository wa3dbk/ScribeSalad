00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.265
Although so far we've only substituted in numbers in place of our independent

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:10.640
variables, we can really substitute in pretty much anything we want. Now, you

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.605
know that my favorite letter in the entire world is m. So, I'd like you this

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:20.240
time to set x equal to m, and use that in our function. What is f of m?
