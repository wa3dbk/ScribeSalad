00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.570
Here's the answer; we can define hashtable_get_bucket, and

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.280
it takes two inputs, the hash table, we'll

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.110
call that htable, and the key, which is

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.960
the word we're looking for. And to find the

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.290
bucket, well, we're going to use hash_string. We're going to

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.600
pass in the same word, the keyword, that's the

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.180
input key. The number of buckets is the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.650
length of this table, so we're going to call hash_string,

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.500
passing in the key. And as the second input, we need

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.690
the length of the table, that's the number of buckets. So

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.710
that will get us a number which is the index of

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.880
the bucket we want. To get that bucket, we need to

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.590
use that as the index to select that element from htable,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.840
and then we want to return the results. So that's all

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.930
we need to find the bucket. Let's look at that in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.900
the Python interpreter. So here's the code we have so far.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.590
We have the hash string procedure we defined that maps

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.410
the key word and a number of buckets to the position

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.130
where that should occur in the hash table. We have

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.650
the make_hashtable procedure that creates an empty table with that number

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.100
of buckets. And now we have the hashtable_get_bucket procedure that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.300
takes a hash table and a key. And give this the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.120
element of the hash table which is where that key would

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.310
belong using that hash string function to find the right position.
