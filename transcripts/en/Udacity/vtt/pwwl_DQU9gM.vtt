00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, time for a quiz, and in this quiz

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to ask you to write a function,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and what I'm going to ask you to do is to define the function called deal,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which will deal out some hands so that we can actually play some poker.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you should give this deal function the number of hands

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that you want dealt, the number of players,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we'll optionally allow you to define

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the number of cards in each hand.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For regular poker that will be 5, but there's other games

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where you deal out 7 or other numbers of cards.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We want to allow for that too to make the deal function

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a little bit more general.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Your task is to define the function with that signature

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that would return a list of numhands different poker hands.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Each one has n cards, and I'll give you a hint

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that you should look at the Python module

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
called "random" and look up to see if there's something there

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that can help you shuffle the cards, so what deal will do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
is take a deck, shuffle it, and then deal out those hands

00:01:04.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and return the value of those hands.
