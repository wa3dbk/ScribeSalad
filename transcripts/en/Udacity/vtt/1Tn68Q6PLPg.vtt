00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.890
In looking through
the UI View Controller record category,

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.090
you may have noticed a method
called convert video to GIF.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.500
This is where the magic happens.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.400
Let's see here.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.950
It's using a class called regift.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.210
What's that?

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.710
Regift was written as
a Cocoapod by Matthew Palmer.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.360
And it does exactly what we need.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.130
It converts a video into a GIF.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.190
If you look into the GIF
maker objective C folder,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.020
you'll see a folder
called third party code.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.180
If you open up that folder,
you'll see another folder called Regift,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.370
that's where we've included
the files directly in the project.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.050
We've also added these files
to the swift project template.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.290
Here's Matthew Palmer's read me for
regift on GitHub.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.980
And in the Quick Start guidelines, we
can see that to initialize an instance

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
of the regift class,
we need to pass in four parameters.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.430
The video URL, the frame count,
delay time, and loop count.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.520
Go back into your swift project and
add frame count, delay time, and

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.150
loop count at the top of the UI View
Controller extension file as constants.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.220
We'll start with these defaults for
now but

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.650
you can experiment with different
values to suit your liking.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.640
Next we'll add a method
called convertVideoToGIF

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.800
which uses the regift class.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.370
In this method will create
an instance of the class regift.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.000
In the read me,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.380
we can see that this line of code
initializes an instance of regift.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.910
The method that creates the GIF
is named appropriately createGIF

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.660
if we open up the regift.swiftFile.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.990
We can see they create gift returns
in NSURL to the newly created GIF.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.610
So go ahead and create a variable called
GIFURL to store the return value and

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.570
now that in theory we
have a URL to a GIF.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.960
Let's test it out by displaying
it in the GIF editor.
