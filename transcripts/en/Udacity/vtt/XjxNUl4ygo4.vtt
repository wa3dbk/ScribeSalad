00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
Worst-case running time gives us guarantees and also it sounds like it's a very big simplification,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.460
but the thing is as long as we're still counting the number of time steps of the algorithm exactly

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.380
even worst-case running time can get pretty tricky and I'll give you one example for this.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.190
Again, we're going to consider an algorithm that takes as input a string of length n.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.080
What this algorithm does is given the string of length n, it counts the number of times

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.010
that the sequence ab appears in that string.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:41.920
So it will iterate over the length of the string and if it finds an a, it will look if the next character is a b

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.530
and if that is the case, it will increase the counter here.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.780
What I would like you to consider for our next quiz is what a worst case and a bust case input

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.840
for that algorithm would look like.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.430
Here we have the number of potential inputs and it doesn't really matter how long those inputs are.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.590
It's more about their structure and if the structure would cause the algorithm to behave

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.510
as it would in the worst case or in the best case or something else,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.830
and what I would like you to do is for each of those strings, tell me if that string will cause the algorithm

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.820
to go into a worst-case running time, a best-case running time, or something else.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.830
For each of those four strings, I would like you to tell me if those strings caused the algorithm

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.260
to have the best possible running time or the worst possible running time or something in between,

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.740
and it doesn't really matter how long those strings are.

00:01:35.740 --> 99:59:59.000
It's the structure that I want you to look at.
