00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.072
The answer is sometimes. When sample sizes are equal, in other words, there

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:11.438
could be five values in each sample, or n values in each sample. The grand mean

00:00:11.438 --> 00:00:16.787
is the same as the mean of sample means. Since there's an equal weight to each

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:22.262
sample in calculating the grand mean. However, when sample sizes are unequal.

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:26.227
We have to find the grand mean by adding all the values from each sample and

00:00:26.227 --> 00:00:32.125
dividing by the total number of values, the sum of the sample sizes. When

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:37.941
sample sizes are equal. The grand mean is the same as the mean of sample means.

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:42.836
Since there is an equal weight to each sample. And this is the same as the

00:00:42.836 --> 00:00:48.039
means of all values. Where capital N is the total number of values in all the

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.229
samples. But when the sample sizes are unequal. We can't use the mean of sample

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.003
means. We have to add all the values in all the samples and divide by the total

00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:04.316
number, the sum of the sample sizes. But in this lesson we'll only work with

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:09.669
samples of the same size, so it's fine to use the mean of means. Here's a quick

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:15.072
explanation in symbols, if you're interested. Let's say we have three samples.

00:01:15.072 --> 00:01:20.601
X, Y, and Z. The mean of X is X bar. The sum of each value, divided by the

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:26.748
number in that sample. The mean of Y is the sum of all the values in Y, divided

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:33.749
by the number in Y. And likewise for sample Z. We want to know if the mean of

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:39.330
means. Equals the total mean, the sum of all the values in x, y, and z, divided

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.690
by the total number in each sample. Well, we know that because the mean of x is

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.220
the sum of the x values divided by the total number. That the sum of x is just

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.840
x bar times the number. So we can replace that in each of these. The sum of the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.623
x i's equals the average times the number in x. The sum of the y values, is the

00:02:06.623 --> 00:02:12.792
average of y times the number, et cetera. Well these are not the same if the

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:18.517
number in each sample is different. But if there is the same number in each

00:02:18.517 --> 00:02:24.236
sample, let's just call it n. Then we can rewrite this as n times the sum of

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:30.032
the sample means divided by 3n. The ends cancel out and then you get the same

00:02:30.032 --> 00:02:34.952
thing. So, that's why if the sample sizes are the same, which they will be

00:02:34.952 --> 00:02:41.145
throughout this lesson, we can just use the mean of means. But, just remember,

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:46.247
for later in lesson 13, we'll work with different sample sizes. So to calculate

00:02:46.247 --> 00:02:50.151
our grand mean we'll have to add all the values and then divide by the total

00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:52.517
number of values.
