00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's a code that's pretty simple.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
All we do is we iterate the variable F over all the possible values of filling in the formula.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If we say that filled-in formula F is valid, then we should go ahead and return it.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Otherwise, when we get through the end of the loop, we automatically return None.
