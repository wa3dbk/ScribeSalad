00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.460
I'd like to now take a few moments to talk about how

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.620
to be a good ciziten on the Internet. There are two key

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.510
things you can do, when you’re writing programs to manipulate other peoples

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.870
websites, or to access other peoples websites, that will make everybody's life a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.230
lot easier. One is, use a good user agent. Remember, we talked

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.910
about, in unit one, user agents are the header that describe what,

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.890
what browser you are using, or what program you are using to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.080
access somebody. If you are planning

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.340
on accessing somebody in a consistent fashion.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.818
If you're going to polll them, you know, every couple of seconds for

00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:32.130
updates or do something like that, use a good user-agent. When you're using

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.455
urllib2 you can specify headers in your request, and you should set a

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:40.830
user-agent header that says, you know, who you are, what your name is, maybe

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.600
links to your website. So that somebody on the other end, if they

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.590
see you, you know, pounding them with lots and lots of requests, they

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.620
know, they know what's up. They have a way of reaching you to

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.350
ask you to stop or to tell you they blocked you or that sort

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.150
of thing. It's good to always include that. And the other important thing is,

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.450
is to rate-limit yourself. If you want to download, let's say, all of the

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.710
search results for the word udacity on Twitter, yeah, you can, you can request

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.870
them 15 at a time, which is what their API returns, I believe. As fast

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.680
as you can, but you'd be really sending a lot of requests to Twitter

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.510
because you can have some loop and it's much, much faster than any human

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.870
could type it and that will actually hurt Twitter's service. If you were to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.450
have code like this in Python, you

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.430
know, while there's more stuff, make another request

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.790
to Twitter, and just run this and this infinite loop, or maybe

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.000
not infinite loop, but loop that's going to run through a number of

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.240
iterations, you'd be sending requests as fast as Twitter could possibly serve

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.420
them. Instead it's a really good to get in the habit of using

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.830
the sleep function. In Python you can say import time, time.sleep(1). And

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.490
this will cause your interpreter to sleep for one second. And this

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.680
is nice. Then you're only hitting them once a second, which is

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.450
much more sustainable. But, if you abuse their service, or do too many

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.390
requests, they'll probably rate-limit you. I

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.210
know Twitter does. Because I thought about

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.966
having a quiz in this, in this unit that was, how many requests

00:01:47.966 --> 00:01:51.790
in a minute can you make before Twitter rate-limits you? But then I

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.310
realized that that would be the exact opposite of being a good citizen

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.730
on the net, asking thousands of students to go hit some website as

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.500
fast as you can. It's generally not a nice thing to do. So,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.820
instead, we're just going to talk about it. I'm going to ask you

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.510
to make sure, if you're hitting somebody hard, that you structure your code

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.810
like this. Include a sleep so you pause

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.830
a little bit and don't hit anybody too hard.
