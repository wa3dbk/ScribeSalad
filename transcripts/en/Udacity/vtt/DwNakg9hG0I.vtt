00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.072
Let's start with this first number line. The first shaded region down here

00:00:04.072 --> 00:00:08.232
starts all the way out at negative infinity, and comes up through negative 9,

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:12.532
including negative 9. So we have negative infinity to negative 9 united with

00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.782
negative 6, which is not included up through positive infinity. Written as a

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:21.003
compound inequality, this should be read as y is less than or equal to 9 or y is

00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:25.812
greater than negative 6. Of course, noting that our variable here is y as shown

00:00:25.812 --> 00:00:30.712
at the edge of the number line. For the second number line, our interval goes

00:00:30.712 --> 00:00:35.767
from negative 4, including negative 4, through 8, which is not included. The

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:40.647
inequality for this would be read as negative 4 is less than or equal to z is

00:00:40.647 --> 00:00:45.612
less than 8. We could also write this of course, using an and. Negative 4 is

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.470
less than or equal to z and z is less than 8.
