00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
I've given you several functions written out here. And for each of these

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:07.848
functions, I'd like you to identify the name of the function, the input of the

00:00:07.848 --> 00:00:11.920
function, and the output of the function, in terms of the input value. So I've

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.258
already filled in how you would do this for this first function. Which we would

00:00:16.258 --> 00:00:22.826
read as h of t, equals negative 9.8t squared. So here you can see that the name

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:28.255
of the function is h, the input is t, and the output is this expression over

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:33.555
here. Now you have 9.8t squared. So please fill in all of these boxes for the

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:34.791
other 2 functions.
