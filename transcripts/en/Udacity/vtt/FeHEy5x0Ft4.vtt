00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here we have a grammar that represents some made-up language,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
kind of a cross between--I don't know--Python and JavaScript.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It has a lot of keywords that are found in a lot of languages.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's say we add a new rule.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The question we need to answer is whether adding this new rule to this grammar

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
creates an ambiguous grammar.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As a reminder, an ambiguous grammar is one that given a string in that language,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
there are 2 parse trees, there are 2 ways to traverse the grammar and create that string.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
As we'll see later, this is really bad for languages that we want to interpret

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because it can result in the situation where 1 string, 1 program,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
1 HTML document has 2 valid meanings.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And so you can't really choose one,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and that's not what we like.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We use these precise languages such as HTML and JavaScript

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so that we know exactly what we want to be displayed

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
or the exact actions that we want to be performed. We don't want ambiguity.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Computers don't handle ambiguity very well. Their little brains explode.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We can sit and stare and think about this for a while,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but I'll just give you an example string that actually shows that adding this rule

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
makes the grammar ambiguous.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That gets us a check. Let's go over that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Here I have the string, and what we need to do is show that there's 2 ways

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
using this grammar to generate the string.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
One way is using the if-then-else construct

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
where this if, this then, and this else match here, here, and here.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That means this part of the string corresponds to this C,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
this one goes here, and this one is from the E right there. That's 1 way to do it.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The second way is using the if-then, do these 2 symbols,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and then the if-then-else here,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
meaning that this corresponds to that S,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
this corresponds to that E,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and then we have an if-then-else as that S.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So here's 2 valid ways using this grammar to generate the same string.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This shows that the grammar is ambiguous when we add this rule.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Let's do another.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Let's say we add this rule.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
B goes to a B and then a B.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is also ambiguous.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Say we have print 4; print 4.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So now we have 2 ways to create this.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
One way is to start with a B.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
From there we go to S and B.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
From here we can do print 4.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We can replace the B--oh, I forgot to add that.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We can replace the S with the print 4.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
An alternative way is basically do something very similar

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where we start with the B and we go to B B,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
but this time we replace each B with the S;

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's our second way.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Here there are 2 more rules.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Neither of these rules makes the grammar ambiguous.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
When we add the keyword int, this is the only way to get an int.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So there's not going to be a second way to generate strings with int.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The same basic logic applies to the parentheses as well.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This is the only way I have parentheses,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and there's not going to be a second way there.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
All it does is add parentheses on the outside of a statement.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And we can do it as many times as we want,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
but given x number of parentheses, you just apply this x number of times.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Not a whole lot of fancy stuff going here.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The fact that they match also is kind of a key contributor to this.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If you had a parenthesis on 1 side and you had another rule with the other side,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
then you could maybe get some ambiguity depending on how you word it.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But that's how this is. Let's go on to the last one.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This should look familiar.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I believe we went over this in lecture or something very similar to this,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and this is definitely ambiguous.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I'll come up with 1 example.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Say we have 1 + 2 + 3. We can do this in 2 ways.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:16.000
We have E goes to E + E goes to 1, and this eventually goes to 2 + 3.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
An alternative way is that we have the 2 on the left-hand side and then we have the 3.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Although the meaning of a plus, the associativity of addition

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
allows us to do it in any order, from the perspective of a language of strings,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
perspective of determining whether or not the context-free grammar is ambiguous,

00:04:34.000 --> 09:59:59.000
the meaning of a plus is irrelevant here.
