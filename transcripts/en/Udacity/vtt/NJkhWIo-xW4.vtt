00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.850
The next source of error,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.730
inconsistent data across locations,
should not come as a surprise.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.870
This is the interoperability issue we've
been discussing throughout the course.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.950
Where multiple physicians are involved,
it can be further complicated

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.660
by differences in the way they document
even the same clinical issues.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.050
Particularly when text
entry is involved.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.610
For example, they might use different
terms for the same thing, or

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.550
nonstandard abbreviations or acronyms.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.910
Similarly, physicians may not record
all the needed data leading to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.600
misinterpretations of the past history,
or even the current treatments.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.210
Finally, where multiple locations
are involved in patient's care,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.040
it may not be clear which
of several observations or

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.189
events is definitive or
even the most up-to-date
