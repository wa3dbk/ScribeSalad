00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.120
The second view not listed by Cruchen I consider to be quite important,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.810
and that's the non-functional view.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.400
In coming up a software architecture, it's youre responsibility not

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.510
only to describe a system that's going to compute what it needs to compute, but

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.170
also compute it in a way that satisfies those non-functional requirements.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.140
Satisfying non-functional requirements is hard,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.150
it often involves some kind of tradeoff, okay?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.680
So you need to be expressing what the options are and

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.760
how you decided to trade things off, and I'm suggesting here some tabular text.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.530
Here's an example, if you imagine a web browser and you say,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.790
what's it's major computational responsibility?

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.830
Well it's displaying web pages.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.620
Quite simple.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.200
But if you actually look at the code for

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.640
a web browser, it's filled with code having to do with managing caches.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.440
There are page caches and connection caches and image caches and so on.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.310
Okay?

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.790
Why are there caches?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.128
Well, caches are a technique for dealing with performance constraints and

00:01:07.128 --> 00:01:10.880
non-functional requirement, okay?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.370
So it's important to relate that information, first of all,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.500
that there is a performance requirement, and second of all, what technique is

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.820
being used to address that performance requirement, the caches.
