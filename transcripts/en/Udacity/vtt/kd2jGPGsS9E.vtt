00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Another topic that I would like to address is malformed HTML.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One of the questions on the forums was, are we going to talk about mistakes in web pages?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What if a real web developer forgets to close off a tag or makes a sort of subtle mistake

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in punctuation?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Are we going to talk about that in the web browser that we build for this class?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the answer is, yes!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In fact, very prescient on your part. That's a very predictive question.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're going to get to it in unit 3, exactly the next unit.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're going to talk about recognizing malformed HTML and JavaScript.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But in this class, we're mostly going to talk about recognizing them,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and for the particular project that we work on for our simple web browser,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if the HTML is malformed, we're not going to do anything about it.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We just won't render that part of the web page.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In practice, web browsers put a lot--a huge amount--of effort into being very forgiving.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They want to render as much information as possible, even if the web page is out of date

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or written without knowledge of the standards or in any other way messed up.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This approach of keeping going is sometimes known as error recovery

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
or error tolerance or fault tolerance.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In unit 3, we're going to talk about breaking up tokens and seeing if they match

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a particular structure, seeing if they're in the language of a formal grammar

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that describes all of JavaScript or all of web pages.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You know in the real world, a lot of web pages are not.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
They don't match the formal idealized grammar I've written down on the walls of Plato's cave.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Similarly, not every JavaScript program adheres to exactly the same idea of--

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to pick a timely example--where the semicolons go after statements.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So in practice, what you'll often want to do if you're doing commercial software

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
if you want to make your customers as happy as possible by supporting everything

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that they've written, you'll write about your duplicate rules.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
For example, you might write one regular expression that accepts normal numbers,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but if people make a common mistake when writing numbers,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
maybe they write multiple.multiple period signs or something like that,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you might write another rule that accepts those,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and maybe print out some warning but then does it's best to figure out what the value is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and keeps going.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Again, in real world industrial software development for a web browser,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
this sort of error recovery when you're doing lexical analysis or syntactic analysis

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is of critical importance because the vast majority of web pages are not

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
standards compliant.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In this class, we're going to tell you how to tell the difference between good HTML and bad,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
between well-formed JavaScript and malformed JavaScript.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But I'm only going to require that you deal with well-formed strings.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Once you know how to do it the good way though,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
you could do it for ill-formed strings.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You'd have all the tools after finishing this class.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It would just be more busy work, elbow grease.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It would take additional time, and it wouldn't really teach you more concepts.

00:02:57.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That's why I'm not going to focus on it.
