00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.060
In this session we're going to
talk about a new data type

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.480
called an optional.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.290
Optionals were introduced into the Swift
programming language to handle

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.210
the concept of nullability,
or the absence of a value.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.670
There's no denying that optional
types are both unusual and tricky.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.200
But if you're going to become
confident using Swift,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.630
it's essential to understand
optionals inside and out.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.270
Let's get started.
