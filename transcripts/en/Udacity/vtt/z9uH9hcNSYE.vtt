00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.200
So now let's get back to our retina.

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.920
So here we are.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.480
So we, we've sort of talked, you know,
very briefly about the photo detectors.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.410
Now we're going to talk
about the ganglion cells.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.900
One of the things about the ganglion
cells is that they take

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.550
information from these things called
these horizontal and bipolar cells and

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.920
the horizontal cells just as you might
think they take information across

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.300
a local area and bring them
together to the ganglion cells.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.510
So you might ask why would you do that.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.960
&gt;&gt; Why would you do that?

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.980
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Megan.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.729
Okay.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.310
There are a lot of reasons.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.900
One of which has to do
with dynamic range.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.570
In fact, you know what,
let's go to this picture first, and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.970
then we'll go to the numbers.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.200
So here's a series of photographs
where you adjust the amount of light

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.330
coming into the image from a thousandth
of a second to a quarter of a second.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.880
You see here there's an outdoor
part of the scene right there.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.830
So a thousandth of a second isn't enough
when you open it up a little bit more it

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.560
gets a little bit easier
to see these things.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.870
And then as I let in enough light that
I can see the interior really well

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.290
this outdoor thing is totally blown out.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.830
And yet, if you were to stand there,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.050
what you would see is something
that looks like this.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.570
You'd have no problem seeing
the indoor stuff and outdoor stuff.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.470
It might be a little bit harder to see,
but not anything like the camera and

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.355
that's because your system deals with
dynamic range so much more effectively.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:26.690
Okay.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.890
Here's another example of photographing
a high dynamic range scene.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.170
Right, so, if you wanted to see
the stained glass really well you'd

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140
have to miss the rest of
the inside of the church.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.110
If you want to see the rest
of the inside of the church

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.570
these things get blown out.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.830
But you would have no
problem seeing this.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.930
You would see that beautiful stained
glass, and you would see the church.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.630
You now know that there
are a couple of photography methods

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.470
called high dynamic range, so you have
a high dynamic range on your iPhone, or

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.430
your little phone, or whatever, or
in Photoshop, something like that.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.050
That's a way of blending together
a series of pictures to automatically

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.304
select which regions from which
image should be selected,

00:02:03.304 --> 00:02:07.730
or, or how much you dial up or
dial down each region of, of the image

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.230
in order to composite the whole thing
into a high dynamic range image.
