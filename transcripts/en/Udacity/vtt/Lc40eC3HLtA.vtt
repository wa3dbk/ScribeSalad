00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.260
So let's recap the major changes
we just made to the app.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.800
We changed from using a loop to
populate a vertical linear layout,

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.140
to display a list of words,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.620
to using a more efficient ListView
+ ArrayAdapter combination.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.730
And then we built a list item
layout that contains two TextViews.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.950
So next we wanted to create a single
list of objects that we could pass to

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.050
the ArrayAdapter.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.200
So we created a custom work class
that contains both the English and

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.180
Miwok translations for a single word.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.253
Without we could have an ArrayList of
word objects that we could pass to

00:00:30.253 --> 00:00:31.095
an array adaptor.

00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:33.620
Now let's navigate to
the numbers activity.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.020
Here we'll need to change our ArrayList
of strings into an ArrayList of words.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.920
So we need to update the generic type
parameter, what's in between those

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.540
brackets and create an ArrayList
where each element is a word object.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.740
You might get two auto
complete suggestions.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.700
It is because the word class already
exist in the Android framework

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.710
under a different package name.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.240
So here,
you'll see it's under UserDictionary.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.800
So these are words that you can add
to your auto complete dictionary say,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.650
when you're messaging your friends.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.010
So be sure to pick the correct
option for the word class,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.958
we want the ones in our package
com.example.android.miwok.

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:13.170
So now we've updated our ArrayList to
contain word objects instead of string

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.210
objects.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.060
So remember that I'm specifying word as
a parameter of the ArrayList, this means

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.240
that when we add elements to the list,
we'll need to objects of data type word.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.500
And if were to say call the get method,
which is used for getting elements

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.950
at specific position in the list will
receive an object with a data type word.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.476
So currently all these add methods,
or adding a single string object to

00:01:34.476 --> 00:01:38.257
the words list each time, and that's
why we're getting all these errors.

00:01:38.257 --> 00:01:42.725
So we need to update each of these
lines to pass in a single word object.

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:44.814
So let's just focus on
this first element here.

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:46.525
So I'm going to comment it out.

00:01:46.525 --> 00:01:50.081
So below it, I'm going to write in the
version of the code where we're adding

00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:51.894
in a new Word object to the words list.

00:01:51.894 --> 00:01:53.740
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.390
Here's the typical way to go about this.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.423
We would've created a new Word object,
store it in a variable here called w and

00:02:01.423 --> 00:02:04.257
then added that variable
to our words list.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.668
So now here the one we're
creating our new word object,

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.660
we're passing in two new
inputs into the constructor.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.490
So the english and miwok words.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.963
So since we only need to reference
this w variable once here.

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:19.060
There's actually a more concise way
to write these two lines of code.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.260
So this method of creating a word
object and adding it to the list,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.770
does work, but there's actually
a more concise way to do it.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.870
So you'll notice here that we
only reference this variable w

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.540
once down here.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.160
So we can go ahead and actually cut out
the substantiation of the word object

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.240
and paste it directly
into the add method.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.176
So doing it this way, we don't need this
extra step up here to create a new Word

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:45.110
object on a separate line of code and
then store it into a temporary variable.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.540
So we can actually go ahead and
just remove this line completely.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.840
Instead, we've directly added our
new Word object into the list.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.041
So to summarize, the input into this
list is a new Word object which

00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:59.830
is created in line by
using the new keyword.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.048
I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:04.134
finish populating the ArrayList
with the word objects.

00:03:04.134 --> 00:03:06.064
When you're all done,
this is what the code for

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:08.780
creating an ArrayList of
words should look like.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.368
So let's move down here to
where we're passing our

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:13.121
ArrayList into the adapter down.

00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:17.370
So we need to update this generic
type from string to be words.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.220
And this change reflects that the
ArrayAdapter now contains the list of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.400
words as a status source
instead of strings.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.420
We'll also need to update the layout
resource to be our new list item layout.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.460
So instead of this,
we'll have R.layout.List_item.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.260
So now there's no errors in the code
now, so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.120
run the app on my device.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.396
So here's the emulator,
running this version of the app.

00:03:38.396 --> 00:03:40.784
Let's navigate into
the numbers activity.

00:03:40.784 --> 00:03:44.325
That just crashed,
I wonder what happened?

00:03:44.325 --> 00:03:47.490
Let's check out the Android monitor and
check out the Android logs.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.649
Well at the very top of the log message,
we see here that it says,

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:56.588
Java.Lang.IllegalStateException
ArrayAdapter requires the resource

00:03:56.588 --> 00:03:57.916
ID to be a text view.

00:03:57.916 --> 00:04:01.564
I'm not exactly sure what this error
means, so I'm going to have to go

00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:05.445
into the documentation and
see if I can find any clues.

00:04:05.445 --> 00:04:08.650
Here's the developer documentation for
the ArrayAdapter.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.790
So let's read through
the Class Overview.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.610
Alternatively, you can also
pause the video here if you want

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.480
to read through it yourself.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.658
So what I've learn from these couple
of paragraphs is By default, the class

00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:25.132
expects that the provided resource
id references a single text view.

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:29.689
That's probably why the list item layout
from the Android framework itself worked

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.891
because the whole layout
consisted of a single TextView.

00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:36.577
And here in this next paragraph
we see that we can add lists or

00:04:36.577 --> 00:04:38.288
arrays of custom objects.

00:04:38.288 --> 00:04:41.800
So that's perfect for us to help
display our custom word objects.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.233
Now all this makes sense because
remember that the ArrayAdapter uses

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:46.240
generics.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.590
Which means we can substitute any
object data type in here for this team.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.840
Now, moving down to the third paragraph,
in order to display more

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.940
complicated list items that can pertain
more than a single text view, we'll need

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.870
to override and provide our own
implementation of a getView() method.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.869
So ListView cause the adaptors getView()
method when It needs a new view

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:06.715
on the screen.

00:05:06.715 --> 00:05:10.845
And one of the input arguments into
the method is the desired element of

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:12.410
the list.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.100
So in this case we have
position 0 that we need.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.922
Knowing this information, the adapter
returns a view to the ListView,

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:25.003
that's populated with
the information from the position 0.

00:05:25.003 --> 00:05:29.911
So think of the relationship between the
ListView And getView, similar to what

00:05:29.911 --> 00:05:35.270
happens between a surgeon and a surgical
technician in an operating room.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:40.300
So in this analogy, the surgical
technician like the getView,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.770
hands the surgeon the ListView,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.480
the correct instrument of the correct
view when the time comes.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.610
So the ListView or surgeon requests for
the view or the scissors in this case.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.370
The getView gets what's needed,
the View or

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.560
in this case the scissors and
passes it to the surgeon.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.530
So by default,

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.670
the ArrayAdaptor class expects that
it'll be populating a single TextView.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:09.060
So because the List item layout that we
will be populating is more complex so

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.360
it has two TextViews and
it eventually will have a image view.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.273
We need to override the getView
method with our own custom behavior.

00:06:18.273 --> 00:06:22.120
And in order to do this, we need to
sub class the ArrayAdapter class.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.962
So to elaborate, this means we
need to create a new Java class.

00:06:26.962 --> 00:06:32.690
So we'll call it the WordAdapter class
and use extend the ArrayAdapter class.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.376
So I'll show you how
to get that done now.

00:06:34.376 --> 00:06:36.440
So let's navigate over
here to the project view.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.860
Select our package,
right-click, New &gt; Java Class.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.960
So we want to name
this file WordAdapter.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.510
We'll need to modify this auto
generated file from Android Studio.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:54.230
We want this class declaration to
specify that the WordAdapter extends or

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:57.350
inherits behavior from
the ArrayAdapter class.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.700
Now to show the available methods to
override from the ArrayAdapter class,

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.660
our cursor will have to be
between these two brackets.

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.860
We'll hit Code and
then override methods.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.714
Alternatively the keyboard shortcut
is Ctrl+O, now in this list here,

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:14.779
go down and find getView and
then click Enter.

00:07:14.779 --> 00:07:18.060
So this method gets auto
generated by default.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.310
Now I'm going to take a step back and
let you finish the steps that are needed

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.813
to make this app display
the list of vocabulary words for

00:07:23.813 --> 00:07:24.892
the numbers activity.

00:07:24.892 --> 00:07:28.493
So the steps will include finishing the
implementation of the getView method.

00:07:28.493 --> 00:07:32.100
When you're done with this entire quiz,
the app should look like this.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.050
Each list item should display
a miwok word on top of the English

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.780
translation for that word.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.408
Now to help verify your own track,
I'm going to provide you

00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:42.389
with some code changes that
are needed in the numbers activity.

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:46.615
So instead of the ArrayAdapter
we'll be using a WordAdapter.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.328
So the constructor fo the WordAdapter
class takes in two inputs.

00:07:51.328 --> 00:07:53.818
So just the context and
this list of words and

00:07:53.818 --> 00:07:58.195
then also remember to update
the adapter variable down here.

00:07:58.195 --> 00:08:01.285
Now make sure your WordAdapter class
works with these number activities

00:08:01.285 --> 00:08:05.255
changes, otherwise you'll need to go
back and fix your WordAdapter class.

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:08.300
Now I know this clean exercise will be a
bit of a challenge, because you've never

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.520
created a custom ArrayAdapter before or
even overridden the getView method.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.270
This task involves many steps, but I
think you're definitely ready for this.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:17.760
Now just be patient with yourself,

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.620
because this task will
require a bit of time.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.940
To give you another hint,

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.360
I'll point you an example app
which handles a similar use case.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:30.090
So this project here is hosted on
GitHub as an open source project and

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:33.429
this mean that the code is available for
anyone to take a look at.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.490
So know that there's a different
license on each open source project.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.465
So remember to check out the license for

00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:42.971
limitations on whether the code can
be modified or distribute again.

00:08:42.971 --> 00:08:45.320
If you're taking a look at
a particular open source project.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.260
So in this case,
this app was created at Udacity, so

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.300
you're free to use it and
adapt it as you wish.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.680
So our Customer Adapter Sample App is
called the Android Flavors app, and

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.820
it displays a list of
all Android releases.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:05.240
So each release is represented
in a list item, and

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.660
each list item could contain an image,
a title and the version number.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.070
So this app is using a customer
ArrayAdapter they were calling

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.302
the FlavorAdapter to display a custom
list item view that contains

00:09:19.302 --> 00:09:21.131
an image and two times used.

00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:25.183
So having you practice this skill
of reading code from other apps and

00:09:25.183 --> 00:09:28.770
figuring out how to adapt
it into army lock app.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.370
So as a developer, you often looked at
tutorials or other open source for apps.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.979
And try to apply those skills
into your own application.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.780
So you can start browsing this Android
Flavor app code by either flicking this

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.896
Download Zip button.

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:45.865
And then downloading all the code and
then importing into Android Studio as

00:09:45.865 --> 00:09:50.700
an existing project, or you can browse
the files directly in the web browser.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.859
So for example, I can click here,
app &gt; source/main,

00:09:54.859 --> 00:09:58.470
and then navigate through
the Java files or the rest files.

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.690
Another cool GitHub shortcut here
is to type T on my keyboard, so

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.130
I'll hit T here, and
that activates the file finder.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.858
So this allows me to easily browse
through the files in my project.

00:10:11.858 --> 00:10:15.656
So if I want to look up that main
activity, I can type activity and

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:17.959
it pulls up our mainActivity.java.

00:10:17.959 --> 00:10:20.908
Or if I want to search up the
FlavorAdapter that I mentioned earlier,

00:10:20.908 --> 00:10:22.830
I can easily find that here.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.890
So hopefully this example will help
you in the next coding exercise.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.830
So check out the quiz for specific
instructions on how to get started, and

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.340
best of luck.
