00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.420
&gt;&gt; That's good, David. But here's something interesting to note.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.980
It could have been that this was the input sentence and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.240
that this frame representation got constructed from this input sentence. So

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.680
Haruto became the subject and the person and ate became the verb and

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.336
so on. Alternately, this could have been the frame representation and

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:41.171
perhaps the sentence which error gets through language generation from this

00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:46.380
frame representation. So the frame representation could potentially act as

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.430
an intermediate representation for both sentence comprehension and for

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.850
sentence generation. Of course, there's a lot more to sentence generation and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.480
to sentence comprehension than what we have shown so far.
