00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.740
All right,
let's move onto drawing rectangles now.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.540
The first interesting
thing about rectangles,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.490
is that they can be drawn with
two different shape types.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.650
They can either be drawn with shape
type line, just to get the outlines of

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.790
the rectangles, or shape type
filled to fill in the rectangles.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.705
Let's go with filled for now.

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.980
shapeRenderer.rect is overloaded with
about a dozen different functions to

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.380
do different things.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.350
Honestly, to have a look at them
all you should probably just

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.280
check out the documentation.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.680
The basic version though,
draws an access aligned rectangle,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.470
starting with the lower left corner and
then giving the width and the height.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.480
Let's try running this.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.295
So far, so good.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:41.060
Let's do something more interesting.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.470
We can do some super fun
stuff with the colors and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.630
rectangles, like specifying a color for
each corner.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.340
Let's try this.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.300
There we go,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.810
the rectangle smoothly transitions
between the colors at the corners.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.940
These next two rectangles
are being drawn in such a way that

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.190
one's going to overlap the other.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.590
So, which one do you think
is going to come out on top?

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.230
Is it this red one,
which is being drawn first, or

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.940
the green one that's being drawn second?

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.880
Ha, look like the green one wins.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.460
When shape render is asked to
draw things on top of each other

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.950
it uses what's called
the painter's algorithm.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.610
Just like the initial layers of paint
laid down by a painter get covered up

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.890
by what gets pained later, similarly,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.550
shapes that are drawn later on will
cover up shapes that were drawn earlier.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.310
We can also use shape render
to draw rotated rectangles.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.510
Now here's where the signature of
rect starts getting pretty crazy and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.920
the documentation will come in handy.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.940
Again, here is the bottom left corner,
and here's the width and height now.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.980
And this entry is the origin
about which we'll be rotating.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.890
So if the width and height are both 100,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.239
then 50/50 is right in
the middle of the rectangle.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.790
Then we have the x scale,
the y scale, and rotation.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.110
So, we're drawing this 100 by 100, but
then we're going to squash it by 50%

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.190
horizontally, and
rotate it by 45 degrees.

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.000
Same thing with this one, except
we're going to rotate it 135 degrees.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.008
Let's check out what this looks like.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.619
Cool.
So we've got two rectangles that were

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:12.670
drawn at the same spot.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.740
They were smashed by 50% horizontally,
and

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.130
then the yellow one was
rotated by 45 degrees.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.080
So it was initially straight up and
down, and now it's tilted to the left.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.830
And the green one has been
rotated by 135 degrees.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.625
To more easily understand what's
going on with this origin parameter,

00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.710
let's try something very similar.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.140
The setup is almost identical,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.530
but instead of the origin being
in the middle of the rectangle,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.420
the origin is now down at the bottom
left corner of the rectangle.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.250
So now, the rectangle's instead of
being rotated about their center,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.620
are being rotated about
this bottom left corner.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:47.500
OpenGL has an interesting quirk.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.050
It knows how to draw in filled shapes,
but

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.060
it doesn't know how to draw thick lines.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.580
So if we want a thick line,
what we actually need is just a rotated,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.800
super skinny rectangle.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.520
Thankfully, shapeRenderer gives
us a super simple way to do this.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.350
It's called rectLine.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.310
We give it the x and the y position
of the start of the line, the x and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.860
y position of the end of the line,
and the thickness.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.565
And there we go, we get a fat line.

00:03:13.565 --> 00:03:17.680
[LAUGH] All right, last thing,
time for some silliness.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.100
Let's draw a rainbow flower, this
might come in handy for the next quiz.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.220
Pretty cool, right?
