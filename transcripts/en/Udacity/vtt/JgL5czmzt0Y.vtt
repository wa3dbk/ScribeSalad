00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.391
So, Vista is the RVM library that has been implemented on top of the Rio file

00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:08.830
cache, and let's see how that works. The

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.410
semantics of RVM that is implemented in this

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.550
is exactly the same as what we saw in the previous lesson, namely LRVM. It is

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.890
just that the implementation takes advantage of the

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.670
fact that it is sitting on top of

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.400
a Rio file cache. So what we're going to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.930
do in implementing RVM using the Rio file cache

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.280
is to map the data segment to the virtual

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.330
memory. Exactly similar to what was done in the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.190
LRVM primitive. So, when we map the external data

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.120
segment to virtual memory, by definition now, this portion

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.390
of the memory becomes persistent because it is contained

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.410
in the file cache and the file cache survives

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.960
power failure because of the battery backup. And

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.231
therefore, now we have made this portion of

00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:58.280
the virtual memory, that is mapped to the

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.280
data segment, persistent. So when we hit the begin

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.480
transaction call in the application, what we're going to

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.330
do is make a before image of the portion

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.930
of the virtual memory that we're going to modify

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.100
during this transaction. Remember that in the RVM library,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.790
the set of operations that you do

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.840
to virtual memory between begin transaction and end

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.070
transaction. The user's intent is that those changes

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.150
are for persistent data structures. And the persistent

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.800
data structures that they want to modify, they

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.070
would execute a set range call to say

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.010
what portion of that address range needs to

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.100
persistent. So. What we do in this Vista,

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.860
which is an implementation of RVM is, at

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.600
the point of begin transaction, we're going to make

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.850
a before image, a copy, in-memory copy, of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.820
the portion of the address space that we intend

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.280
to modify during this transaction. That will serve

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.470
as the undo log. Now, note that this is

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.180
also mapped to the file cache, so the undo log is mapped to the file cache and

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.230
therefore this undo log, is by definition, persistent

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.490
node. So the undo record that we create

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.910
in memory, we back it up on the file cache and therefore this undo log that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.540
we have created is actually persistent. It'll survive

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.760
failures. So when the program is executing the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.330
body of the transaction, it's doing normal program

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.400
rights to a portion of the virtual address space

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.180
where it has persistent data structures as well.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.460
So when it does this normal program rights to

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.260
this virtual memory. The portion of the virtual memory

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.320
that is mapped to this external data segment is,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.580
by definition, persistent and so these normal programs

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.490
rights actually get into the data segment, their being

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.370
persistent automatically because this portion of the virtual address

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.000
space is mapped to this data segment. Which is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
in the file cache and therefore persistent because

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.510
of the battery backing. So all the changes

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.990
that we are making during the execution of

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.340
the body of the transaction code is actually getting

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120
persisted in the original data segment. For which

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.010
this was an in-memory copy, but the in-memory copy

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.720
is actually sitting in file cache, which is

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.090
battery backed. Then we reach the end transaction in

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.230
the application code, and remember, in the end

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.750
transaction is when a change has had to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.540
be committed. Well, you know what? The changes

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.380
are already committed because that is the semantic

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.970
of mapping the latest segment in virtual memory.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.020
And because the file cache is persistent, all

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.290
the changes that we made to the virtual

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.270
memory during these normal program writes are actually reflected

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.650
in the data segment. So the end transaction

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.720
at commit point, you don't have to do

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.320
anything other than getting rid of this undo

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.100
log, because the transaction is committed and therefore you

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.770
can throw away this undo log and all

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.560
the changes are already in there by design, by

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.460
construction. Just as an aside, if you think

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.700
about LRV implementation, commit point is the point where

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.899
there is heavy lifting to be done. Because

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.600
in LRVM, at the commit point, the redo

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.810
log, which had been created by LRVM, to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.780
reflect the changes to the persistent data structures in

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.750
memory, have to be forced to the disk.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.580
But in Vista, which is implementation of RVM

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.710
on a persistent file cashe, no work needs

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.710
to be done at the point of end transaction

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.060
for commit because all the changes that the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.130
application developer intended to be committed to the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.490
data segment are already in there. And therefore,

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.480
at commit point, all that needs to be

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.100
done by Vista is to get rid of this undo log. On the other hand, if the

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.720
transaction aborts, in that case, what needs to be done is the undo record that

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.390
we created at the beginning of the transaction, the

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.530
before image, we are to take that and copy

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.730
it back into the portion of the virtual memory

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.140
that we modified, because that is a semantic of RBM.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.740
That if the transaction aborts, we restore the virtual

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.570
memory back to it's original state before the beginning of

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.510
the transaction. So the before image that we saved

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.980
at the beginning of the transaction, we copy it back

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.992
into this portion of the virtual memory that

00:05:32.992 --> 00:05:35.980
has been modified during this transaction. And once we

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.040
do that, we can throw away the undo log.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.560
And when we restore the before image into the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.490
virtual memory that we're also correcting whatever changes we

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.460
made to the data segment automatically. Because, remember that

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.350
this picture is just showing the virtual address space

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.300
of the process and this is really the physical

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.680
memory which is being used as a file cache battery backed and a portion of

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.480
the virtual address space is in this battery

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.290
pack file cache, rest of the address base

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.375
of the application, does not need persistence,

00:06:09.375 --> 00:06:12.180
that can be a normal physical memory. Only

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.460
the portion of the application memory that has

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.360
persistence guarantees through the data segment needs to

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.760
be mapped to this portion of the physical memory

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.552
that is battery backed. So just to recap what happens

00:06:27.552 --> 00:06:29.872
at end transaction, if it's a commit, no work

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:31.670
to be done except to get rid of the undo

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:36.010
record. All the changes to persistent data structures are

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.860
already in there in the data segment. On the other

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.740
hand, if it aborts, restore the old image back

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.652
into the virtual memory, I am back in business as

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:48.880
though these transaction never happened. The implication of

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.950
this Vista implementation, which is RVM on top of

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:57.210
Rio file cache, is that there is no disk IO at all. And there is no redo

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.250
log, because we directly writing into the data

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.040
segments All the external data segments that we define

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.200
in the initialization of the RVM library on

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.870
the disk, they become memory resident when you map

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.510
them into the virtual address space of the

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.990
application. So the external data segments become persistent because

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:22.030
of being brought into the file cache. And mapped

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.070
into the virtual memory space of the server application.
