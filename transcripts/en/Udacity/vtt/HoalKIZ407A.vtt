00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Here's the only place where quotes are handled. Tag is always false.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This condition: if we see a quote and tag, then only we should go into quote mode,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it should actually never hold. But maybe there's something wrong with this condition.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's come up with the new hypothesis.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
A new hypothesis is the error is due to the quote condition evaluating to true.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's come up with an experiment to verify this hypothesis.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
If this condition evaluates to true, then the next line should be executed.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So what we do is, we simply write an assert false in here,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
meaning that the assertion should now automatically fail, if this ever gets executed.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So this piece of code should actually never be reached when executing the program.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Our expectation this time is, with this input, this assertion should fail.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Again, we make this quiz: after we inserted assert false,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
does the program now raise an exception meaning that the quote condition holds,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and therefore, something's wrong with that condition

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
or is the output still foo, that is the input with the quote strip,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and then the quote condition obviously does not hold because the assert false is never reached?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Try this out for yourself.
