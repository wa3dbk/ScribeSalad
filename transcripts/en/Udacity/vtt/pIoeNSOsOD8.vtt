00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.730
So, we have used the O state to avoid
inefficiency of the MSI protocol that

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.810
had to do with the memory,
getting unnecessary accesses that

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.370
could be satisfied by caches
that already have the data.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.450
There is another inefficiency
that both MSI and MOSI have.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.610
And that inefficiency is related
to thread private data, or

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.840
data that is only ever
accessed by a single thread.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.090
And thread private data is for

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.330
example, all data in a single threaded
program will be thread private.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.180
So if we have a four core processor
around four single threaded programs,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.160
they never share any data.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.110
All of the data in these
programs is like this.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.870
Even when we have a parallel program,
we still have data such as for

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.800
example, the stacks of
the individual threads

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.280
that are still going to be
accessed only by a single thread.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.730
And then efficiency occurs when
we read the data in a thread, and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.790
then we write it, and this is really
the only thread accessing this data.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.500
With both MSI and MOSI,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.160
what's going to happen is the data
was invalid before we had it.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.470
We read it.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.010
We have a miss.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.080
Now we get the data in the shared state.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.530
When we want to write it, because
it's a shared state, we need to send

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.100
out an invalidation, and then we have
the block in the modified state.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.530
And for every single block of data,
we have to do this.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.780
In contrast,
if we had that uniprocessor,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.800
the block would have a valid bit of 0,
we read it, we have a miss.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.028
Now, the value bit becomes 1, and
then we have a hit when we write it, and

00:01:38.028 --> 00:01:43.890
then we just change the dirty bit to 1,
so somehow the uniprocessor gets to do

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.220
a miss here and a hit here,
whereas to do MSI or

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.390
MOSI, we have to do a miss
followed by another bus request.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.420
Granted, it doesn't carry data,
but still we have to wait for

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.310
the bus, send something
outside the ship and so on, so

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.350
this is still a lot slower
than just a cache hit.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.600
And it's okay to pay the penalty for
having coherence if we're actually

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.260
sharing the data, because a uniprocessor
would not provide coherent behavior.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.538
But here,
we actually have no sharing whatsoever.

00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:20.610
So what we want to do is
avoid this invalidation, and

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.350
to do that, we introduce
a new state called exclusive.
