00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.370
My name is Andy Isaacson, and
I'm a Fullstack engineer at Udacity.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.700
When I say I'm a Fullstack engineer,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.540
it kind of means I do a little
bit of the both, right.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.300
I kind of do some front end and
some back end.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.540
My background,
when I first started out programming,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.920
I was doing hardcore computer science.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.450
And I kind of got interested in
thinking about the user more, so

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.770
looking at aspects of psychology.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.090
Thinking about how people learn and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.825
how people think about
the systems that they're using.

00:00:28.825 --> 00:00:33.350
I really was interested in building
interfaces that worked well for people.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.410
And the more projects that I did,

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.650
the more I found myself kind of
floating to that role within my team,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.880
being the guy who put together the
system that everything was talking to.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.250
And actually since coming to Udacity,
my sweet spot is really thinking about

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.110
how to build the systems
that power the front ends.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.450
The front end is cool because it exists

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.805
right in the moment that
someone's using it.

00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:56.670
It's right just on their screen.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.620
But the back end sort of covers
everybody who's using a big system

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.168
at the same time.

00:01:00.168 --> 00:01:04.800
And so it's really kind of fun
to build the sort of larger

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.600
piece that's kind of
underpinning everything, and

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.070
thinking about some of the unique
problems that come up there.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.190
One of the backend pieces that I'm
working on right now is what's going to

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.610
be the foundation of the next
iteration of the Udacity platform.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.948
So we're migrating from what was
kind of a monolithic application

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:29.880
on top of Google app engine into
a network of micro services.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.650
And so, putting all the backend
underpinnings in place,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.440
before we can even think about
building out the interfaces.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.090
With the backend you really want to
take that step back and think critically

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.110
about is this going to slowly eat up
all my memory and destroy my server?

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.350
Is this going to create a security
hole that somebody might be

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.350
able to use to get
information they shouldn't?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.030
Or is this going

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.740
to be a performance bottleneck
that'll screw everything else up?

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.180
And so, yeah, there's a little
more kind of structured thinking,

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.050
I think, that goes into that.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.990
If you've got a problem with a frontend
system, and you're debugging it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.080
in your machine in front of you, you can
put a breakpoint in, you can stop it in

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.700
the middle, you can just kind of
poke in and see what's happening.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.550
And you're going to figure out on a very
detailed level what the issues are.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.760
But with a production system, you can't
really just stop it and go with that.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.380
You want it to keep serving,
keep running, keep possibly working for

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.610
all the other people who are using it.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.230
And so some of the tools that I'll
employ, I mean, first off, there's logs.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.350
That's number one, hands down, the way
you're going to look at any problem.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.195
Look back at the logs and
see did the usual thing

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:47.540
happen,or was an error thrown
somewhere along the way?

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.690
But sometimes the logs look fine.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.880
And it doesn't help you any.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.970
All it says is maybe it's really slow,
maybe this step took ten minutes and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.400
you don't really know why.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.380
It definitely takes putting on
your detective hat sometimes and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.040
thinking really carefully about what
the code is doing under the hood.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.990
It's not like you get
direct access all the time.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.290
Sometimes you have to be
a little indirect about

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.470
poking at it from outside.
