00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.059
The first solution is acceptable, for the most part. It solves the problem of

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:08.670
two surfaces being in the same location. However, it does change the geometry

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.320
of the model, which might not be acceptable. also, even surfaces that are near

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.270
each other can still have Z-fighting problems, since the Z buffer has limits on

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.700
its precision. So, this solution works, but it's not optimal. The second

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.770
solution sounds nice. A new graphics card is always fun, but it doesn't help at

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.350
all. Since both surfaces are in an identical location, which one happens to be

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.610
closer is entirely arbitrary. Another GPU can and will give you a different

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.610
view of Z-fighting. So if you like the Z-fighting effect, you can control it if

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.610
your users are on different machines with different GPUs. The third answer is

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.160
switching to another is switching to another rendering algorithm, again, will

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.040
just cause different precision errors to show up. The underlying problem of two

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.980
surfaces being in the same place is a modeling error and can't be solved by

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.080
rendering. The forth answer, removing the bottom part of the leg that overlaps

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.950
with the foot, is certainly the cleanest solution. This is also the most

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.160
efficient answer, as making the object smaller will mean it covers less pixels

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.630
and so causes less work.
