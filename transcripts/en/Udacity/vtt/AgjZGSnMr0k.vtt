00:00:00.215 --> 00:00:02.630
Let's take a look at
the life cycle of APT.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.630
It starts by identifying
the attack target.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.570
For example, the target can be
a automobile or aerospace company.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.230
Then, the attacker will research
about the target, in particular,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.590
obtaining information about a target
organization, that can help the attack.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950
For example, using network scanning and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.010
analysis, the attacker can learn
the target organization's network, and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.500
therefore, the vulnerabilities
of his network services.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.550
Such as, the possible security
flaws of it's web servers.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.160
And by researching the web,
the attacker can also

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.810
learn the organization's C level
executives and their email addresses.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.790
For example, many companies list their
C level executives on their webpages.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.210
And once you know their names,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.528
it is not hard to find their email
addresses by doing some web search.

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.520
Then, the attacker code can
develop a method to penetrate

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.250
the organization's network.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.990
He can make sure that the attack
will go through, without detection,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.880
by utilizing the knowledge he has
learned about the organization.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.525
For example, the attacker can
exploit a new vulnerability

00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:09.445
of the organization's web server.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:12.965
And since, the vulnerability is
unknown to the security community,

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:17.605
the network defenses at the organization
won't be able to detect this exploit.

00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.372
Or, the attacker can send a so

00:01:19.372 --> 00:01:24.530
called deficit email to the chief
marketing officer of the organization.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.240
It is called, spear fishing,
because the attacker has spent time

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.050
learning about the organization and
the individual.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.800
And so,
the email would appear to be legitimate.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.380
Once the the exploit succeeds, now the
APT has a foothold in the organization.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.450
It can then communicate back
to the attacker, for example,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.980
it can accept new malware updates,
receive commands, et cetera.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.410
For example, it can now exfiltrate
valuable data, such as,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.220
the design of a new airplane.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.076
The APT will try not to raise any
suspicion, so that it can go undetected.

00:01:57.076 --> 00:02:00.425
For example, he wouldonly exfiltrate
data from the server only,

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:04.075
only when there are other legitimate
network connections, from that server,

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.605
to the Internet.

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:06.845
And it does not operate,

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:11.209
on any other server, if that server
is not useful to the current task.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.945
That is, he would keep his footprint,
as small as possible, whereas,

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:18.240
the previous generations of malware,
including bottom worms,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.730
would try to infect as
many machines as possible.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.860
This cycle repeats and continues.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.470
For example, the attacker,
based on information sent from the APT

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.020
inside the organization,
now learns that there is another part

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.180
of the organization that also
holds even more valuable data.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.320
The attacker now identifies that part
of the organization as a new target,

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.990
and this cycle continues.
