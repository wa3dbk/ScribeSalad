00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.040
Let's take a second to think about the past couple of quizzes you've done. We

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.400
saw that a vertical line, reflected in the line y equals x, becomes a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.630
horizontal line. Now, just like we have the vertical line test to determine if

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.534
graphs are functions, remember, it says that a given curve is a function if it

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:23.446
only crosses a vertical line at one point for each value of x in the domain. We

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:27.042
can perform another test on the graph to figure out if its reflection in the

00:00:27.042 --> 00:00:32.029
line, y equals x would be a function. That would mean that it has an inverse.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.159
Which of these statements do you think is true, then? A function has an inverse

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:41.011
if no horizontal line passes through its graph at more than one point. A

00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.224
function has an inverse if no vertical line passes through its graph at more

00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:48.940
than one point. A function has an inverse if all horizontal lines pass through

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.665
its graph at more than one point. Or, a function has an inverse if the line, y

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:59.176
equals x, passes through its graph at more than one point. Think back to the

00:00:59.176 --> 00:01:03.503
vertical line test, and how functions are related to their inverses.
