00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.880
So, before we jump into these questions, let's talk

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.689
a bit about how to approach these assignments. Most

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.910
of these questions won't have a correct answer. Rather

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.520
than asking you to choose the correct definition of user

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.210
experience we're actually going to ask you to do some

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.950
design. We're also going to ask a lot of questions where

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.430
the only output from you to us is your

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.440
response to the question, did you do this? Now obviously,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.540
the purpose of a question like this is not to

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.450
prevent plagiarism. The assumption here is you are in this course,

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.680
you want to learn how to improve your design skills. And,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
anyways, if you are actually enrolled in the class, your final

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.950
grade of pass or no pass will be based only on

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.060
your final project. So, the purpose of a question like this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.470
is really to help you keep track of the questions you've

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.930
answered and which ones you haven't. You get that nice little

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.140
orange bubble filled in somewhere up here in the

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.540
navigation when you've completed a question. And, another part of

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.650
the reason why we ask these questions is for

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.210
us, and for the continued improvement of this class. We

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.069
want to know if the people taking this class

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.580
are doing the assignments. We're also going to ask you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
to submit to the forum quite a bit. And let

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
me actually talk about that a bit more. So working

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.880
on this course with Nasman and Isabel has

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.390
been awesome. Pretty early into the design of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.740
this class, we realized that the design process

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.960
that. We at Udacity have sort of converged on

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.070
over the last few years, is essentially identical

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.640
to the design process that Nasman and Isabelle

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.420
advocate for, in the world of software. One

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.280
example of this, in less than four, you are

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.890
going to learn how to take the things that

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.930
Android can do really well and leverage those opportunities to

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.850
make amazing experiences for your users. But, more generally what

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.160
I think's going on here is, you should know as

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.080
a designer, what you are uniquely positioned to do

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.650
well. No matter what you're designing. And then you should

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.570
do that thing well. In these massive classes that we've

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.290
been making for a while now, we've realized that one

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.050
thing we are uniquely positioned to do

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.640
well is leverage this amazing, massive body of

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.520
enthusiastic, diverse, intelligent students who are all thinking

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.590
and doing projects about the same sort of

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.200
stuff. And that's, that's a really huge

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.240
learning opportunity. So when we ask you to

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.120
write something down or share something in the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.440
forum. That's, that's why. We want you to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.500
not only learn from the writing experience itself, but to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.470
share that with other students and read what other students

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.440
have to say. This, this sort of social learning is

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.230
a really potentially important part of the online learning experience
