00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.930
If we plug negative 3 into the function for x, we end up with negative 60 as a

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.974
value of the function. So this should be, based on what we've seen before, the

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:13.913
remainder that we get and we divide this by x plus 3. Let's see if it actually

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:17.586
works. And, sure enough, completing our long division, we get a remainder of

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:18.851
negative 60.
