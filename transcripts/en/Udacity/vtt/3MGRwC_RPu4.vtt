00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.097
Zero is not a natural number. For example,
when we think back to the kindergarten

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.948
teacher example, she does not start
counting her children starting with zero.

00:00:10.058 --> 00:00:15.420
She begins with one. You can think of the
natural numbers as counting numbers, and

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:21.503
when we count, we usually begin with the
number one not zero. But zero does have

00:00:21.503 --> 00:00:25.199
some things in common with the natural
numbers. We can talk about there being

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:30.827
zero of some kind of object like cupcakes.
When considered as a single group, zero

00:00:30.827 --> 00:00:35.818
and the natural numbers make up what we
call the whole numbers. So let's go over

00:00:35.818 --> 00:00:40.898
the two groups we have so far. First, we
talked about the natural numbers or the

00:00:40.898 --> 00:00:48.137
counting numbers, which are one, two,
three, and so on, all the way up to

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:59.646
infinity. So this includes a ton of other
numbers, too, like 89, 560, and 9,345,760

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:04.959
as well as every other number that we
could count from one up to infinity. The

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:09.973
whole numbers include all of these numbers
but also zero. So you can see that our

00:01:09.973 --> 00:01:14.735
sets of numbers are starting to build on
each other. Which of the following

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:18.868
sentences accurately describe the
relationship between the natural and the

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:23.030
whole numbers? Please select as many as
you think are correct.
