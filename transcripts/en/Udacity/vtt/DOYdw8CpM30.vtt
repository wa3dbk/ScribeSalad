&gt;&gt; Once you get this setup going, now we can move on to the next part, actually

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.238
drawing the tile. To do this, requires a couple of steps. First, we need to

00:00:08.238 --> 00:00:12.531
calculate the position in our game world that we want to draw the tile at. To do

00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:16.557
this we need to use a little bit of math magic based upon the tile ID within a

00:00:16.557 --> 00:00:20.781
tileset and the number of tiles across that the entire map is, as long as the xy

00:00:20.781 --> 00:00:24.690
size of each tile. By combining these things, we actually get a nice little

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.348
setup that tells us the number of pixels x and y offset from the origin of the

00:00:28.348 --> 00:00:30.986
canvas to draw this tile. Now, you make that happen.
