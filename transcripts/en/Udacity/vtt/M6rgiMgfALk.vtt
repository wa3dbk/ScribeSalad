00:00:00.067 --> 00:00:03.782
So for our next version, let's parallelize this per element, right?

00:00:03.782 --> 00:00:07.474
So we essentially replaced the inner loop with a thread launch.

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.631
Let's replace the outer and inner loops with a thread launch.

00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:13.550
And I'm going to leave this as a programming exercise for you to do.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.828
We'll give you the same code that we've been using here

00:00:15.828 --> 00:00:18.936
with a little bit more instrumentation that should be pretty obvious.

00:00:18.936 --> 00:00:22.292
Go ahead and run this code, verify the timings.

00:00:22.292 --> 00:00:26.361
They might be different on whatever GPU and system you're running on.

00:00:26.361 --> 00:00:28.667
And then add a new kernel,

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:33.400
which performs the transpose on a per element basis and see how it times out.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.806
Now one thing to be aware of when you're doing this programming exercise

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:43.194
is that you can only launch up to a 1,024 threads in a thread block,

00:00:43.194 --> 00:00:46.861
so I suggest you organize your code to use K by K thread blocks,

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.745
multiple thread blocks, each of dimension of K by K,

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:52.355
and use a value of, like, 16 for K for now.

00:00:52.355 --> 00:00:56.000
We're going to play around with this value a little bit later.
