Your answer here can actually be any number of things. As long as the

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:08.366
coordinates that you pick, x and y, can be substituted into this equation and

00:00:08.378 --> 00:00:12.898
make it true, they should work. We can play around in the graph to find a few of

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.405
those points. Keeping in mind the scale of either of our axes, we can go over 1,

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:21.937
and down 2 from our y intercept of course, to find the point 1,8. We can do that

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.648
again, to the right 1, down 2, and that gives us 2,6. We can keep doing the same

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.169
thing, over and over again. We probably want to move in the other direction as

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:35.509
well. If we reverse what we are doing in x, so we move to the left instead of

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.657
right, then we need to do the opposite in y as well. So we need to move up,

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:44.731
instead of down. So to the left 1, and then up 2. That gives us negative 1,12,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.377
and so on and so forth. Once you draw enough of these points it's time to

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:52.162
connect them with a line.
