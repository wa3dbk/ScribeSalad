In the previous exercise I modified the drinking bird's geometry itself a bit

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.816
from the original model. I'm going to let you use your detective skills to

00:00:07.816 --> 00:00:13.494
figure out what I've changed. Which part has slightly different geometry; the

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:18.228
hat, head, the body bulb, or the legs and feet? Once you figure out what part

00:00:18.228 --> 00:00:23.098
has changed. Think about why I modified it. I won't test you on this. Sadly, the

00:00:23.098 --> 00:00:27.238
computer can't grade essay questions yet. But there's an interesting reason. By

00:00:27.238 --> 00:00:31.270
the way, even if you're not doing the exercises, you should be able to look at

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.573
the exercise code and see what's changed.
