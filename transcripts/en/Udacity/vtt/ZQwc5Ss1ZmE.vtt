00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.760
Here, have a couple questions for you. First, if you haven't ridden a bike in

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.790
years, but when you get on it you remember exactly how to ride it, what types

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.160
of memory are activated? But then you remember the first time you ever rode a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.549
bike. What type of memory is activated here? Finally, little random but, where

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:23.540
are the Great Pyramids? What type of memory is activated when you recall this?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.594
Take your time, but for the question, if you have not ridden a bike in years.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.714
But when you get on one, you remember exactly how to ride it, what types of

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:35.945
memory are activated? Type in two answers. And then for the next question, you

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:40.404
remember the first time you ever rode a bike. What type of memory is this? Just

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:44.586
choose one type of memory. And finally, where are the Great Pyramids? What type

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:48.884
of memory is activated here? Again, choose one. Here are four options to type

00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:53.715
in the boxes. Episodic, implicit, declarative, and procedural.
