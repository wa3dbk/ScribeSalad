The function will pass through these points here, and these points here. It

00:00:03.948 --> 00:00:07.910
won't be at all in this part of the graph, or in this part of the graph.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.595
Interesting. Slant asymptotes really change things up. Now since this is a

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:15.341
major tease, let me just show you the full graph of the function. And here it

00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:19.788
is. We can see our slant asymptote right here. The graph is getting closer and

00:00:19.788 --> 00:00:24.436
closer to it, as x gets bigger on both sides, positive and negative. And we can

00:00:24.436 --> 00:00:27.930
also see our vertical asymptote right here. Pretty cool. Asymptotes clearly are

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.800
what determines the behavior of rational functions.
