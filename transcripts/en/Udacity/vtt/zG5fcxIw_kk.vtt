00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.280
Now let's analyze the security of the
Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.720
First, we observe that the shared key,
meaning the shared secret,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.410
that is computed by both users A and
B, itself is never transmitted.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.490
Further, the local secret of user A or
B itself is also not transmitted.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.260
That is, the local secret,
XA, is kept to user A, and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.300
the local secret, XB, is kept to user B.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.820
In summary,
no secret value is being transmitted.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.300
On the other hand, the values you and
YB are transmitted.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.900
Then the question is from you which is
alpha raised to the power of XA mod q.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.750
And given that alpha and q and

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.220
you are known can
an emissary compute xa?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.590
The security assumption here,

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.310
is that this grid algorithm when large
number is involved is very hard.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.160
That is given y, alpha, and
q, it is extremely hard to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.680
compute the value of x, or
it is not practical to compute x.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.680
Because q is a very large prime.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.900
For example, q is a least 300 bit long.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.240
On the other hand,
if this conjecture is not true,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.700
that means an adversary knowing you and
knowing alpha and q,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.910
can easily compute xa which is
the local secret to user a.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.822
This would mean that
the adversary can compute

00:01:37.822 --> 00:01:42.660
secret key as they're shared between
user A and B, just like user A.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.440
Because now, the adversary knows
the local secret of user A.
