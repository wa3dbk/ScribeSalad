00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.959
Now let's say that you live in a city where it rains a lot, all day every day.

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:09.626
So, in this case, we're not going to have frequency here, we're going to have

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:14.852
precipitation. And it rains about the same amount, and the average rainfall is

00:00:14.852 --> 00:00:20.343
about the same every month. So, we can just summarize our distribution with a

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:26.177
line, and then we have what we call a uniform distribution. So where does the

00:00:26.177 --> 00:00:29.249
mode occur here, or, is there no mode?
