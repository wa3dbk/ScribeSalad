00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.990
Thank you, Professor.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.120
So I am back with more Python and
more graphs.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.630
This time, let's scatter some data.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.730
I mean,
let's learn how to build a scatter plot.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.640
We will compare scatter plot of
SPY versus XOM and SPY versus GLD.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.810
So let's read this data and
compute daily returns as well.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.510
As usual, We call get_data
function with this symbols and

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.360
also compute daily returns.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.810
Next we first plot scatter plot for
SPY versus XOM.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.780
Kind parameter of the plot
function of the data frame

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.970
will help us achieve this.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.580
So we mention we need a scatter plot,
but

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.430
since the data frame daily return
has values for three stocks.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.870
We have to mention which should be our
X axis and which should be our Y axis.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.922
As we are plotting SPY versus XOM,

00:00:53.922 --> 00:00:58.960
we assign X attribute aas SPY and
Y attribute as XOM.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.080
Ready to see the output?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.230
This is our SPY versus XOM.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.160
Now let's similarly plot SPY versus GLD.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.480
Since we want GLD on our y-axis, we just
replace the y label from XOM to GLD.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.010
So here are two scatter plots.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.800
SPY versus XOM and SPY versus GLD.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.880
But we want to recreate
the graph that Professor drew.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.660
So we fit a line to the scatter plots.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.990
For that, we need the help of
another good friend of ours.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.290
Which is numpy.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.295
So let's import it.

00:01:33.295 --> 00:01:37.447
After importing the numpy library
we areall set to fit a line to our

00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:38.440
scatter plot.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.510
So we have a set of points, and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.580
we want a line which has
an equation of degree one.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.900
So we go ahead and
fit a polynomial of degree one.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.140
This is what polyfit
function of the numpy does.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.940
So let's use it.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.010
We will first do it for SPY and XOM.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.300
The polyfit function needs x-coordinates
and y-coordinates to fit a line.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.910
For us the x-coordinates
are the daily return values for

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.419
SPY and the y-coordinates are daily
return values for the XOM.

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.490
The one denotes the degree
of our function.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.160
Calling this function
will return two things.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.590
The first is the polynomial coefficient
and the second is the intercept.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.390
Since we have a polynomial of degree 1,
it would be of the form y = mx + b.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.990
So m is the coefficient and
b is the intercept.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.840
We name them as beta and alpha.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.260
Just as Professor explained.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.010
Now we finally plot these values.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.540
The idea for plotting the line is,
for every value of x that is SPY,

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.160
we find a value of y using the line
equation, which is mx + b.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.130
This parameter denotes that we want
a line plot with the color red.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.310
Now, let's check our graph.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.530
Here is the fitted line.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.510
Let's do it for GLD so
that we can compare them both.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.610
We also print the beta and
alpha values for each.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.470
Now, let's compare the beta values

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.380
which shows how the stock
moved with respect to SPY.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.540
You can see that the beta values for

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.170
the XOM is greater as
compared to that of GLD.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.720
Which means that XOM is more reactive
to market as compared to GLD.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.710
On the other hand,

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.100
the alpha values denote how well
it performs with respect to SPY.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.410
Numbers over here say that
GLD performed better.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.130
Let's cross check.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.010
You can see the upward movement of
the GLD as compared to the SPY.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.560
One last thing is to find
the correlation yet again.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.740
The data frame has a function
corr which means correlation, and

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.030
we can define which method to use.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.280
We use the method pearson.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.290
It is the most commonly used method
to calculate the correlation.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.770
There are other methods as well, check
the instructor's note for more detail.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.710
We get the output in the matrix format,

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.260
with correlation of each
column with each other column.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.560
You can see that the SPY and
XOM are highly correlated.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.660
The value of the correlation for
GLD and SPY is very small.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:24.649
Let's check the graph.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.590
You can observe that the dots
do not fit the line closely.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.998
And that's why the correlation value for

00:04:32.998 --> 00:04:38.520
the SPY versus GLD is less as
compared to SPY versus XOM.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.450

frame scatter plot and polyfit,
