00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Here's the answer.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We're going to define a procedure, so we use the def followed by the name.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We'll use the name square, followed by the left parenthesis,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.754
and now we need to decide what the parameters are.

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:13.831
And remember when we define procedures, we should always be thinking about

00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:15.754
what the inputs are and what the outputs are.

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:17.769
In this case, the input is one number.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.000
We see in our example, it was the number 5.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We can give that any name we want.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
N is usually a good name for a number.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.554
So we'll use (n) and then we have the colon,

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:28.754
and now we're ready to define the body of square.

00:00:28.754 --> 00:00:32.000
What we want square to compute is the square of the number,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.815
so we want to multiply n by n, and that's the output.

00:00:34.815 --> 00:00:36.000
We can do everything with 1 statement.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's going to be a return statement where the expression that we're returning is n times n.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We want to get the value of n squared, and that's what we return.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Here's how that looks in the interpreter.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We're defining square. Our body returned n * n, and we're going to print the result of square (5).

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
We get 25. We can use a variable.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.846
Let's say, x has the value 37.

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:00.000
We can print the result of square (x).

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.800
We get a bigger number that's 37 x 37,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.000
and we could also do this.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Let's say we assign y the result of square (x),

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and then let's print the result of squaring y.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
That will give us 37 squared, and then we're going to square it again.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That gets quite a large number--1.8 million or so.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We could do those compositions without variables.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We could do this directly.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.385
We could print the square of the square of (x),

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.000
so we're calling square twice here.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The first time we're passing in 37,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
then we're getting the output of that, and then we're passing it in to square again.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is called procedure composition.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is the way most programs are written, that we're going to write little procedures.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Each procedure is going to take some inputs and produce some output,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But then we're going to use the outputs that we get the first time we use a procedure

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.846
as the inputs to the next procedure.

00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.277
In this case, we only have 1 procedure defined,

00:01:49.277 --> 00:01:52.000
so I've used square twice.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.015
When we run this, we see the value of 37 squared,

00:01:55.015 --> 00:01:56.669
which is quite a big number.

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:59.600
We'll see lots more examples of how we can compose procedures

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.000
using the outputs of 1 procedure as the inputs to the next procedure

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to get lots more interesting things done,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and you'll write some procedures that do that yourself pretty soon.
