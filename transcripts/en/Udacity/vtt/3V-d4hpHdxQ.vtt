I really like what Dave says in this
lesson called Variables Can Vary, and

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.330
I want to keep a record of the code
that he writes in this video.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.340
So I'm actually just going to write
it myself in my starter code file.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.720
And after I copy the code,
I'm going to add some comments

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.990
that tell me what this code is
all about and why it's important.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.100
I think I'll even include a link
to the video so I can go back and

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.760
reference it later.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.640
In Python, you can add notes to a code
file by using the pound symbol.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.196
Basically, that tells the computer
to ignore everything on that line

00:00:38.196 --> 00:00:43.034
after the pound symbol, so this way
I can write stuff that is meant for

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:45.720
people to read instead of computers.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.789
When I come to a quiz node I can
choose to switch to my browser and

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.251
answer the quiz in the Udacity classroom
or I can write my answer in my

00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:59.210
starter code file and just copy and
paste it over when I'm ready to submit.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.470
I think I'll do that.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.640
That way I can keep a record of my
quiz code just for my own reference.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.390
Awesome, I passed the quiz.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.530
If I ever want to see
what any of my code does,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.300
I can easily do that in Sublime.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.120
All I have to do is go up to
the menu bar, click tools and

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.500
then go to build, or as a shortcut,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.070
I can press Cmd+B on Mac or
Ctrl+B on Windows.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.600
When I click build, a screen shows on
the bottom of my Sublime window and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.010
it shows the output of my code.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.940
Doing this often will really help me
get into the habit of running my code.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.640
And it will help me a lot when I
start working on big projects.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.060
All right, this is looking pretty good.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
I'll save this file on my computer
in a place where I'll keep

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.950
all of my Intro to
Programming Nanodegree starter code.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.940
Now you can easily open this file and
check it out again.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.810
If I forget any of this content or

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.660
I just want a reference to
stuff that I've written before.
