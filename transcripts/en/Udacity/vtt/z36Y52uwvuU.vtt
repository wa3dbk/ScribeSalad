00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.570
In this lesson we added 
new activities to our apps

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.370
and explored ways to structure 
and navigate between them.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.860
And that meant learning 
all about intents

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.330
and how they're used in Android. 
Next up in Lesson 4, we're gonna

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
learn about the activity life cycle 
and make our apps

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.990
that much more useful by saving data. 
We'll began to databases

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.670
and learn about content providers, 
but first let's take another journey

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.320
into the history of Android.
