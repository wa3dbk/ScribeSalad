00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
So the original running time here was O(n&lt;i&gt;V) since the V was this value here and now&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.700
since we scaled it down using this factor here what we now have to do is we have

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:24.640
to replace V by V/V/n(1-c), which is the same as O(n²&lt;i&gt;1/1-c), which is the same as this one here.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, of course, in order to be very correct here, we have to constraint c so that it cannot be 1;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.750
otherwise, this running time here would be undefined--well, that's okay.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.810
As you will soon see that actually makes quite a lot of sense.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.660
So you've seen that we now have made the running time independent of V

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.720
and that is of course a very cool thing because V originally was what could make this algorithm

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.110
run in exponential time and now we can use this factor 1-c here to control the running time.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.400
So the running time will, of course, again become exponential if c becomes very close to 1,

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.210
but it will be polynomial if for example we set c to 0

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.879
and something in between when we set c to other values.

00:01:04.879 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, I still haven't told you what the c here is going to be about, but we'll soon figure that out.
