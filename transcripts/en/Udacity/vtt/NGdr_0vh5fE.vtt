00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now I'd like to ask you if you can find a more general pattern for the correction factor

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
for the variance calculation on a sample.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a challenging question.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The one example you did before may not have been enough for you to figure this out,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so feel free to do more examples with different size samples

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to see if you can figure this out.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Choose one of the following as the correction factor.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Is it n, n + 1 over n, n over n + 1, n divided by n - 1, n - 1 divided by n,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
or is it n squared - 1 over n - 1?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Recall that n is equal to the number of data points in the sample.

00:00:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Select the right answer.
