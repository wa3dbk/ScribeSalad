We just saw that in order to reflect points in the x axis, we need to switch

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.965
any y coordinates to negative y. And in fact, this is exactly what we do with

00:00:09.965 --> 00:00:14.812
functions as well. So for example, if we start out with the function we were

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:19.966
looking at before, y equals the root of x. Then in order to reflect this in the

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:23.810
x axis, we need to switch y to be negative y, which will gives us the equation

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.182
negative y equals the square root of x. What I'd like you to do is to rewrite

00:00:29.182 --> 00:00:33.192
this equation. Negative y equals the square root of x, so that y is all by

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:38.506
itself on the left hand side of the equation. So you'll end up with y equals

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:41.269
something. What goes on the right hand side?
