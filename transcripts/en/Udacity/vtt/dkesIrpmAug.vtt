00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.940
Now that we know how to save,
we're pretty much set.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.710
One thing to keep in mind though
as we mentioned before is that

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.450
when you save this is where
what you're saving is validated

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.420
against the data model you've created.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.490
So this means if the object you're
saving doesn't have everything the model

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.400
says it should or it doesn't fit
the model's description of what it

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.150
should be,
you'll be looking at an app crash.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.100
This is where it's important
to recheck your model and

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.030
make sure things match up.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.210
&gt;&gt; One of the most common places for
this issue to arise is with deletion.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.110
Let's take a look at our model again.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.960
The deletion rule for our notebooks
notes relationship is cascade.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.300
This means it will delete
all the associated notes.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.140
That sounds reasonable.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.580
If we look at the inverse relationship

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.270
that notebook relationship with a note
the deletion rule is nullified.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.340
This means that when a note is deleted,

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.630
all the references to it are removed or
made no.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.660
The notebook just
forgets about that note.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.660
This also sounds reasonable.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.820
But what if by mistake, we set the note
deletion rule to cascade also?

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.150
Then if we delete a notebook, core
data it will try to delete the notes.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.400
However, if the note
deletion rule is cascade,

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.040
core data will then try to
delete the notebook again.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.010
Trying to delete an object twice
is a sure recipe for an app crash.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.720
This is a very common beginner mistake,
so

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.960
make sure your deletion
rules make sense.
