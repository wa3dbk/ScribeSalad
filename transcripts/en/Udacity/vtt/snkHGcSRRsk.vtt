Here's my answer--build link index.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I created a dictionary--an empty dictionary--called index,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and then I iterate over the list of links for l and links.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And then I update the index l.id=l,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and then I return that index.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So let's give this a quick run to make sure it works.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, I'm going to just call this function and print the result.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
That looks about right.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
At least the first one looks good.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It maps 0 to the link with ID 0.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay, good enough for me. All right, let's move on.
