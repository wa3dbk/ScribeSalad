00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.923
Another way to show relative frequencies is with percentages. Percentages are

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:09.877
really nice because I, and many other people maybe including you, don't like to

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.179
work with decimals and fractions. If we use percentages for relative

00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:18.600
frequencies, we can work with whole numbers. A percentage is basically a

00:00:18.612 --> 00:00:23.750
proportion Except we multiply it by 100 and we call it a percent. So here I

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:29.259
converted the proportion of students from Canada to a percentage. Why don't you

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:34.741
try a few? Change the proportion for China, Germany, and Japan from a proportion

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:35.817
to a percentage.
