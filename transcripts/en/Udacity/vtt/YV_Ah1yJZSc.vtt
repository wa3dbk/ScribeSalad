00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.070
That's a great question. So what do data scientists do?

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.680
I think it's it's really hard to to pinpoint exactly

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.140
what they do because it's going to be tailored to

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.130
their actual application area that they work. But in general, what

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.650
they do is they take data and they find meaning

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.870
in the data. And what the meaning is going to be

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.990
really geared towards is going to be the, the case

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.703
for what they would like to explain. So it could be

00:00:25.703 --> 00:00:27.823
that a particular company, if they are looking

00:00:27.823 --> 00:00:29.946
at a company or, or the project. If they

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:32.691
are looking for some, some particular signal or

00:00:32.691 --> 00:00:35.460
something. I think in general in my mind what

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.000
data science does is, is use is use this data. Data sciences uses data

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.240
to essentially explain and perhaps predict behavior

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.210
be it human behavior or even like, like, behavior of of of a more

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.780
machine generated system, anything could be like that.
