00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.720
So the next technique in Stratton's Optimization Taxonomy is called the scatter-to-gather transformation.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.743
Now most interesting computations involve a step

00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:12.860
where many input elements contribute to the computation of an output element.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.420
So in this example the elements labeled blue in the input array

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.633
are contributing to the blue element in the output array,

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:24.126
and the elements labeled green in the input array are contributing to the green in the output array and so forth.

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:28.131
And examples from you homework included blurring the image or computing a histogram.

00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:31.932
And sometimes, of course, the locations of the input elements

00:00:31.932 --> 00:00:34.710
that will contribute to particular output element

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.607
aren't know ahead of time like in a histogram example.

00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:40.649
And we've talked about the difference between scatter and gather.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.845
In scatter the threads are assigned to the input elements,

00:00:43.845 --> 00:00:47.560
and each one is deciding where it needs to write.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.186
In gather the threads were signed to the output elements,

00:00:50.186 --> 00:00:53.428
and each one decides where he needs to go read from.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.846
So here's a quick quiz which should be pure review.

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:59.997
Which code snippet represents a gather, and which one will run more efficiently?

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:03.697
Here's code snippet 1, and here's code snippet 2.

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:06.117
In each of these cases you can assume that out and in

00:01:06.117 --> 00:01:10.300
are arrays of floating point numbers and that i represents the thread index.
