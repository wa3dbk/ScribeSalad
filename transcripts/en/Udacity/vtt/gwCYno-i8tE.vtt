00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Those are the main templates I used.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We'll give you all this code so you can reference it in future stuff.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Then here is the CSS I used to actually style the whole page.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
We don't cover much CSS in this class, but you can learn from what I've done here.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
On the body tag, I basically set the font to be Helvetica, font size 14.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I set the width to be 800, this margin--basically, this is the trick for centering content--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
added a little padding, make the color slightly off black--333 instead of 000.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We define when we use h2 we set it at font size 24, bold, some space on the bottom.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That's what margin bottom does. Errors are red.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Labels--we can make it a block element with font size 20.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This says if a label follows another label, put some space in between them--20 pixels.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This input type text formats our text box.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We make it width 500 pixels, font size 20, a little padding inside the box

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that just kind of spaces things out a little bit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I used a monospace font.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It makes it look like you're writing on typewriter or something.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Text area--again, I make it 500 pixels so it matches the input.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I make it 400 pixels tall so we get a nice actual box, 17 pixel font.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I make our submit button a little bigger.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is the main title of the page where it says CS253.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That's size 40 text. It's bold. It's centered. It's got some space below it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And it's actually a link to the front of the blog, but I don't want an underline there,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which is what HTML does by default when you have links,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so we can say text decoration None, which turns off that underline.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This says 15 pixels between two blog posts.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Post heading--now, this is the actual title of a particular blog post.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We've got that name. This adds that border, that line on the bottom.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Position relative is used for something else, which I'll show you in a sec.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Title--bold, 24 pixels tall.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The date the blog was submitted--this is position absolute.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
What position absolute let's you say is we want to position this 0 pixels from the right edge

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
of our parent, if that parent is position relative, which is why we have position relative here,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and 0 pixels from the bottom of that parent.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In this case we're making it color 999, which is kind of grey.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If we were to go back into our browser, this whole thing is the blog heading.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is the title, and this is that created data, which is position absolute,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
which is position 0 pixels from the right and 0 pixels from the bottom.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That's how we position that over here nicely on the right.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It's color 999, which is grey.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
That's just some basic CSS. I think there's just a little bit more.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The post content has 5 pixels on the top. That separates it from its heading a little bit.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You can see we've got that big text here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
When I mouse over it you can see my curser turns into a little hand, which means it's a link,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but I got rid of that underline.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Then you can see all the fonts we used here and the border bottom

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
we added here to make this line, and then the text in each of these posts.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You know, you don't have to understand that.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
You don't need to do it in any of our homeworks, because we can't grade easily

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the appearance of your things, but I like to do it so it looks slightly nicer.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So I figured I would show you how I did that.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That is it for homework 3. That was actually quite a bit.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
If you made it this far, good job. You are writing some serious web applications now.
