Well, when I tried it, I got 1.0E12, that's Java's way of using scientific

00:00:06.314 --> 00:00:16.372
notation. 1.0 times 10 to the 12th. That's a 1 with 12 zeros. So, in this case,

00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:20.950
changing from integers to floating numbers solved our problem. But it's not

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.519
always that simple.
