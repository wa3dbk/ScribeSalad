00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
This course has 7 units, and I'm now going to give you a brief overview of what we have planned.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.660
The first 3 units will introduce you to challenging problems,

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.350
and I'm going to do this by telling you about some problems

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.320
that are really relevant in practice, yet very, very hard to solve.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.790
We're also going to do a bit of the formal background of challenging problems

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.080
through a concept known as NP-completeness.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.330
And I'm going to show you how to recognize NP-completeness

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.930
so that you'll be able to develop an intuition when you encounter a challenging problem.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.500
So the first 3 units are basically about recognizing the hardness of a problem.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.030
In units 4 to 6 we are then going to discuss what to do if you encounter a hard problem,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.450
because, as I told you in the beginning, many people,

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
once they've recognized that their problem is hard to solve, actually tend to stop.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.710
And these units here will give you various techniques for solving hard problems.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.750
Solving them very exactly using techniques such as optimized search trees and pre-processing,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.840
but also solving them almost optimally using techniques such as approximation and randomization.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.670
So this will give you an aresenal of tools that you can use to try

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.140
and tackle any hard problem, should you encounter it.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.470
And then in the final unit we'll be going into computability and talk about unsolvable problems,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.820
problems that no computer can ever solve,

00:01:14.820 --> 99:59:59.000
and how you could solve them, nevertheless, if you come across them.
