00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Consider a website with 100,000 users.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
A thousand of those are highly active, and you want to take a survey.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now, to simplify this, let's assume that you draw the users at random

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that everyone responds.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If you send out 10 surveys, I'd like you to tell me the probability

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that the number of highly active users in our sample is greater than or equal to 2.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We have at least two of our highly actives in our sample of 10 surveys.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, remember that sometimes it may be easier to compute the probability

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of something being less than a given number,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and you can take 1 minus that and that is always going to be equal,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
since the probabilities always have to add up to 1.

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
