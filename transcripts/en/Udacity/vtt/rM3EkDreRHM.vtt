00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's start with N=1 and this involve different steps, you compute the standard deviation

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
as the square root of the variance you divide it by the square root of N

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and multiply with this funny factor 1.96--p(N-p) is 0.09--the square root is 0.3.

00:00:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
N=1 so it's 0.3&lt;i&gt;1.96 reveals a 0.588.&lt;/i&gt;
