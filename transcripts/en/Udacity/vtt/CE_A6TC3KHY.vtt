00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.844
Negative 10y to the 4th plus 8y cubed is the correct answer. That's some great

00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:07.406
work if you got it correct. If you got stuck somewhere, stay with me and then

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:11.054
pause it when you find a mistake and then keep going. This question involved

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:14.638
exponents and a negative term, so there are a couple of places where you might

00:00:14.638 --> 00:00:18.576
have gotten tripped up. I'm going to list this factor, 2y squared, on one side

00:00:18.576 --> 00:00:22.480
of a rectangle, then I'm going to have 4y, and negative 5y squared on the other

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.502
side of my rectangle. I'm going to consider this a positive region, because I

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:30.423
have a positive number times a positive number. I shaded this region orange,

00:00:30.423 --> 00:00:34.449
because we're going to wind up with a positive number, here's a positive times a

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.480
positive. For this region I've shade it grey because we have a negative number

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.409
times a positive number, we'll wind up with a negative area here. 2y squared

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.578
times positive 4y is 8y cubed. Next I have 2y squared times negative 5y squared,

00:00:49.578 --> 00:00:54.557
I'm finding the area of this part of my rectangle. I know a negative area might

00:00:54.557 --> 00:00:59.345
not make sense, but you can think about this area as the area that you have and

00:00:59.345 --> 00:01:03.683
this area, about the area that you owe. We use our properties of numbers to

00:01:03.683 --> 00:01:07.843
multiply 2 and negative 5, and our properties of exponents to get negative 10y

00:01:07.843 --> 00:01:12.005
to the fourth. Finally, we reverse the order or the two terms, to get our final

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.184
answer. Negative 10y to the 4th should be our first term, and positive 8y to the

00:01:16.184 --> 00:01:20.381
3rd should come second. Keep in mind, the signs in front of the terms stay with

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:20.726
them.
