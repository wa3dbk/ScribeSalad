00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.755
Accountable care organizations are a key
feature of the new Affordable Care Act,

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:10.210
whose design is in part derived from
the PGP demo we just discussed.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.940
There are currently a few hundred
ACOs being formed, or in operation.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.987
32 select pioneer ACOs are piloting
an even more advanced approach.

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:26.087
Like the Marshville Clinic,
pioneer ACOs must use advanced health

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:30.650
IT to manage entire populations
of patients in a coordinated

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.620
manner to electronically
exchange healthcare data.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.230
They must have the ability to
share performance feedback.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.010
They must provide a portal providing
access to patients to their own data.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.040
And they must have a demonstrated
ability to coordinate care.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.190
So which of the following is
the most advanced approach

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.314
to pay-for-performance?
