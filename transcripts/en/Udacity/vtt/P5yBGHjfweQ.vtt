00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.200
Here are the two models we've been looking at, and I'd like to know what each

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.470
of them estimates the world population would be by the year 2100. One of them

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.080
is going to give us a lower estimate, and one of them is going to give us an

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.820
upper estimate. So please tell me what each of those are. Once you figured out

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.100
those numbers, I'd like you to tell me which estimate you think is more

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.060
accurate and why. Or maybe both are inaccurate. Think about where the data that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.410
created each model came from.
