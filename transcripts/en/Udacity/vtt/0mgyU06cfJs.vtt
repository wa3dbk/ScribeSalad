Alright, so I have three and a half and I'm wondering how many times does

00:00:04.011 --> 00:00:07.806
four-fifths go into three and a half. I know that dividing by a fraction is the

00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:11.939
same thing as multiplying by a reciprocal, so I'm going to take three and a half

00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:16.390
and multiply it by the reciprocal of four-fifths. The reciprocal of four-fifths

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:21.178
is five-fourths. Now I need to multiply these two fractions together. This three

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.114
and a half is a mixed number and doesn't help me. I'm going to change it to an

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:29.833
improper fraction. 2 times 3 is 6 and 6 plus 1 is 7. So I have seven-halves

00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:32.569
times five-fourths or 35 divided by 8. 7 times 5 is 35, 2 times 4 is 8. Now I

00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:38.152
want to change this back into a mixed number to figure out how many batches of

00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:44.566
brownies I can make. 8 goes into 35, 4 times as 8 times 4 is 32. And I'm left

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:48.943
with 3 extra pieces or three-eighths. So I can make 4 and three-eighths batches

00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:49.863
of brownies.
