00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.510
So, the last type of partners are actually key suppliers. There are two types of key suppliers.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.170
One which you actually outsource part of your company to a third party.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.140
It might be your accounting functions. It might be some of your sales.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.500
It might be something as simple as doctors looking at x-rays

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.730
are now done by trained technicians in India.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.680
It might be part of your supply chain for sub-assemblies or you might outsource

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.660
your entire manufacturing line, which we used to have here in the United States

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.690
to a third-party company much like Apple does with Foxconn

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.480
or your key suppliers might be traditional direct suppliers.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.690
They simply ship your components, raw materials, iron, and ore for you to make steel, etc.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.760
In the old days, we used to think of suppliers as not a partnership but just simply a cost to goods.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.990
Nowadays, we understand to get the most efficient use out of our resources,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.410
we really need a relationship that treats them like partners.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
We both need to be in this to win.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.260
We both need to understand that this is more than just a financial transaction.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.800
So, as your startup grows, start looking for partners where you are more than just a checklist

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.890
and they're just more of a source of material and try to establish long and lasting relationships.
