00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.320
Our solutions are negative 3 plus the square root of 2, or negative 3 minus the

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.060
square root of 2. Nice work for finding those two answers. We start by taking

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.252
the square root of both sides of our equation. So we'll have x plus 3 on the

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:18.607
left equal to plus or minus root 2 on the right. Then to isolate x or to solve

00:00:18.607 --> 00:00:22.885
for x, we'll subtract 3 from both sides to get x is equal to negative 3 plus or

00:00:22.885 --> 00:00:25.563
minus root 2.
