00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.690
Having to close or navigate the tab
to get the service worker to update

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.689
is a bit of a pain during development.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.482
But thankfully,
there are ways to make it easier.

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:12.043
I'm going to make a change to the
console look in the service worker, and

00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:14.998
then back in the page I'm
going to hit refresh.

00:00:14.998 --> 00:00:17.360
Now there's a new
service worker waiting.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.970
You can tell the difference here as the
active service worker has this red icon

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.240
and the waiting one is,
I don't know is that teal?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.520
You can tell I'm not a designer.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.915
It's waiting because the tab is
still using the active version, but

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.776
rather than close this tab or
navigate it to another origin,

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:36.090
I'm going to reload the page
while holding Shift.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.010
This loads the page but
bypasses the service worker.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.290
This behavior is part of
the service worker spec, so

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.640
it should work in any browser
that supports service workers.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.540
This is handy for two reasons.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.540
One, it's a quick way to test changes
that are unrelated to the service

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.270
worker, such as minor CSS changes.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.830
And two, because this tab is no longer
controlled by the service worker,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.450
it let's the waiting
service worker take over.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.129
We can see this in dev tools, the teal
service worker has progressed to active.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.780
Now if I refresh normally,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.290
the request goes through the new service
worker and we get the updated log.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.870
Now's probably a good time to
talk about this ERR_FILE_EXISTS

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.280
thing in the console there.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640
That's just Chrome saying it's
checked the service worker and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.550
there were no changes.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.500
Showing an error for this is a bug,
but it isn't breaking anything.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.181
Hopefully this bug will be fixed by
the time you go through this course.

00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:32.920
So, Shift+Refresh is an easier
way to get updates, but

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.940
Chrome's dev tools has
an even easier way.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.900
In the Sources tab, check out this
little service worker panel here.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.780
There's an option called,
Force update on page load.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.440
This changes the service worker life
cycle to be developer-friendly rather

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.110
than user-friendly.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.800
In this mode when you hit refresh,
rather than refreshing the page,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.340
it fetches a service worker, treats it
as a new version whether it's changed or

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.660
not, and let's it become active straight
away, and then the page refreshes.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.610
That means I can make a change to
the console log, say, Yo Everyone,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.670
and then back in the page hit refresh
and I get those changes straight away.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.800
No Shift+Refresh, no closing tabs.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.770
This change in behavior only happens
while dev tools is open, but

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.510
it makes viewing quick
changes really easy.

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.130
However, we need to bear in mind
it's not the same life cycle

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.060
users will be getting.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.860
Later in the course, we'll look at
optimizing the user experience, but

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.160
first, let's do some more exciting
things with the service worker.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.130
In the next chapter,
we'll look at hijacking requests and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.950
doing our own thing.
