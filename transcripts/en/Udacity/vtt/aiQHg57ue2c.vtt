00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.468
I find myself usually modifying the fragment shader in a program, since that's

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:07.486
where all the per pixel processing is happening. Let's back up a bit and show

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:11.738
how various parameters were produced by the vertex shader. The position and

00:00:11.738 --> 00:00:15.548
normal of the vertex are passed in with these names, position and normal. A few

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.139
built in matrices are used for transformation, namely projectionMatrix,

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:23.602
modelViewMatrix and normalMatrix. In Three.js, these are always available to

00:00:23.602 --> 00:00:28.020
the shader if desired. In WebGL itself you need to do a little more work.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.792
There's currently not a modelViewProjectionMatrix of these two matrices

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:34.354
multiplied together. Maybe you'll be the person to add it to Three.js, as it's

00:00:34.354 --> 00:00:38.540
commonly used and would be more efficient to use here. What we get out of this

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.455
shader are a few vectors. First the gl.Position is set, which is the location

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:46.700
in clip coordinates. This vector must always be set by the vertex shader, at a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.114
minimum. One of the features of the vertex shader is that you can change the

00:00:50.114 --> 00:00:53.613
shape of an object. You can't really change it in the fragment shader. The

00:00:53.613 --> 00:00:58.400
normal in modelView space is computed here, using the normal transform matrix.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.487
Finally, a vector from the location in modelView space toward the viewer is

00:01:01.487 --> 00:01:05.025
computed. First the position in modelView space is computed, and then negating

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:07.798
this vector gives the direction toward the viewer from the surface, instead of

00:01:07.798 --> 00:01:12.210
from the viewer to object. Remember that the camera's at the origin in View

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.970
space. We don't really need the temporary mvPosition vector. We could have

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.482
combined these last two lines of code. This example is here to show how to

00:01:19.482 --> 00:01:22.676
compute it. To sum up, the vertex shader took as inputs the model space

00:01:22.676 --> 00:01:26.860
position and normal. It transformed them to create a point in clip coordinates

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.264
for the rasterizer. It also transformed the normal and position. The resulting

00:01:31.264 --> 00:01:34.037
transform vertices are then interpolated across the triangle during

00:01:34.037 --> 00:01:38.159
rasterization, and sent to the fragment shader for each fragment produced.
