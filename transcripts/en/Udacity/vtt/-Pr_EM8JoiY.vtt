00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.172
I could figure these first three out on my own without a calculator, just by

00:00:03.172 --> 00:00:07.601
using the method we've been using. I rewrote each of the numbers we wanted to

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:13.006
take the log base 10 of as 10 to some power. 1 is 10 to the 0, so that gave us

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:20.360
0. 10 is 10 to the 1, so taking its log in base 10 gives us 1. And log base 10

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.732
of 100 equals 2. However, I don't know how to write the number 2 or the number

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:31.079
20 or the number 200 as 10 to some power. So for these, I need to use my

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.901
calculator, let's try one of them out. How about the first one? So, log base 10

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:42.540
of 2 equals this long decimal. I'm going to round to the fifth decimal place.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.501
Entering the last two problems on the calculator, gives me long decimals as

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:53.469
well. Log base 10 of 20 is 1.30103, about. And log base 10 of 200 is about

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.364
2.30103. Please remember, these are rounded answers.
