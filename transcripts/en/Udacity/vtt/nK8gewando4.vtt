00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.670
So now that we have seen how the 1-BIT History works, Let's do a quiz about

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.902
that. So we have 1-aof history and a

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:11.650
2-bit counter per history. And the pattern we

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.820
will try to predict is the not-taken, not-taken,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.267
taken and then that repeats. This is a

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.622
regular expression, so BIT match is not-taken, not-taken,

00:00:20.622 --> 00:00:25.285
taken, not-taken, not-taken, taken, etc. The 1-bit history,

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:30.982
is 0 at the beginning. The 2- BIT counters both start at the strong

00:00:30.982 --> 00:00:36.720
not taken state. And the question for you is, after 100 repetitions of this

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.280
pattern, so there are 300 outcomes. NNT, and that repeats 100 times. What is the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.670
overall number of mispredictions that we will have seen? Write that number here.
