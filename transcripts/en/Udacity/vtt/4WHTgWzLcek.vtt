00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.640
Traditionally, the standards
community often seeks standards for

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.930
virtually everything.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.410
So it should not be surprising
that there is an HL7 standard for

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.000
developing HL7 standards.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.890
It's called the HL7 Development
Framework, or HDF for short, and

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.130
is diagrammatically shown here.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.570
For the purposes of
this overview course,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.010
it is sufficient to know that it exists.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.840
And to be familiar with
these linked circles

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.410
showing the standards
development process.
