00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
All right, so let's take a look at how I decide to do this.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.830
Like I said, you set up a second vertex called u and set it to equal to -1.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.350
In other words, it's not set to any actual vertex in the graph at first.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:21.580
So for every single element in the upper triangular portion of the adjacency matrix

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.800
since we're presenting this as an adjacency matrix,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.440
we check if there is an edge between those two vertices between vertices I and J.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:37.540
And if there is, then we check if the assignment for I and J is zero

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.380
that is they're not none anymore, we have specifically set them to not be in the assignment.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.250
Well, if both of them are explicitly out of the assignment and there's an edge between them

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.640
well then that's not going to be a valid vertex cover, so we return float infinity.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.890
Now, otherwise, if we find that the assignment for both I and J is equal to none,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.300
then that means we haven't actually look at this yet, so it's a good candidate for setting v and u--

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.930
so that we set u equal i and v equal to j and we continue on.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:18.010
Now, once we go through the entire double for loop, we check if v is still on set.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:24.970
If v is still on set, that means first of all we didn't fall out of this by not having a valid vertex cover

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.250
and second of all, it means that all the vertices have been assigned to something rather

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.930
because that's the only way that v could still be set to -1

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.930
and if v is set to -1, then note that u also is.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.620
Now, if that's the case, then we set a variable size equal to zero

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.740
and we start simply counting up all of the different vertices in the assignment.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.500
If the vertex is set in the assignment, then we increment size.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.480
It it's still unset, well then we have to do a little bit of manipulation here.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.780
We'll just set the vertex i to 1 if a neighbor is zero

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.960
because we want to make sure that this is still a valid vertex cover.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.890
So, for every j in range i--well, I just realized I put an i in here.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.920
Well, then there are unnecessary just a slight inefficiency,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.970
you can boost this to i+1 since we don't allow any loops in the graph.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.290
If we did, then we would have to simply use i but this doesn't really particularly matter for this.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:37.090
Moving on, so for every other vertex in the graph, we check if there is an edge between i and j again

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.810
and if there is and if the assignment of j is zero, well then, we have to set i

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.990
and we say that the size is an additional element because we now have to set i,

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.910
and once we go through all this, we return the size and that's done.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.560
Now, for each of these for the recursive part that you don't have to worry about,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.250
we try all the different possible combinations that aren't zero-zeros

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.720
since that would not be a valid vertex cover.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.400
We try 1, 0; 0, 1; and 1, 1.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.120
We compute the size for each of these and then we return the minimum of those

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.170
and compute this whole thing recursively.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.920
So that was a little tricky. If you had trouble with that, totally understandable.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.670
This does give you a little bit of improvement in the total size

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.360
of the search tree we end up searching through.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.280
Before, it was 2 to the end--Now, we got about 1.733 to the end.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.570
It might not seem like much but in practice, it can be helpful.

00:03:42.570 --> 99:59:59.000
So, okay. Let's go ahead and look a different problem now.
