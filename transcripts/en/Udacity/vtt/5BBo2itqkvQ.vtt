00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.100
Okay.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.480
So, here we have two frames.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.480
On the left we have the original model
the, the model is sort of a time and,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.500
and we're going to call that zero.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.530
And on the right we have some candidate.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.520
Something, some place in
terms of how its changed and

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.720
this can be centered at some value y,
some pixel y.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.720
So on the left,
we have our initial distribution.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.990
Okay.
So this was our

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.590
histogram that we computed, in our area,
and it's typically called q.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.500
And q's got a set of bins, u1 through m.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.130
And because it's going to
represent a density,

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.860
we enforce the fact that
sum of them equals one.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.900
So how do we do that?

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.310
Well we just sum them all up and
we divide all the bins by that value.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.880
Okay.
And

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.380
you see we have the audaciousness
to call it probability.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.390
Okay?
Because

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.460
well were going to take these samples
and we're going to assume that it's

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.220
representative of a probability
distribution function.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.250
So that's our distribution at
the initial of the target.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.310
At some new location.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.020
Okay.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.330
We can compute the distribution again.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.080
So now p of u is a function of y where
y is the point that we're considering.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.410
Remember you have to consider
p of z given the state.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.020
So y is going to be that,
that new point.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.880
And it's called y instead of x,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.364
that's how it's done in the Mean-Shift
Literature if you read this, this is,

00:01:18.364 --> 00:01:19.450
this is what you would see.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.230
And again,
were going to build a distribution

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.600
by assuming that these
things sum up to one.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.890
So we have this two distributions and
what we have to do is we need

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.840
a similarity function that compares
them, that compares the original

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.130
q and the new p of y which is
the density at this proposed place.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.570
So the question is how are we
going to compare these distributions?

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.120
Now there are a variety of functions
that you can use to compare histograms,

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.610
where the histograms, are,
are normalized to one, so

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.440
they represent probabilities.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.570
There's the min value.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.250
There's, there's chi-squared,
a variety of them.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.025
The one that was used with respect to

00:02:00.025 --> 00:02:04.640
Mean-Shift tracking is referred to
as the Bhattacharyya Coefficient.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.750
Bhattacharyya Coefficient comes
from something related to

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.940
the Bhattacharyya distance.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.070
It's simply a way of
comparing distributions.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.870
What you do is,
you take your distributions here, and

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.030
you change it by taking the square
root of each of the components.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.450
So, if q is a distribution,
q1 through qm, then

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.010
q prime is going to be the square root
of q1 through the square root of qm.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.970
Same thing with the new proposed
distribution, p, around y.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.420
We're going to take p prime,
where we take the square roots.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.210
When we define it that way,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.070
the Bhattacharyya relationship
is defined as follows.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.460
Okay?

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.020
Just take the sum over the product
of those square roots.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.090
Okay.
Well you might ask,

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.060
why would you do that.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.360
&gt;&gt; Why would you do that?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.490
&gt;&gt; Well you quickly realize that

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.220
if you take the magnitude of
those square rooted vectors.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.160
Right?

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.420
The magnitude is the square
root of the sum of the squares.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.820
Well, the sum of the squares is what?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.840
Well, since the sum of the qs is one,
the sum of the square roots

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.280
then squared is going to be one,
so the magnitude is one.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.050
So, these magnitudes here, those are
one, so that means you just have this.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.210
So basically you're
computing the dot product,

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.240
the cosine of the angle between
the square roots of those distributions.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.140
And that sum of the square root,
the thing in the box here,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.600
that's what's referred to as
the Bhattacharyya Coefficient.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.790
It's just a way of comparing
distributions, and so

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.500
that's what they did.
