00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.105
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Here's another equation, and this time it looks harder.

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:06.555
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have this negative 4 sitting outside these parentheses.

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:10.578
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, we only need to multiply this negative 4 to the terms inside the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.307
parentheses.

00:00:11.408 --> 00:00:13.032
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This is called distribution.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:17.183
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; When distributing the negative 4, I do negative 4 times x, and negative 4

00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:18.154
times negative 4.

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:22.213
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You want to make sure that you carry this sign in front of the second term

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:22.605
with it.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.306
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I've also been careful to write each statement out.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.918
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't want to make an error with negative signs.

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:29.240
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Finish this problem now.

00:00:29.334 --> 00:00:31.346
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What's the solution? What does x equal?
