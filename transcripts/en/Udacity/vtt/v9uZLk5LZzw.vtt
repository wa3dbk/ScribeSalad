00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.982
Let's take one last look at our drinking bird. This version is just key frames

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:07.560
and if you compare it to the real thing it's not very true to life. One element

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.291
we haven't animated at all is the fluid level in the bird itself. The

00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:14.680
distribution of fluid matters to how the bird swings in the real world.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.303
Simulating this effect would be a bit of work but once done properly would

00:00:17.303 --> 00:00:21.198
provide a true to life simulation of the physics of the situation. Perhaps the

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:23.510
discoverer of the drinking bird equation will be you.
