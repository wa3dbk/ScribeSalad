If you're familiar with C#,
you may have seen extensions before.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.860
Or if you've done any
work with Objective-C,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.950
you may have seen its analog
to extensions, categories.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.680
But for many of you,
extensions could be a brand new concept.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.860
Kind of like adding an extension to
a house, extensions offer a way to

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.180
add computed properties and methods to
an existing class, struct, or enum.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.210
They're often used to extend types for
which you don't have access to the code,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.180
like Apple Frameworks, or
third party libraries.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.660
I want to walk through an example that
I adapted from an example I found on

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.250
Andrew Bancroft's blog.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.700
Which by the way you should definitely
check out if you haven't yet.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.650
You can find a link to it
in the instructor's notes.
