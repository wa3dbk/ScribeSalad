Now are linear equations, the only kind of functions that can make up the

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.924
pieces of a piecewise function? Definitely not. We can go crazy and make each

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:13.000
section any kind of function we want. So, how about this graph? How would we

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.016
express the piecewise function that I've shown right here? Please fill in both

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:21.853
the function part in the domain part for each portion of the graph. Now when

00:00:21.853 --> 00:00:24.891
you do this, I'd like you to start at the top here with the left-most portion

00:00:24.891 --> 00:00:29.132
of the graph, and then work your way right. That way the values we see here in

00:00:29.132 --> 00:00:31.040
the domain are going to increase.
