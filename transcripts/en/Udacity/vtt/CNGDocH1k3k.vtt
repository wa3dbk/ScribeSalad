00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.450
An important point. Even though we can predict the price of

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.170
a diamond based on a function for c's. One thing you

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.020
should not conclude with this exercise is that where you buy

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.620
your diamond is irrelevant. You almost surely pay more for the same

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.610
diamond at Tiffany's compared to Costco. Regardless you can use a

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.670
model like this to get a sense of whether you were

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.000
overpaying. One last thing, data and models are never infallible and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.280
you can still get taken even equipped with this kind of analysis.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.430
There's no substitute for establishing a personal connection and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.890
lasting business relationship with a jeweler you can trust.
