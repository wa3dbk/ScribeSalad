00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.348
The product is 21 m cubed plus 15m to the 5th. Excellent work if you reasoned

00:00:04.348 --> 00:00:08.584
through that one. If you weren't sure where to start, always start with the

00:00:08.584 --> 00:00:13.087
rectangle. We know this is one number, so this can be one side of a rectangle.

00:00:13.087 --> 00:00:17.548
This is our second number. 7m squared plus 5m to the 4th. We want to split it up

00:00:17.548 --> 00:00:22.184
into 2 parts. Since we have 7m squared. Plus 5m to the fourth these would be

00:00:22.184 --> 00:00:27.075
different numbers. Think about if m were 2 this number would be 28 and this

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:31.985
number would be 90. But we really don't know what m is so, we have to leave it

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:36.958
with these expressions. Next we multiply 3m by each of the terms to find the

00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:41.826
area. 3m times 7m squared. Is 21m cubed. There's a 1 as the exponent on the m,

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:46.493
so remember to add the exponents when multiplying with the same base. Our two

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:51.225
numbers, 3 and 7, just get multiplied as usual. Next we multiply 3m times 5m to

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:55.665
the 4th, that will give us the area of this rectangle, 3 times 5 is 15, and m

00:00:55.665 --> 00:01:00.053
times m to the 4th, is m to the 5th. We don't have like terms here so we can't

00:01:00.053 --> 00:01:04.355
add these together. We have an area of 21m cubed and an area of 15m to the 5th.

00:01:04.355 --> 00:01:08.641
This is our total area. And instead of writing your entry like this, you might

00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:12.997
have listed your entry like this or rearrange the terms and written your answer

00:01:12.997 --> 00:01:17.308
like this. This one is actually preferred. It's in standard form because the

00:01:17.308 --> 00:01:21.236
highest exponent comes first. When writing your answers for the rest of this

00:01:21.236 --> 00:01:24.804
lesson, you'll want to write them in standard form. Variables are usually listed

00:01:24.804 --> 00:01:27.085
alphabetically, and the highest powers come first.
