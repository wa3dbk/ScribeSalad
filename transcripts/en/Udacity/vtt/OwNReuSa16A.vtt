00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.140
In this lesson we looked at Rational Functions that have horizontal and

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.396
vertical asymptotes and we also talked about how to find them. Get ready for

00:00:07.396 --> 00:00:10.202
the next lesson, where we'll learn how to find the domain and the range for

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:15.176
rational functions. Well also talk about one more kind of asymptote. So get

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:15.690
excited.
