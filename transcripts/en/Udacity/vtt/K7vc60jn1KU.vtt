00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.680
So, that's kind of just the motivation for the

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.460
simulating the Annealing Algorithm, but there's an actual algorithm and

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.540
it's, it's remarkably simple and remarkably effective. So, the algorithm

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.200
goes like this, for, we're just going to repeat for some

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.560
finite set of iterations. We're going to be at some

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.540
point x, and we're going to sample a new point

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.300
x of t, from the neighborhood of x. And then

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.450
what are we going to do? Well, we're going to move

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.860
our x to that x t, probabilistically. So

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.280
in particular, we've got this probability function pxxtt, which

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.520
is going to help us decide whether or not

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.340
to actually make the move. And it's, and, and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.610
the form of that function is written out

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.860
here. So, the probability that if we're currently at

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.680
x, and we're thinking about moving to x sub

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.670
t, little t, and the current temperature is capital

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.090
T, then what's going to happen? If the fitness of the new

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.430
point is bigger than or equal to the old point, we're

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.457
just going to make the move. Right? So we always hill climb

00:00:59.457 --> 00:01:02.230
when we are at a point where we can do that.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.560
&gt;&gt; So that's just rigorall hill climbing.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.650
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like hill climbing, exactly. It's a little different from

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.610
the hill climbing the way we described it, where we said let's

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.900
visit all the points in the neighborhood. This is kind of a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.470
useful thing to be able to do when the neighborhood's really large,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.320
just choose anything in the neighborhood, and if

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.890
it's an improvement, you know, go for it.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.270
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.290
&gt;&gt; But, what if it's not an improvement? Well

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.850
if it's not an improvement, what we're going to do is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.840
we're going to look at the fitness difference between the point

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.680
that we're evaluating, and the point where we are now.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.850
Look at the difference between those two, divide that by

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.800
the temperature, take E to that, and interpret that as

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.110
a probability. And we either make the move or not

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.542
with that probability. So, alright, so let's, we've gotta dive

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:42.654
in a little bit to this expression to make some sense out of

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:49.210
it. So, what happens, Charles, if the point that we currently visited x,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.890
then we visit a neighbor point X T, what if their fitnesses are

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.813
really close to each other, say you

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:55.680
know, just Infinitimally close to each other.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.030
&gt;&gt; Well, if they're infinitesimally close to one another, then

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.480
that means that difference is going to be very close to 0.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.595
&gt;&gt; Right, and so we get

00:02:05.595 --> 00:02:09.370
0 over doesn't matter what the temperature is, we get 0. E to the 0 is 1,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.984
so we make the move if it's you

00:02:11.984 --> 00:02:14.840
know, infinitesimally smaller than, than where we are now.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Alright, what if it's a, what if it's a big step down?

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.820
&gt;&gt; Well, then, that means that number's really, really, negative.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.010
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.374
&gt;&gt; And the negative divided by some positive number T is

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:28.060
the temperature, so T's always greater than or equal to 0.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.276
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:34.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's say that.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.690
&gt;&gt; In fact, probably making it equal to 0 could run

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.850
us into trouble. So let's just say that it's bigger this year.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.030
&gt;&gt; So it's Kelvin. So it's in Kelvin. Okay, so

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.100
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]. we, that'd be a really, really big

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.160
negative number, and E to a really big negative

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.010
number is 1 over E to a really big number. So that makes it very close to 0.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.560
&gt;&gt; Good, right. So, in other words, if

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.070
a giant step down, we probably won't take it.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.290
&gt;&gt; Right, okay, that makes sense, so you're sort

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.220
of smoothly going in directions that kind of look bad as a function of how

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.610
bad they look, and sort of exaggerating

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.852
that difference through an exponential function. [LAUGH] Right?

00:03:11.852 --> 00:03:15.610
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Sure. If, if that, if that gets you going.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.770
&gt;&gt; Well so 3 isn't 3 times worse than 1.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.620
It's you know, 2 to the 3 times worse than 1.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.360
&gt;&gt; I see, or E to the. Well so, so good, but let's, let's look

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.050
at one more thing with this equation here. let's,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.930
let's say that there's You know, a moderate step down.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.110
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. So, it's not so huge that when we divide it by T, it's essentially

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.260
negative infinity. Let's just say it's a smaller

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.980
thing, you know, - 5 or something like that.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.920
&gt;&gt; Then what, what happens? Now we get some E

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.370
to the that is going to be some probability between 0

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.850
and 1. What does the T, what does T do?

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.860
In this case. What if T is something really big?

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.370
What if, what if, what if T is something really small?

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.520
&gt;&gt; Well, T is something really big. Let's say, infinity then,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.020
it doesn't matter what the difference is. It's effectively going to be 0.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.680
&gt;&gt; Right, so really big temperature here means that we're going to have some

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.600
negative thing divided by something else. This

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.310
is going to be, essentially 0. It's going to

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.165
be E to the 0, so it's going to be 1. So, when the temperature's

00:04:10.165 --> 00:04:12.388
really high, we're actually willing to take

00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:13.980
downward steps. So, we don't even sort

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.150
of notice that it's going down.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.265
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:17.190
&gt;&gt; There's lots of randomness happening.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.519
&gt;&gt; Right. So, in fact, if key is infinity, it's really, really, really,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.680
really hot then even if the neighbor, is much, much worse off. He'll

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.950
be less worse off than, infinity, and so, basically you're always just going to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.810
jump to the next person. To the next neighbor. To the next point.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.700
&gt;&gt; Right. So we're very likely to accept.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.240
So the, so it's going to move freely. If

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.090
T is really small, as T approaches 0

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.970
what happens? Well let's just take the extreme

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.750
case. So T was 0 or effectively 0,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.800
then that means any difference whatsoever basically becomes infinity.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.340
&gt;&gt; Right, it gets magnified by this very, very small T.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.180
&gt;&gt; Right. And so then it's not going to take

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.940
any downwards steps. It's only going to go uphill. Yeah, so

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.930
that's kind of the essence of the Similarity Annealing Algorithm,

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.875
so maybe we can talk about some of its properties.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:04.474
&gt;&gt; OK.
