00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.180
Before we wrap up our work with the pseudo-Facebook data, let's hear from Dean

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.200
again about another technique that you can use in your work as a data analyst.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.540
&gt;&gt; Much of the analysis we've done so far

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.730
focused on some pre-chosen variable, relationship or question of interest.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.500
We then used EDA to let those chosen variables speak

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.740
and surprise us. Most recently, when analyzing the relationship between

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.740
two variables we look to incorporate more

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.850
variables in the analysis to improve it. For

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.670
example, by seeing whether a particular relationship

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.760
is consistent across values of those other variables.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.170
In choosing a third or fourth variable

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.350
to plot we relied on our domain knowledge.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.450
But often, we might want visualizations or

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.600
summaries to help us identify such auxiliary variables.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720
In some analyses, we may plan to make

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.180
use of a large number of variables. Perhaps,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.230
we are planning on predicting one variable with

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.630
ten, 20, or hundreds of others. Or maybe

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.040
we want to summarize a large set of variables

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.910
into a smaller set of dimensions. Or perhaps,

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.030
we're looking for interesting relationships among a large

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.610
set of variables. In such cases, we can help

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.780
speed up our exploratory data analysis by producing many plots

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.570
or comparisons at once. This could be one way to let

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.080
the data set as a whole speak in part by drawing

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.350
our attention to variables we didn't have a preexisting interest in.
