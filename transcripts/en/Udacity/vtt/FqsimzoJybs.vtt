00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So the answer is we don't need 20 multiplications; we only need 4.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the property we're taking advantage of is that X to the 2A is equal to X to the A squared.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
That means we can break 2 to the 20 down into parts--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
it's equal to 2 to the 10th squared

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which is equal to 2 to the 5 squared squared

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is equal to--now 2 to the 5 is not divisible by 2--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so that's equal to 2 to the 4 times 2 squared and squared.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And so the number of multiplications--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
well what we're computing is each square involves a multiplication--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so there's 1 multiplication there, there's 1 multiplication there,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
there's 1 multiplication there, and there's 1 multiplication there--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
so 4 total multiplications.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So this does not scale exponentially in the size of the power.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So this means computing A to the N power requires

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
on the order of log N multiplications.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In terms of the size of N, that means it's linear

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in terms of the number of bits needed to represent the power.
