00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay, so now you know the basic % s and how to include multiple variables.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's make it even more complex.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
What if we want to include the same string--the same variable twice

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or you want to not go insane trying to remember how many variables you've included

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and have to count % s's.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
There's a new syntax for that, and that looks like this.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Instead of saying % s, we can include in parenthesis a name, an identifier,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and then instead of including just variables at the end, we can include a dictionary

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that maps name to value,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and name can appear in the string multiple times, and we can have multiple names.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Let's have a quick quiz with that.
