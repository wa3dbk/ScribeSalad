00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.540
Let's look at the solution
to our MSI quiz.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.370
Read X results in the same
behavior as in the previous quiz.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.000
Both of them have the state as I, and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.350
then when read X occurs in C1's cache,
it sends out a read request,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.930
gets the block from memory, and now
it has the block in the shared state.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.510
C2 still has the block
in the invalid state.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:32.350
Now when C2 writes to X,
it sends out a write miss request.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.910
It will get the data and
then write to its cache, so

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.500
it gets the block now
in the modified state.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.060
C1 meanwhile transitions
from the shared state

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.980
to the invalid state because it
observes the write request sent by C2.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
And then when C1 wants to write,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270
it does pretty much the same
thing as C2 just did.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.420
It puts a write miss request on the bus,
gets the block,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.920
writes to it,
puts it in the modified state.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.680
Meanwhile, C2 has to intervene and
provide the data that C1 gets,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.988
and then, because we snooped a write, we
need to transition to an invalid state.

00:01:13.988 --> 00:01:18.195
Note that if a block is
in M state in any cache,

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:22.705
all the other caches have to have
that block in the invalid state.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:27.345
If a cache has a block in a shared
state, all the other caches need to

00:01:27.345 --> 00:01:31.305
have the block in either the shared or
the invalid caches.

00:01:31.305 --> 00:01:35.775
So, pretty much we can have one has M,
all other have I.

00:01:35.775 --> 00:01:40.252
Or we have several can have S and
the rest have I.

00:01:40.252 --> 00:01:44.390
We cannot have M and
S in the system at the same time for

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.190
the same block, and
definitely we can not have M M.
