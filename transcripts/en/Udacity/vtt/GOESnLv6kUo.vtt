00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.950
To solve this equation, we substitute the source color into here and the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.686
background color into here. And we multiply by the alpha in both cases. We get

00:00:09.686 --> 00:00:17.170
these intermediate results. And when we add them together, we get 0.90, 0.41,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.896
0.19. The demo that follows, shows the result of this particular exercise. Try

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.793
varying the alpha and the colors to see the effect.
