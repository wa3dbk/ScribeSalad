00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.100
Let's finally get back to helping Athena. She knows that she wants to build her

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.466
glasses frame logo using the shape of y equals x to the 4th. However, she wants

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:13.852
the center of her glasses frame to be at the origin. So, she's figured out she

00:00:13.852 --> 00:00:17.634
needs to move this function to the right and down one, to create the bottom

00:00:17.634 --> 00:00:23.544
half of the right side of the frame. That should give her this graph. So this

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:26.892
area right here will be the bottom of the right side of the frame, however we

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:32.152
need the equation of this function. Please write the right-hand side of the

00:00:32.152 --> 00:00:36.399
equation here, I've already given you the left-hand side, it's just y.
