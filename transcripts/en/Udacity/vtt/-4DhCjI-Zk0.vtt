00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.290
So I'm setting here with the founding CTO of Udacity, Mike.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.600
Mike, how did you come to the decision Udacity? Because Udacity is running their

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.450
courses own App Engine, in fact that's what this course is all

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.440
about. How did you come to the decision of, of using App Engine?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.530
&gt;&gt; The very first website we built was built

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.010
for AI classes, a single course. And it was

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.330
built on a bunch of VPS servers, and we

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
had underestimated the interest that we were going to get.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.700
Which was awesome, but we ended up with two

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.960
orders of magnitude more users than we expected. And

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.125
I was a relatively novice web developer. And so

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.969
we hit every single problem you can hit, in

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.287
terms of scaling up the infrastructure to meet the

00:00:48.287 --> 00:00:51.359
demand. And so the entire 14 weeks of the course

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.089
we were just playing catch up the whole time.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.787
Fixing problems, and adding more bandwidth, and adding more machines

00:00:57.787 --> 00:01:01.520
and memory. And coming out of that, we were looking

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.820
at launching a bunch more courses and we were really

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.910
uncertain about how much traffic we'd be getting. We've seen

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.156
a lot of peaks. And so one of the engineers,

00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:12.808
we're a very small team, but one of the engineers

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:16.580
had some experience using App Engine. And, it sounded like

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.122
a really great solution to the problem of uncertain amount

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:24.881
of load, and took all of that headache. Because we

00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:28.198
were spending about half of our engineering hours doing sys

00:01:28.198 --> 00:01:30.916
admin and dev ops work, just trying to keep stuff

00:01:30.916 --> 00:01:33.114
running. And when you have a small team and you

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:35.465
want to focus on getting new features out. And you

00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.405
want to focus on usually working on what your good

00:01:38.405 --> 00:01:41.846
at, then it is wonderful to have a platform that cushions

00:01:41.846 --> 00:01:46.030
you, for the spike and the loads. And pushes you in the right direction.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.540
&gt;&gt; That's fascinating, that's exactly hat we're

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960
trying to teach in this course. What would

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.860
be your key messages to the students of

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.860
this course, what would you tell them now?

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.010
&gt;&gt; So I think the advice I'd give to the

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.330
students is, it's important to remember there are trade-offs with any

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.410
framework or platform you use. And one of th things,

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.008
after using App Engine for a couple years, we found is.

00:02:08.008 --> 00:02:11.450
It seemed like there was a lot more work, at times,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.420
just to get started, to get something simple up and running.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.480
But, what we found with time is that it pushes you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.530
in the right direction. It pushes you to the best design

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.410
practices, for building a scalable applications. Maybe, if you're trying to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.860
build something which will serve 200 people, you could do it.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.420
Quite a bit faster if you are just running it on

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.451
a single machine. But the second you get up to 2,000, or

00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.532
20,000, or 200,000 users, it's made you make

00:02:36.532 --> 00:02:38.566
decisions, which will really put you in a

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:41.530
better place. And that is, that's it, I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.870
think the most absolutely valuable thing that it provides.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.780
&gt;&gt; That's great. Thank you so much, Mike for taking

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.340
this time. I'm sure that the student will find this valuable.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.380
&gt;&gt; Thanks, and glad I could help. And I really hope that after taking this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.850
course, students have a little bit of an

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.440
easier time than we did at the beginning.
