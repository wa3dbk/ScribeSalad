00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.980
So this is not conjunctive normal form,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.280
because we have a disjunction
over conjunction.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.490
What we want are either just
disjunctions or conjunctions for

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.660
disjunctions.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.330
So use de Morgan's law to write
this in a conjunctive normal form.
