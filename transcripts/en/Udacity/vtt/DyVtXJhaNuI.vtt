00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:04.532
So now we know that lines y equals 4 and x equals 4 are reflections of one

00:00:04.532 --> 00:00:09.975
another in the line y equals x. If we flip either of them across this line, we

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:15.280
get the other one. Now, let's say we have some function that only intersects

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.194
the line y equals 4 one time. If we find its inverse, how many times will that

00:00:21.194 --> 00:00:24.693
curve intersect the line x equals 4?
