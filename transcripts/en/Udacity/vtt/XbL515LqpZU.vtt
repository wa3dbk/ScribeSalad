00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.580
The first ideas that eventually became
the Efficient Markets Hypothesis

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.460
were postulated by
Jules Regnault in 1863.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.510
Eugene Fama carried those
ideas further in the 1960's,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.330
and it became his PhD thesis.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.350
Fama recently received a Nobel Prize,
so we know those ideas were good.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.675
So what's the efficient
market hypothesis about?

00:00:22.675 --> 00:00:25.750
We'll start by looking at some of
the assumptions that it makes.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.790
Probably the most important assumption
is it that there are a large

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.030
numbers of investors interacting
in the market for profit.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.010
So they have an incentive
to find opportunities

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.140
where the price of a stock is out of
line with what its true value is.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.320
Because there are so many of these
investors operating simultaneously, any

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.280
time a little bit of information comes
out there, the price is going to move.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.430
The next assumption is that new
information arrives randomly.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.700
So it arrives at random times,
it arrives at random rates for

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.310
different stocks, but
it's constantly arriving and

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.805
investors are paying attention
to that information and

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:14.290
therefore the prices
are adjusting quickly.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.410
Finally, the efficient
market hypothesis assumes

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.330
that the current price reflects
all available information.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.000
In other words, all this information
that's trickling in is acted upon by

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.010
the investors, the price adjusts
quickly to that information, and

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.590
the current price reflects all of
the information about that stock.
