00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.230
So what exactly is exploratory data analysis. You

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.670
can check out the Wikipedia definition in the instructor

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.750
notes but simply put it's an approach to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.710
understanding data using visualization and statistical tools. Think of

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.050
EDA as your initial interaction with data. For

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.670
example, let's say we wanted to look at a

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.080
set of cars. This data comes from the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.480
MT cars data set, which comes with RStudio.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.970
Now we couldn't make any sort of conclusions just

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.020
by reading through the table. It'd be pretty difficult.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.740
So instead what we want to do is we want to

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.070
understand the distribution of the variables for things like miles

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.580
per gallon Cylinders and perhaps horse power. We might

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.440
create histograms, which we'll see later in Lesson three.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.890
This histogram shows the distribution of weights for all

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.330
the cars. Or we might examine correlations between variables like

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.000
miles per gallon and horse power. In that case

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.740
we'd want to create a scatter plot. We'll examine these

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.100
in Lesson four. Our second goal is to assess

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.099
and validate assumptions. In which future inferences will be based.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.030
So we might ask questions like which variables are

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.590
normally distributed. Or we might be wondering if a variable

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.600
is biased toward a particular value. Now this might

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.408
not be the case for our cars data set but

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:19.683
certainly in other cases like social behavior or users

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:22.560
interacting on the web you might find that. Third

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.550
you might want to understand the data before performing

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.560
and intelligent hypothesis. Well EDA can be the source of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.140
an idea for an experiment. It's not a formal

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.160
process of hypothesis testing and

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.190
predictive modelling. Ultimately, we're developing

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.570
intuition of our data set and how it came

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.560
into existence. By examining our data we can generate better

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.560
hypothesis, determine which variables have the most predictive power.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.870
And select appropriate Statistical tools, to build our predictive models.
