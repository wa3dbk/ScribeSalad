00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.480
With Marla's help, we've covered some
of the key problems in US health care.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.200
And some of the principal arguments for
the increased use of health IT.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.010
Most health care is concerned with
the management of chronic diseases.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.070
Proper management requires a highly
coordinated, more continuous approach to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.960
care that welds together many providers
into a seamless delivery system.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.060
At the center of such a patient-centered
system of care, is the primary

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.820
care physician whose role is knowing
everything about their patients so

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.659
they can coordinate their care.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.820
In practice, this is very
difficult to achieve because of

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.320
the shortage of primary care
physicians here in the U.S.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.310
and the large number of
providers who are involved.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.150
Particularly in the care
of patients like Marla,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.950
who have multiple chronic diseases,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.260
coordinating this requires electronic
records ideally for the providers and

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.640
patients and the seamless exchange
of information among them.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.590
This same information can be used to
manage the health of populations of

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.810
patients, or the public at large.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.970
It can also be used for research
to gain new medical knowledge, and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.580
even learn how we can
improve health care delivery.
