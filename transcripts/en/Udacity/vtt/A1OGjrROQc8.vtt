00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
In this problem, we are told to define a function called countdown.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.770
Countdown takes one parameter--the number that it countdowns from--

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.810
let's call it "n." Don't forget the colon.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.180
The goal here is to countdown from "n" all the way down to blastoff.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.520
This sounds like something that is going to need a while loop.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.990
Let's get started. Let's leave the condition blank for now--

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.860
because we already know what we need to do inside the while loop,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.990
and that is, print the number.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.460
We also know at the end, that we want to blastoff.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.560
So we have two things to fill in.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.030
One, how long we countdown for?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.070
Lastly, what do we do after every count?

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.680
If we look at the sample, the last time that we count is when n=1.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.380
So, one way to do that is saying while "n" is greater than zero.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.920
Every time we countdown, we subtract 1 from "n"--so let's do that--

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.920
and all together, this will produce the outcome as expected.
