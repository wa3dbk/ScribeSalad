00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.649
Some of the issues that arise from doing this, we talked about keeping a pile,

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.988
and it's really the system as a whole that keeps the pile and we're not going to

00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:14.363
explicitly represent the system ourselves. There was the phrase that we had,

00:00:14.363 --> 00:00:20.230
has been counted, and really has been counted is more a description of

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.647
a state then an action verb. Okay, so we could say count is an action verb but

00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:30.259
has been counted as more a stative, or stative situations, so

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:36.230
we're going to revisit that when we get to looking at relationships. And

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.040
the phrases is set to, examine, and consists of. Well if you think about it

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.470
those are really an expression of what is the case.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.610
So, when you examine something, you find out what is the case there.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.880
If you examine a counter, you get back the count. These are really

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.250
ultimately going to be represented in our implementation with some kind of eq,

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.770
equality check. And so, we're going to assume that all the classes that we have

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.460
eventually come out with are going to have an equality operator associated with

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.820
them. So we're not going to explicitly model those at this time.
