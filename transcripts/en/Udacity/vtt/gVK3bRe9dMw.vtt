00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.563
If we look at either side of this equation,
we can figure out what points it corresponds to.

00:00:05.563 --> 00:00:08.207
Let's start off by remembering what this equation is saying.

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:12.582
If we look at either side of this equation, we can translate each side into a point

00:00:12.582 --> 00:00:16.523
that lies on the graph of an odd function.

00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:20.132
This is part of the beauty of using function notation.

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:26.618
f(-x) is the y value of a point.
And it also tells us what the x value of that point is.

00:00:26.618 --> 00:00:33.108
This left side means then that we have the point negative x comma, let's call it y for a y coordinate.

00:00:33.108 --> 00:00:37.749
And the right side has x as its x coordinate since that's the input.

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:44.107
And then its y coordinate, f(x), is just the negative version of this y coordinate.

00:00:44.107 --> 00:00:45.963
Now here's where it gets a little bit tricky.

00:00:45.963 --> 00:00:51.878
I didn't tell you that either of these points lies on the graph. I told you that point (x,y) lies on the graph.

00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:54.480
What's the difference between this point and this point, though?

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.822
Well, here we have negative x and then we have positive x.

00:00:57.822 --> 00:01:00.844
And here we have positive y and negative y.

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:05.277
So it looks like for each coordinate, the only thing that has changed is the sign.

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:10.620
If we do that to this point, then what we get is (-x,-y).

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.087
So that's your answer,
this is another point that lies in the curve.
