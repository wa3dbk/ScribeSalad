00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.894
So, talking about virtual resources,

00:00:01.894 --> 00:00:03.800
there's a lot of talk
about virtualization.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.910
We talked about cloud computing, and
virtualization and things like that.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.500
Once you sort of have these
virtual resources and

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.540
implement them using whatever underlying
physical resources you have, so

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.730
there's no end to what
kinds of things you can do.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.000
We said we had to go through this
translation, and someone, maybe it's,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.360
but that can be done at many levels, so

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.063
I thought we'll talk a little
bit about virtualization, and

00:00:29.063 --> 00:00:33.150
the context of the security and
protection is our main interest here.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.010
So we're not talking about
virtualization for the sake of

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.080
virtualization, but how does this
concept actually relate to isolation and

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.410
relate to protection of resources and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.210
securing them against unauthorized
access and things like that?

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.160
So, main motivation for

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.070
virtualization comes from the fact that
operating system is large and complex.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.740
And the different operating systems,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.920
different applications may require
different underlying operating systems.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.749
So one use of virtualization
commercially is actually to not be

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.207
limited to just one operating system and

00:01:06.207 --> 00:01:09.430
be able to run multiple
operating systems.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.360
But as I said before we going to look at

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.810
value of this idea when it comes
to protection and security.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.750
So, remember one other thing when
you have a single operating system

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.330
supporting all of your applications
is that if the operating system is

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.620
compromised, then it's going
to impact all applications.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.250
Every application that you have running
in that system is going to be affected

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.150
by this compromise of
the operating system because

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.690
they all have this one underlying
common operating system.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.890
Our picture was,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.880
we have all our apps, then we have our
operating system and the hardware.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.245
If something goes wrong here,
of course, all of this is affected.
