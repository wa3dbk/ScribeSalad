00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.290
So here we are in our swift extension to
UI view controller, and you'll need to

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.350
import mobile core services at the top
of the file like I've done here, and

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.870
this is where we're going to write
our launch video camera method.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.670
Let's look back at the objective
C launch camera method, and

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.010
see what we need to include here.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.492
Okay, I think I'm just going to make
a list of what this method is doing.

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:23.680
Create imagePicker,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.260
set the properties of the image picker,
what properties are we setting?

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.640
Source type, media types,
allows editing,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.090
and then set the delegate, and
then present the controller.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.970
I think that's pretty much
all this method does, cool.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.807
Now we'll copy these notes
over to the swift project, so

00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:49.174
we can fill in that method.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:55.801
Let's see what should we call
it recordVideoController,

00:00:55.801 --> 00:01:00.978
set the source type which
is of course camera.

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:06.430
Media types is a little bit tricky,
because it has to be in array, and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.258
also has to be a string, for now we're
going to set allows editing to false,

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:15.172
but we're going to change that later,

00:01:15.172 --> 00:01:19.498
we set the delegate to self,
and we're almost ready.

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.157
Present, what's going on there,

00:01:22.157 --> 00:01:26.840
cannot assign value of
type UIViewController to.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.280
We need to conform to
the protocol of course, and

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.350
also the navigationController delegate.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.290
Okay, cool, so that error went away.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.590
And then we present it.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.910
Probably don't really
need these comments now.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.280
That I do it for
presenting the camera, and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.670
now we also need to write the methods
to retrieve the video that we record.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.950
Remember there are two methods that
we need to implement that are part

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.160
of the image picker control,
or delegate protocol

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.800
did finish picking media with info,
and imagePickerController did cancel.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.190
So let's look back again at
the Objective C version, and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.220
see how these methods
are implemented there.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.240
Here we are in the Objective C project,
and

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.090
we're at the pragma mark for
ImagePickerControllerDelegate Methods.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.140
If we look here in the method
didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo,

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.930
we can see that first,
we need to check the media type.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.730
Then, if the media type is a movie,
we need to save this raw video URL.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.215
And then here, the comments say get
start, and end points for a trim video.

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:41.025
Well we're not trimming the video yet,
so we can skip that part, and then here,

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:46.640
it's gotta call to crop video to square,
we're not cropping the video yet either.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.470
I'll tell you what, for now, we'll just
save this video to the photos album

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.900
that way we'll know the recording
functionality is working.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.730
So we're back in the Swift version of
our UI view controller extension, and

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.600
to make this file a little more
readable, I went ahead, and moved

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.410
to the image picker controller delegate
methods into an additional extension.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.460
Here in the method did finish
picking media with info

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.550
is where we want to save our
video to the photo album.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.790
So we'll call the method
UISaveVideoAtPath to save

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.360
to photos album, and we'll remember to
dismiss this view controller the image

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.290
picker controller,
this has to be a path.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.780
And, if we scroll up to our launch video
camera method you can see that it's been

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.600
connected to storyboard,
it's connected to the record button.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.510
So our launch video camera method is
ready, our image picker controller

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.779
delegate methods are ready, so
let's run it, and see how it looks.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.950
Okay, now keep in mind that when I show
you these representations of the phone

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.020
on the screen.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.870
I'm actually showing you a movie that
I recorded of me running the app on my

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.630
phone, because of course you're going to
need to be running the app on device,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.340
if you're testing anything
involving the camera,

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.020
you won't be able to use the simulator.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.930
Here you can see I can launch the
camera, I took a video of my teammate,

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.020
the cameras dismissed, and here you can
see that when I go out of the app, and

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.092
then I go into my photo library
my video is there, fantastic.
