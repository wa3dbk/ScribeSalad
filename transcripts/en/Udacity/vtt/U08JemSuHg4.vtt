00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So the task for you now is to implement the function with three input arguments

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that it computes this number over here so that it can vary any of those

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and still get the absolute correct answer for this function over here.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If you've never programmed before, this is tricky.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You have to add one more argument and you have to change the returned function to implement

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
a formula just like this but this using p0, p1, p2

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
as arguments not just the fixed numerical numbers here.
