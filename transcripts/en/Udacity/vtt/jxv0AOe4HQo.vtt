00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.797
Now back to our discussion of the Spring

00:00:02.797 --> 00:00:05.792
system at Sun. There is always a quadrum

00:00:05.792 --> 00:00:09.209
of how to innovate in the operating system.

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.317
Academia is ripe for pursuing ideas that are

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:14.921
on the lunatic French but, if you are

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:18.617
an industry, you are always worried about, should

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:22.440
we do a brand new operating system? Or

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.720
do a better implementation of a known operating system.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.350
Research industry is usually constrained by the

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.310
market place that it serves, specifically if you're

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.520
a company like Sun Microsystems; which in

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.390
its heydays, between 1980 and the 2005, it

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.690
was making Unix workstations. And it was

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.700
building large complex server systems which run 24/7

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.930
for a variety of applications, such as

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.390
airline reservation and so on and so forth.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.900
And if you are in that marketplace, the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.330
question becomes should we build a brand new

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.150
operating system or build a better implementation of

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.069
a known operating system? Marketplace demand says that, well,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.740
there are legacy applications that are running on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.630
your current operating system and therefore building a brand

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.200
new operating system may not be that viable

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.040
in an industrial setting. So the approach they took

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.070
in the Spring system at Sun Microsystems, is to be different but innovate where

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.130
it makes sense. And, it is a sort of like the, you may have seen commercials

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.810
that says, Intel inside, and the idea

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.120
is in processor architecture, Intel is dominant and

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.270
a lot of interesting computer architecture research

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.081
happens in innovating under the covers in the

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:45.070
micro architecture. So the external interface is

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.620
still well known interface like the Intel processor

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.630
but underneath they do a lot of innovation

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.250
in the micro architecture. In a similar manner,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.570
if you are a company like Sun Microsystems

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.170
that peddles Unix boxes and you want to retain

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.072
your customer base, then you want to make sure

00:02:03.072 --> 00:02:07.412
that the external interface remains UNIX and external

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:10.639
interface remains as UNIX. But under the covers,

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.270
you innovate where it makes sense. And in particular,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.930
you want to make sure that everything that you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.220
do in the operating system allows third party vendors,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.090
to develop software against the new APIs that you

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.310
may provide in the operating system and integrate that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.510
into operating system. While at the same time, making

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.660
sure that such integration is not going to break anything.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.490
Or said differently, you want to preserve all the things

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.080
that are good in standard operating system, but at the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.820
same time you want to make sure that the innovation

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.490
allows extensibility, flexibility and so on. That's sort of the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.610
approach that Spring system took and for all the things

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.470
that I just said, using object orientation is a good

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.780
choice in order to make sure that we can do

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.040
innovation under the covers, while keeping the external interface the same.
