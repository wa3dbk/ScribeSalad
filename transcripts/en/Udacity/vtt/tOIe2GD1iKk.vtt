00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.609
Let us return to the exercise that we were trying to do earlier,

00:00:03.609 --> 00:00:07.535
where we had eagle and bluebird and penguin. And we had features, and

00:00:07.535 --> 00:00:11.441
we had values for the eagle and the bluebird and the penguin. Well,

00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:17.280
given these three sets of values for the eagle, bluebird and penguin. And given

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.960
that bird is a superclass of these three classes. What would be the features

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.280
that you would put in the bird node in that classification hierarchy?
