00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.550
So what if you could not
use typeset languages?

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.500
You could not use languages like Java or

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.670
others that do this checking to prevent
all memory overflow kind of attacks.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.210
What can we do in that case if you're
stuck with let's say languages for

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.520
whatever reason, we talked about a few,
where this is not done automatically,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.400
what should we be doing?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.550
So when we are using these so

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.530
called unsafe languages that
automatically don't prevent buffer

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.560
overflows then it become
the responsibility of the programmer.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.554
If you're writing code it
is your responsibility

00:00:38.615 --> 00:00:42.235
that you deal with this problem
of potential buffer overflows.

00:00:42.235 --> 00:00:45.795
One way you can do that is
by checking ALL input, okay?

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:50.295
So secure coding mantra
is that trust no input.

00:00:50.295 --> 00:00:54.205
All input is evil and
you should be checking

00:00:54.205 --> 00:00:58.120
that it can conforms to
whatever your expectation was.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.790
Don't rely on the underlying system to
do those because we're talking about

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.410
using languages that do
not do automatically.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.400
So secure coding is an extremely
as you write programs.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.460
You write them to implement
certain functionality.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.920
You may even write them with some
performance goals in mind, but

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.560
at the same time you need to keep in
mind that you have to write them so

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.470
they cannot be exploited.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.400
You have to code securely or
use secure coding practices so your

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.760
program doesn't have the vulnerabilities
like the ones we've been talking about.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.960
And one way you do that
is by checking ALL input.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.730
The other thing that you can do is,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.090
you can use functions that
are safer that do bound checking.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.840
So remember in the code we could
have string compare or string copy.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.295
You could also have certain side string,

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:50.350
though you shouldn't be dealing with
a string that is longer than that.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.489
So their functions that would place
a limit on the length of the string this

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.170
function would manipulate.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.217
So you can use there number of
safer ways to use certain functions

00:02:01.217 --> 00:02:05.889
that are unsafe and the patterns and
ways of using those that

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:11.050
are safer where the likelihood of
a vulnerability is a lot lower.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.324
So these functions, all though the
language doesn't do it, the functions

00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:19.464
that you do will do the checking or
the bounds checking that we're talking

00:02:19.464 --> 00:02:24.330
about, and as a result using those leads
to code that is safer more secure.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.400
And the last thing you can do after
written some code that's not in

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.970
a typeset language, is to use tools
that exist that would actually

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.248
analyze code that you have written and
flag potential vulnerability.

00:02:39.248 --> 00:02:44.190
The way they able to do that is,
they can look for certain code patterns.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.740
They can look for
certain unsafe functions, and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.390
can warn you that the code fragment
that you have where these things appear,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.920
an unsafe function appears,
could be potentially

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.430
vulnerable to some sort of exploit
buffer overflow or something like that.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.730
So these tools, you just run your
code through these tools and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.520
there's a lot of them
that are out there.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.990
Some commercial,
some you can get for free.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.080
And these tools they
rely on sort of database

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.340
of certain kind of patterns
that are known to be unsafe.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.940
And if they run into your code that
matches those kind of patterns,

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.320
they can flag those.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.940
And they can do more sophisticated
analysis to potentially discover

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.000
the kind of vulnerability
that we're talking about.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.590
So there's no excuse for
writing code that is not secure.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.410
You should be checking your input.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.330
You should be using safer functions
that do that checking automatically.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.030
And then you should run through
your coded through these tools

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.840
that can flag potential problem spots.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.840
And you should go back and
look at that and

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.450
see how you can actually make those
potential vulnerabilities go away.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.890
One problem with automatic tools
is that they may have a lot of

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.290
false positives or if they miss out and
they have false negatives.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.650
So you can't have tools that will have
zero false positives or false negatives,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.180
but the tools can certainly help
us get rid of many possible

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.720
vulnerabilities in the process producing
code that is a lot more secure.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.155
So even when you are stuck with
programming in a language that's not

00:04:12.155 --> 00:04:15.780
going to help you much with the kind of
attacks, vulnerabilities that we've been

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.790
talking about, there's certainly things
you can do as a programmer who likes to

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.230
do secure programming by checking input,
using safer functions, and

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.570
then running, checking your code through
these tools that we're talking about.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.770
And we'll have a long list of these
tools actually you can go and

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:32.340
learn about.
