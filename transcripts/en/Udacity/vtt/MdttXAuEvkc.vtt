00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.201
Here are the correct expressions. If you got these, excellent work. I know these

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:08.220
last two were pretty tricky. So, it's okay if you didn't get them right on your

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.208
first try. First, we can distribute the 5th power to the 7 squared and the x

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:16.398
squared. Now, we apply our power to our power rule. We multiply 2 times 5 to get

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:20.962
7 to the 10th. And 2 times 5 to get x to the 10th. We could only distribute this

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:25.787
power of 5, because they had factors here. Numbers and variables multiplied

00:00:25.787 --> 00:00:29.862
together. Then next one, we distribute the square to 3 to the 1, n cubed and n

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:34.460
squared. And we get this. We multiply the exponents together to get 3 squared. N

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.840
to the 6th, and n to the 4th. Finally, for the last one, we carry out the same

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.460
steps. We have a cubed, cubed. B squared cubed and c to the 1 cubed. Raising a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.296
power to a power. We get a to the 9th, b to the 6th and c cubed. There's our

00:00:50.296 --> 00:00:51.345
final answer.
