00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.688
How about miles on a car and the value of that car? We would think that the

00:00:05.688 --> 00:00:11.418
more miles a car has traveled, the less the value. No matter what the variables

00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:18.090
we're measuring, we usually call one of them x, for simplicity and the other y.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.624
Usually we want to know how the y variable changes when we change the x

00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:26.758
variable. So x is often called the predictor variable or the explanatory

00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:33.396
variable or the independent variable. What do you think y is called then? When

00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:37.730
you answer this try and think of the opposite of what the x variable is called.
