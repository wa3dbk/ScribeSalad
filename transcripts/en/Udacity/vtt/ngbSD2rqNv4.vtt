00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.940
So let's do a quiz on block sizes now.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:09.680
Consider a cache that is 32 kilobytes
in size and has a 64 byte block size.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.085
So let's consider a program
that accesses variables X1, X2,

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:19.030
etc., up to some XN, and
these are scalar variables,

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.120
not part of an array, and let's assume
that the program has lots of temporal

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.360
locality when accessing these
variables but no spatial locality.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.479
The question for you is what is
the largest N, the number of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:37.060
these variables, that still results
in a high hit rate in this cache?

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.860
Put the number here.
