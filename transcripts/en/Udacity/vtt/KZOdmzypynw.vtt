00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.280
When we looked at list data structures,
traversal was pretty straightforward.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.210
We just needed to go
through the list in order

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.710
to make sure we looked at every element.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.135
Trees aren't linear, so there's no clear
way to traverse through everything.

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:18.655
Suppose we start at the root,
do we go left first or right first?

00:00:18.655 --> 00:00:21.905
Should we completely
traverse one subtree or

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:26.522
one section of the tree including
a parent and all of its descendants or

00:00:26.522 --> 00:00:29.671
traverse everything at
the same level first?

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:34.512
Traversal in a tree is a bit more
complicated but it's equally important.

00:00:34.512 --> 00:00:38.102
We can't search or sort elements unless
we have a way to make sure we can

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:40.220
visit all elements first.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.242
There are two different broad
approaches to treat traversal.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:47.532
One is called depth-first search or
DFS for short.

00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:52.639
In DFS, the philosophy is if there
are children nodes to explore,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.150
exploring them is
definitely the priority.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.410
We'll take a more in-depth look
at what that means in a minute.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.540
The alternative is called
breadth-first search or BFS.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.120
In BFS, the priority is visiting every
node on the same level we're currently

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.100
on before visiting child nodes.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.430
BFS and DFS are kind of vaguely defined
since we can apply their principles but

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.640
actually traverse the tree
in several different ways.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.540
For trees,

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.290
a level order traversal is a BFS with
a more exact algorithm to implement.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.280
A level order traversal is
exactly what it sounds like.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.910
Start at the root then visit its
children on the second level then all of

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.630
their children on the third level until
you've visited every single leaf.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.550
By convention, we start on the left
most side of the level and move right.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.390
This traversal is definitely a BFS.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.880
We're visiting all nodes at the same
level before moving on to child nodes.
