00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.859
There are a couple of other odds and ends

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:05.180
about the if statement that I want to briefly talk

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.440
about. So you know now that the if statement

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.990
makes a decision. You go one way or another, depending

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.907
on some condition. Now, sometimes, you're code is arranged

00:00:15.907 --> 00:00:18.747
so that you don't actually have a decision to do

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:21.729
one thing or another, but the decision is between

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:25.337
one thing and nothing at all. For example, over here,

00:00:25.337 --> 00:00:29.159
I've rearranged the code for computing the actual floor a

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.740
bit. I'm initializing actual flow with the floor and then

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.630
I only need to adjust it if the floor is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.480
greater than 13 and otherwise I need do nothing at

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200
all. In this case, it is perfectly legal to omit

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.270
the else part. That's like if you only choose between

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.570
doing something or just staying in place. It's okay to

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.740
do more than one thing. You could put other actions

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.810
inside here, maybe a print statement. Generally in more

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.440
complicated situations, there's going to be several statements in between the

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.660
braces. Conversely, if there is only one action here, it's

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.390
legal to omit the braces. But we won't ever do

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.340
that, it's just clear to always put them there.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.750
Makes the code easier to read. Now go ahead and

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.020
work out a couple more practice problems with Sarah. And

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.940
then we'll talk more about how these conditions are formed.
