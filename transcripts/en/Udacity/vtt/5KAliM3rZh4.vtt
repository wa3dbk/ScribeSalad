00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.630
So far, we've figured out how to do one transformation to f of x equals x

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.909
cubed. We've shifted it to the right by one unit. However, we know that this

00:00:08.909 --> 00:00:13.634
wasn't the function we were actually looking to end up with. We wanted f of x

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:19.292
equals negative x -1 cubed. So, what does this negative sign out front do? This

00:00:19.292 --> 00:00:24.143
negative sign is going to cause our function to be reflected in some way. But

00:00:24.143 --> 00:00:29.889
which axis will it be reflected in? Please write either x or y in this box.
