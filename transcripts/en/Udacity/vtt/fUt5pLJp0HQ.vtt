00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.050
Earlier we saw that screen readers
will announce an element's role, name,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.470
state and
value not necessarily in that order.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.770
By using the bright semantic element,
we've got role, state and value covered,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.760
but we also need to make sure that we're
making elements name discoverable.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.140
This is actually the very first
item on web aims checklist,

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.730
provide text alternatives for
any non text content.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.920
At this point, I'm going to take
a quick tangent on technology.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.200
We're in the unfortunate position
of having all of these terms.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.100
Each of which is overloaded in
its own particular way in HTML,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.510
which are also used in various contexts
to refer to the same central concept

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.020
we're talking about in this lesson.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.270
Since the way the term label is used in
HTML is closest to what we mean here for

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.290
the rest of this course,
I'm going to refer to label

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.070
interchangeably to
refer to this concept.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.740
But please keep in mind that in
the context of role, name, value, and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.960
state, the name means the same thing.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.060
With that out of the way,
let's talk a bit about labels.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.730
Broadly, there are two types of labels.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.480
Visible labels,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.790
which are used by all users to
associate meaning with an element, and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.420
text alternatives which are only used
when there's no need for visual labels.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.778
Or here we've got an image that is
self-explanatory to anyone who can see

00:01:16.778 --> 00:01:17.489
the image.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:21.911
By its very nature a text alternative
is usually not visible on the page.

00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:26.386
So in this case, we can see this
image of bees swarming, an assistive

00:01:26.386 --> 00:01:30.960
technology user would simply have
access to this bee swarming label.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.800
The checklist provides a list
of recommendations for

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.410
how to create visible and
non-visible labels.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.350
The easiest is this one.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.780
Form buttons have a descriptive value.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.550
A button typically has
some text content,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.850
and that acts as the button's
text alternative.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.530
Since this text is visible to both sided
users and technology, we're lucky,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.390
because we don't need to do any more
work to create a good experience

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.230
versus to technology uses.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.110
So that's an easy one to check off.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.430
Next we need to check that form
inputs have associated text labels.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.390
When we create a form input like a check
box and just put some text next to it,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.240
we get a visual label, but
we didn't actually create

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.210
a programmatically accessible label for
the element we're trying to label.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.140
Also, we don't get the nice behavior
where we can click on the label to total

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.460
the check box.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.120
We can fix this by
using a label element.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.830
We can either wrap the input element
like this, or we can use the for

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.770
attribute on the label.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.860
If we do that we need to make sure
to give the input element an ID and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.305
use the same ID as the value of the for
attribute.

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:37.275
That creates an association
between the label element and

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:40.255
the input element,
whichever these two methods to use,

00:02:40.255 --> 00:02:43.625
we will get an accessible label for
the check box, and

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.755
we'll be able to total the check
box by clicking the label.
