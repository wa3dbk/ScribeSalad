00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.519
So we invented a third type of cache,

00:00:02.519 --> 00:00:06.994
which is called virtually indexed and
physically tagged cache,

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:11.650
which is trying to combine the
advantages of the two types of cache.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.897
It works like this.

00:00:12.897 --> 00:00:17.830
We start with the virtual address,
we break it down into the cache offset,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.440
index and tag, but we don't use the tag.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.540
We do use the index bits
from the virtual address

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.040
to find the set that
we want in the cache.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.927
We read the valid bits and
the tags here.

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:36.547
But meanwhile, we use the page
number from the virtual address to

00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:39.404
access the TLB and get the frame number.

00:00:39.404 --> 00:00:42.249
So now that we got the physical address,

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:47.368
we perform the tag check using the
physical address not the virtual one.

00:00:47.368 --> 00:00:50.741
This is why this is
called a virtual index.

00:00:50.741 --> 00:00:53.362
The index bits come from
the virtual address.

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:57.101
The tag bits come from
the physical address, cache.

00:00:57.101 --> 00:01:01.550
And from here, it proceeds normally,
we know whether we have a hit and so on.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.510
So how does this help?

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.349
Note that the cache array and the TLB
access are proceeding in parallel.

00:01:09.349 --> 00:01:13.763
So if the TLB is fast enough and
usually it is because it's small,

00:01:13.763 --> 00:01:16.988
the hit time will be equal
to the cache hit time.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:21.153
It's actually the maximum of the two,
which is usually the cache hit time.

00:01:21.153 --> 00:01:25.482
So this is just like the virtual or
virtual index virtually tagged cache and

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:26.314
we like that.

00:01:26.314 --> 00:01:30.918
We get the speed advantage of
the virtual caches with this type of

00:01:30.918 --> 00:01:31.778
cache too.

00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:34.521
Do we need to flush on a context switch?

00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:35.909
Well, it turns out no.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.575
Because if we switch the process, so

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:43.738
that virtual addresses correspond
to different physical addresses.

00:01:43.738 --> 00:01:47.658
What we find in the cache will be
checked against the actual physical

00:01:47.658 --> 00:01:48.290
address.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.430
So the virtual address in another
process will map maybe to the same set.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.717
But once it maps there,
the actual tag is not going to match,

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:00.704
because these two have different tags.

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:06.554
So this is like the physical cache and
is nice, but what about aliasing?

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:11.481
Recall that aliasing happens,
because multiple virtual addresses in

00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.839
the same address space might map
to the same physical address.

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.706
But because we do virtual
access to the cache,

00:02:18.706 --> 00:02:22.611
these addresses might end up in
different places in the cache.

00:02:22.611 --> 00:02:25.848
Thus, right to one will
not be seen by the other.

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:30.427
It turns out that there are no aliasing
problems in the virtually index physical

00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:33.500
tagged cache,
as long as the cache is small enough and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.597
it has to do with where
are the index bits coming from.

00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:42.700
So this is very, very nice, because it
basically gives us the correctness.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.555
The no flush on context switch of
the physical caches with the hit time

00:02:46.555 --> 00:02:47.885
of the virtual caches,

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:51.890
but let's figure out what do we need
to do in order to not have aliasing.
