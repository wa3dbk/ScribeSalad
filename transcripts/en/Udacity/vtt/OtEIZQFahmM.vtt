00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.153
When we first defined our tables,

00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:05.275
we defined the relationship between them
in terms of constraints.

00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:08.029
Now we are going to implement
that relationship

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.910
into our query using a join.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.280
This join will allow us
to query the weather table

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.560
for values from
a specific location setting.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.290
We'll start by adding
a SQL ITE query builder class variable

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.060
at the top of WeatherProvider.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.830
We'll initialize the SQL ITE query builder

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.210
in the static constructor for the class,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.500
describing the join between both tables.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.030
Note, since both tables
have a column named _ID,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.860
we must explicitly use the TABLE_NAME

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.600
in order to disambiguate which _ID
we are talking about in the join.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.390
Then we can define the query.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.200
The query is to find using 
the question mark replacement syntax.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.440
These question marks will be replaced
by the query parameters.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.010
Since we allow people to specify
the start date in the URI,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.460
we're also going to add
a second selection

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.850
which includes checking to see
whether DATETEXT

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.370
is greater than or equal to our parameter.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.320
Next, we'll add a method
to get the weather by location entry,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.090
using the same query builder.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.970
Note, that we fetch
the parameters from our URI.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.490
And build a string array,
so they can be substituted into our query.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.470
Note that if a URI
does not contain a start date,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.913
we actually use a different selection.

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:23.850
Finally, we add the function

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.440
into the query routine
of our content provider.
