00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.410
All right.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.930
So here we are back at our eye again and

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.920
let's start talking about sort
of the most important part.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.690
This is the part of your eye,
the retina.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.190
It's the part of your
brain that is in your eye.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.590
Now here is a picture
schematic of a retina, okay?

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.310
And first you'll notice there are these
receptors called rods and cones, and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.500
we'll talk about those in a minute.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.340
And then those receptors
connect to these things called

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.160
horizontal bipolar cells, which take
the chemical output of the receptors and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.080
eventually turn them into stimulation
for these ganglion cells,

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.210
which are the first proper nerves, these
are the nerves that actually produce

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.980
firing spikes that we're used to for
nerve cells.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.720
But when you look at this,
you should look at that curvature, and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.070
it should bother you a little bit,
right?

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.960
So here's the picture of my eye, okay.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.370
But you see of course my thing is,
is bent this way.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.520
And this thing is sort of bent that way.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.360
So actually what I need to do is, and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.610
I'm really proud of this,
is we need to rotate that picture.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.190
So this curvature here is
like this curvature there.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.328
At which point you realize what
comes up this way, the light.

00:01:16.328 --> 00:01:18.300
All right?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.250
The human system has what's referred
to as an inverted retina, okay?

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.560
And that is the light comes in,
and passes through, all this gunk.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.830
It passes through,
there are blood vessels in here,

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.430
there's nerves,
it passes right through them.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.880
Then it hits your photo receptors, okay,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.450
and then any stray light keeps going,
sort of gets absorbed.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.450
This background layer,
this is called the pigment epithelium.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.360
This is actually a very black
pigment in the back of your eye.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.380
So, you might ask,
why would you build an inverted retina?

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.240
&gt;&gt; Why would you build
an inverted retina?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.050
&gt;&gt; Nobody asked me, but
here's some, some speculation.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.460
There are a couple of things.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.690
The, the reason that,
that I like best is.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.370
What happens is, is that the light goes
through here and anyone that happens to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.900
hit the photoreceptors,
right there, gets absorbed.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.590
And then after that,
it hits this pigment epithelium.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.985
Okay, and what that means is
the pigment epithelium absorbs

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:24.215
any stray light, so it eliminates
scatter within the, within the eye.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:28.845
And that gives you
a very sharp resolution.

00:02:28.845 --> 00:02:31.415
It reduces your ability to
see at night a little bit.

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:34.110
We'll talk about the sensitivity
of rods and cones in a little bit.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.840
But it gives you this, this idea
that you know, first the, the light,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.920
whatever light gets absorbed by
the detectors goes into processing and

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.900
everything else is absorbed and removed.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.770
It doesn't cause any disturbance.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.250
It does mean that there's a funny
sort of thing that goes on.

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.300
These structures produce a very, they're
clear because they're made out of you

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.500
know, gelatinous stuff
that is biological tissue.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.690
But of course it causes little shadows,
right.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.330
So if you go right
past the blood vessel,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.360
it'd be actually a little
bit of a shadow.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.840
So you might ask,
why don't we see these shadows.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.610
&gt;&gt; Why don't we see these shadows?

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.840
&gt;&gt; The human eyeball is remarkable.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.180
Anything that's perfectly stabilized
on your eye, the brain just removes.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.710
Okay?
So

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.450
that shadow stays exactly in
the same place on the retina.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.650
The brain just removes it.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.010
In fact, there are some cool tricks
you can do by building little sta,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.260
stabilization systems that will keep
something projected exactly the same

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.530
place on the eye and
eventually you just don't see it.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.540
So, anyway, so
that's the inverted retina of the eye
