00:00:00.018 --> 00:00:02.083
Now is time to get started programming in Python.

00:00:02.083 --> 00:00:04.282
For this class, you don't need to install any software.

00:00:04.282 --> 00:00:07.448
You can run your Python programs directly
using the web browser.

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:11.319
After the video finishes, you'll see a window that looks like this that you can use

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.643
to write and execute Python code.

00:00:13.643 --> 00:00:18.896
In the top part, which we call the editor, you can enter Python code. For example,

00:00:18.896 --> 00:00:25.011
we'll enter the code print 3. Print is the Python command that prints something out

00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:29.129
after the print we have and expression and the value of that expression is what gets printed.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.538
This could be a simple thing like the number 3.

00:00:31.538 --> 00:00:34.887
It can also be a more complicated expression, 
doing some arithmetic.

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:36.854
We write our code up here, when we click run...

00:00:38.146 --> 00:00:40.811
... it will run the code, we'll see the output.

00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:44.102
And here, the first line ran and printed 3.

00:00:44.102 --> 00:00:47.807
The second line printed the result of 
this computation which is 101,

00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:50.221
if you don't believe me you can try it yourself.

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.711
We'll talk lots more about Python expressions soon but I think you actually know enough now

00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:57.711
to already be able to write your first program.
So it's time for the first programming quizz.
