You may have already thought of this, but another thing we could do is two

00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:08.800
memory tests on each person, one where they don't get much sleep, and one where

00:00:08.812 --> 00:00:13.296
they get a lot of sleep. Then we can compare the results between each person's

00:00:13.308 --> 00:00:18.220
test. If we did this, what would we be controlling for? Would we be controlling

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:23.495
for differences in memory capabilities due to gender, or differing amounts of

00:00:23.507 --> 00:00:28.570
sleep amongst individuals? Or the variation in people's individual memory

00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:33.095
capabilities? Or time of day at which subjects took the memory test?
