00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.630
Your goals need to be really specific,
with numbers and deadlines.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.254
For example, increasing app
downloads by 5% in 30 days.

00:00:08.254 --> 00:00:11.634
You can use these goals as your KPIs or
key performance indicators for

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:13.160
the next few months.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.059
This will help you evaluate
the success of your business.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.530
Remember, a KPI is a business metric

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.230
that you'll use to evaluate factors
that are important to your success.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.560
Each business will have different KPIs.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.918
For example, a clothing store's
KPI may be net revenue.

00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:31.940
The government's KPI
may be employment rate.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.650
Or as for Embarkment, our KPI could be
the number of sitters we have on our

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.230
site, or the traffic we get to the site.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.420
So to choose these goals, you'll want
to start thinking about the stage in

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.500
the funnel you want to improve on.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.398
Is your goal to try and
bring in more visitors?

00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:48.997
Here you're going to
want to consider traffic.

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:54.020
So your goal could be to increase
traffic by 5% in the next 60 days.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.430
Maybe your goal is to
convert customers to leads.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.370
You can consider sign ups here.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180
So your aim could be to obtain 15,000

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.140
sign ups to receive launch
notifications over the next 90 days.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.480
Or maybe your goal is to
convert leads to customers.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.690
We could consider enrollment here.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.140
Our goal could be to enroll 5% of our
leads into our premium subscription,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.710
or just to turn them
into paying customers.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:20.770
Goals like these are trackable,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.270
and we can easily tie them into our
Google Analytics account to track.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.510
We'll discuss that later in the course.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.280
Okay, so taking in what you've learned
so far about setting your marketing

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.420
goals, I want you to revisit the two
goals you created earlier and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.710
change them to reflect
what you've learned.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.450
Now challenge yourself with this,
but be realistic.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.440
You don't have all the money
in the world, yet,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.400
and your team is probably understaffed.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.430
