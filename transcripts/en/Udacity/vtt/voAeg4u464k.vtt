We do the same thing we've been doing. If we travel 0 miles, we plug 0 in for

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.410
x. And the we get 160.13, which is our y intercept. It's kind of hard to see

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:19.260
with this graph. Basically, this means you're paying an additional $160.13 for

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.660
every flight. No matter how far you're going, and then an additional 20 cents

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.150
for every mile traveled.
