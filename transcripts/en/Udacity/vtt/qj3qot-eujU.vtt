00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.392
Now we're ready to start creating canvas tiles to cache some of our draw calls.

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:08.667
We'll put this functionality in our preDrawCache function. We need to walk

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:12.948
through our map tiles and for each tile create a new canvas tile container of

00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.021
the correct width Height and x, y position in the world. After this we need to

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.831
push each canvas style into a new array that we've made to keep track of them

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:24.861
inside our TILEDmap class. So finally we don't want to set the fully loaded flag

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:28.811
until true until after canvas styles have been created and filled in. So we've

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:32.772
modified our image loading code. Call back. To rather than actually setting the

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:36.455
flag, it calls preDrawCache and said. Once all of our canvasses have been filled

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:39.893
in, we can then safely set fullyloaded equal to true, so that rendering can

00:00:39.893 --> 00:00:40.918
continue in the future.
