00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
Notice that in all these cases, we perform the same steps of the same operation

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.463
with the exponents that have the same base. So what general rule could you write

00:00:09.463 --> 00:00:14.003
for any base that's non-zero, and its exponents a and b? What would x to the a

00:00:14.003 --> 00:00:18.583
times x to the b always equal? As a hint, think back to what you did in the last

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.784
problems. What were you doing with these exponents?
