Okay. Now that you've been through the material from Lesson

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.030
One, let's see if you can complete the concept map

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.420
that we showed earlier. Remember a concept map is just

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.950
connecting words to each other using other concepts or words that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.820
are relevant to both. For example, a genome is a

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.640
genetic instructions for traits, and both are influenced by something that

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.850
belongs in this blank here. What I want you to

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.790
do is fill in each blank you see in the concept

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.870
map using words that you find in the word bank

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.500
over here. If you think you know the correct word for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.820
that blank, just take it from the word bank and

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.350
type it into the box you see in the concept map.
