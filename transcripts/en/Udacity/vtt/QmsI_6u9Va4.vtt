00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So that probability is greater than 0.999,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the reason for that is the only way she wouldn't be caught

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is if the two people she spends the bill with

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
take exactly the same challenge.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The challenge is 10 bits long,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so the probability that would happen

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
is 1/2^10--1 in 1,024.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And 1 minus that is greater than 0.999.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So that's pretty high.  If that's not good enough, we could increase m.
