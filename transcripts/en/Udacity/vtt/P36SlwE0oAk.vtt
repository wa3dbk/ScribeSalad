00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's look at another data set reaching x and y, and now I'm going to ask you a different question,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is the parameter b, is it negative or positive?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Assuming that this is 0, 0, and say this is 10, 10.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I ask you the same for the parameter a. Is this negative of positive?

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
In either case choose exactly one answer.
