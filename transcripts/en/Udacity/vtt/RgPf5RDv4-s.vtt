00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.660
Okay, I'd like to go over each of the approaches we've

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.140
talked about, and kind of the, the different properties they have. So

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.430
the first approach was no caching and, and this meant on

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.580
every page view, we we're doing a DB read, and when we

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.730
submitted a new piece of art, there was no DB reads.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.700
Then we did this kind of what I would describe as the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.670
naive caching approach. Which was basically have the basic cache if

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.260
the cache is empty, do the DB read, and if it's not,

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.490
return the result. And what we'll, we'll add a, a third

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.490
column on the edge here called Bugs. So the naive caching

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.190
only does a DB read on a cache miss and doesn't

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.450
do any reading on a submit, and is full of bugs. [LAUGH]

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.470
Or at least has one bug, where the, the front page

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.500
would become out of, out of date, the front page would

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.440
become stale, so then, we started clearing the cache. This has

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.270
the same property of doing a DB read on a page view,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.030
no DB read on a submit and no bugs. Then,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.180
we improve to the kind of the refreshing of the

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.660
cache. And so this means we're no longer doing and

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.000
DB reads on page views, or very rarely, basically only

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.950
the first time our app turns on and the cache

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.540
is empty and that first page view. Every other page

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.730
view after that is cached, which is a really nice

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.280
property to have. And we're doing one DB read per submission,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.230
and it works. Now, the difference between, between

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.850
these two and this one, is the notion

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.300
that a page view doesn't hit the database

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.420
hardly ever and that's a really nice property

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.260
to have. You should always be striving to

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.900
have the situation where a normal, un-logged in,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.660
basic, you know, viewer of your website, doesn't

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.580
touch the database. And I'm going to kind of condense

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.770
that down to the notion that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.230
simple users shouldn't touch the database. Basically,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.250
you know, they're just lurkers, they're

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.720
just reading. They're, they're not changing the

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.930
site so they shouldn't be touching the database. Everything should be cached and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.310
ready to go for them. That makes the user experience better because the

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.810
request will be faster and it makes, keeps your load down because you

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.880
can add many, many of those users. And because they're just bouncing off

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.160
the cache you don't have to do very much work to serve them.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.670
You don't actually have to hit the database now, there's a fourth approach

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.410
that we didn't implement yet. Which is the most aggressive of

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.960
all of these, and I'm going to kind of refer to this as

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.010
distinct from refreshing the cache, I'm going to call it updating the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.610
cache. And I'll, and I'll talk about this approach in just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.950
a sec and we can get to the state where on

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.060
a, on a page view, on a simple page view, we

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.450
do zero DB reads ever and this is slightly better than

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.550
rarely. And we don't do any database reads on submission either, and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.440
it works. This is a really nice property to have now of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.410
course, we still do our database right. You notice we haven't been

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.050
optimizing rights at all, because you've got to store this, you've gotta

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.480
store the submission at some point. But you can cut down on the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.440
data base reads lower them to both zero by keeping your cache

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.100
completely up to date, and I'll show you how we might do that

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.775
right now. Okay, we're going to look at this picture one more time

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:56.560
here. We know all the pieces now, the user, the ASCIIchan the database,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.980
and our cache. We're going to talk about a new situation

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.470
here. So let's talk about, let's pretend our cache is already warm.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.900
You know it's got some pictures in there, and reading the front

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.980
page which hits our cache which you know, returns the result that

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.360
we send back to the user. Nothing too complex there, we're not

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.910
hitting the database because we're only doing reads. Now what happens is

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.380
when we use a database write, we're going to send that right to

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.200
the database, or simultaneously going to send that right to our cache

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.340
as well. And so this, this gets a little bit

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.830
more complex, we're going to send to write to the database,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.930
and instead of immediately rereading from the database to update

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.610
our cache or clearing our cache, we're just going to update the

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.860
cache. We're going to say okay, this affects the front page,

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.670
so let's find that front page cache, insert our new

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.070
piece of you know, ASCII art into the cache, and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.300
then from then on, that follow up request that, that redirects,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.810
that follow-up request to slash is basically going to bounce right

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.700
off the cache again. So, we never did, we never did a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.740
database read during this whole process, we're just writing only. The only

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.590
time we would do a database read is when we that start

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.960
up the app for the first time and do the first request,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.320
or maybe we have a program that does that for us. So

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.250
no user ever does a database read. This is exactly how we

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.510
do it on Reddit now. Every listing you can look at is

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.440
stored in it's own cache. And when you submit a

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.140
link or do a vote we update all of the appropriate

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.374
caches, all the different cache keys that may be affected. So,

00:04:21.374 --> 00:04:25.137
so it kind of introduced the trade-off here of complex inserts

00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:29.210
versus database reads. On reddit we actually do this, we have

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.850
a different cache key for every listing you might look at,

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.260
for every sorting, for every subreddit, etcetera, etcetera. And when you

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.630
submit a link or you vote, we have to update all

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.550
of, all of the possible listings that could be affected

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.300
by that action. On the flipside, you know, users are pummeling

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.580
the site all the time and they never read from

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.240
the Database. And you know, so we have complex inserts plus

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.762
speed, which is nice but, you know, complexity is complexity.

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:57.500
On AsciiChan we probably don't need to do this right now

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.870
our site just isn't at that scale. It doesn't, you

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.670
know, a cache stampede isn't a realistic threat because we don't

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.500
have that many users. But if we did, this is the kind of

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.060
approach we'd want to take and, and so this is kind of the name of

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.100
the game when caching. You know, if you want to keep this cache totally accurate

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.730
without doing database rights, we're going to have

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.770
to do, you know, complex code. So,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.170
one thing to keep in mind the more accurate the cache, the more complex

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.320
the code. And these are the decisions you'll make as you build your website.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.720
And as you're scaling, you know, this

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.150
is probably the ultimate solution you want to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.719
look to when you're kind of caching a database. You know, if the, if the

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:28.560
solution works for you.
