00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.130
Agent-based simulations are richer
in attributes than discrete event

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.860
simulations.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.850
And agents can interact with each
other and their environment.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.410
We'll look at an example of one
of these from Georgia Tech,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.470
a simulation of the Center for Health
Discovery and Well-Being, a novel clinic

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.460
whose objective was to identify and
mediate risks of future chronic disease.
