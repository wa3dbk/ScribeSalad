00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.020
Let's start with a table view
from the iOS Health app.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.080
Here's the table for Health Data.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.730
If we dissect the content view for

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.610
each cell, we see a UI ImageView,
a UI Label, and another UI ImageView.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.410
Here in the Maps app,
you can see that as I type,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.840
the table is rapidly being repopulated.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.670
But, the components of the small views,
the magnifying glass icon,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.740
the placement of the text,
those are repeating.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.890
In both Health Kit and Maps, you see
an image here on the left margin.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400
And, you see the same
font in the text field.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.430
These top views are instances
of the same view class.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.500
The Search bar is a stock
view that we're going to use,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.860
as well, in our practice apps.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.240
If I return to the map of San Francisco,
and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.710
drop a pin on Golden Gate Park, clicking
that pin gives me another table view.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.570
Here the cell separators are similar
to the ones we just saw.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.030
But, there are no image views,
and each cell contains a button.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.690
Here in my contacts, the table cell
views are separated into sections.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.950
But, in this lesson, we're just
going to stick to one section.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.565
Here, in the albums table of the photos
app, we see a similar structure.

00:01:04.565 --> 00:01:07.323
But, the smaller views
are formatted a little differently.

00:01:07.323 --> 00:01:12.695
The image views are larger, and we see
two labels with custom font sizes.

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:16.355
Stop for a moment, and think about
which of the pixels on this screen

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.615
are actually drawn for
the table view, per say.

00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:23.540
Because, the screen is filled up
with these smaller repeating views,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.430
the pixels that are being drawn
are contained in the smaller views.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.840
These small repeating
views are called cells,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.920
they're subclasses of UI TableViewCell,
which is a UI view.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.540
Tables tile the cell views
vertically and draw in separators.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.636
Think about the different tables and
their similarities.

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:44.590
What kind of data is necessary
to populate a table?
