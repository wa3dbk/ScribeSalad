00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.600
The first thing I want to say about
high performance computing is that it's

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.200
the dumbest name ever.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.900
I mean, like seriously?

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.790
High performance?

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.453
As opposed to what exactly?

00:00:11.453 --> 00:00:13.977
Low performance?

00:00:13.977 --> 00:00:15.781
Unfavourable performance?

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.653
Sober performance?

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:21.840
2.5 out of 4 stars performance?

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.510
So I went and I talked to a bunch of my
colleagues from all over the world, and

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.898
I asked each one of them,
what do you think about HPC?

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:31.588
One of them, John Shalf, from Lawrence
Berkeley National Labs, had this to say.

00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:33.933
&gt;&gt; Well first off,
I like to call it super computing.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.840
HPC sounds kind of boring.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.980
Super computing, now that is compelling.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.850
&gt;&gt; Well said, John.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.290
I couldn't agree more.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.995
So with that, let's go super compute.

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.144
