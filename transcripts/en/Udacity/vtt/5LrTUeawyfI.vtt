00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
For this question, you're asked to produce a list of words from a string,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is separated either by white space or tags.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You've got to strip out all the tags.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We have tags here, here, here, here and here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, we can't just remove the tags completely, because then we'd have

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Title" and this written as one word, and we don't want that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to remove the tags.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm going to search for the first tag, the opening tag and the closing tag,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and then I'm going to remove the whole of the tag.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But I'm not just going to remove it. I'm going to replace it with a space,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because replacing it by a space means that I don't have the problem with things like

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
"Titlethis" being run into one word.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Once I've got all the tags replaced by spaces, I'm going to use the split

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that we've used before, which splits on white space.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Having several spaces in a row is not a problem,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
because split removes the lot of them.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now to look at how to code that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We're asked to define a function remove_tag.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It takes a string as its input, and what I'm going to do first is I'm going to look for

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the start position in the string--the start position of the first opening bracket.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm also going to need to find the end of the bracket--the end of the same tag.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Just to be on the safe side, make sure I find the right one, I'm going to start by looking at the start position.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'm going to start the find from the initial opening bracket

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and so I'll find the next closing bracket.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Now, that would find the first tag, but I'm going to have to do this multiple times

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if there is more than one tag in the string.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:09.000
While I have an opening tag--remember, if we have the string we're looking for non found,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
then it returns -1.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
As soon as we haven't got -1, we're going to keep looking for the tags and removing them.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now to actually remove the tag, I'm going to break the string up.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'm going to take the part before the tag and the part afterwards and joint them together.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'm going to take the string up to start.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, this will actually exclude the opening tag, because it ends at one position less than start.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'll replace the tag with a space and then I'll put the rest of the string after the tag at the end.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now, I'll start at one position after the end, because end is the position of the closing tag,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and we don't want to include that.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Now I've got a new string. I'm going to see if I've got another tag that I'm going to have to remove.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'm going to look for the next opening tag.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If I find an opening tag when it comes to the top of the while loop, it'll go through again.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If I don't find another opening tag, the while look will finish.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
In that case, I want to return the string but not just the string.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I want it split into individual words.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Then I'm just going to split, and that almost completes the code,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
except that I've misnamed the procedure and called it "remove_tag"

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
instead of remove_tags. And now we're done.
