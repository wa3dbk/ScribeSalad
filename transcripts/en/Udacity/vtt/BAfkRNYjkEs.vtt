00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.903
Now, what if we have something like this function? f of x equals 6x squared

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:09.110
minus 7x minus 5. Once again, our leading coefficient, the coefficient of the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.223
highest degree term, is not equal to 1. It's 6. Unfortunately, this time, our

00:00:14.223 --> 00:00:19.146
situation's not as easily solvable as last time. We can't just factor out a 6

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:23.283
from each of our terms, since it's not a common factor. Well, what do we do

00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:27.658
now? I'll tell you already what the factors are. There 2x plus 1 and 3x minus

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:31.359
5. But how do we find those? That's what we're going to look at next.
