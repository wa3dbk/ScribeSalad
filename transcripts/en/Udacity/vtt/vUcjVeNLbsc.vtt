00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's look at what the forward Euler method does to this equation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
X after the first step will be the initial value of x plus the time step

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
times the rate of change at the initial time plus the rate of change at times 0.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What's the rate of change at times 0? It's -kx(0).

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We can factor out x or 0 and end up with this expression.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's the result after the first times step.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The initial value gets multiplied by 1 minus step size times the constant that appears in the test equation.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Now, let's do the second step--it's x at the end of the previous step

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
plus h times the rate of change at that time or actually our estimate of that rate of change

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
at that time which would be -kx(h), again we can factor out and we can plug in the value of x(h)

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
from the first step, so we end up with (1-hk) times now x(h),

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.000
(1-hk) x(0) which is if we combine these two, (1-hk)² x(0)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and you see how this is going to proceed if you go to (3h), this will become (4h)^4 and so on.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The question was whether or not x is going to approach 0.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This boils down to whether or not (1-hk)ⁿ approaches 0 as n times to infinity.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So what happens to the nth power of (1-hk), we are interested in how large h the step size can be?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If the step size h gets large, the expression inside the parenthesis

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
becomes negative, we are subtracting from 1.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
If we are subtracting more than 1, the inner term here gets negative.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So the question here is what happens to powers of negative numbers to some huge power.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
As an example, what happens if the inner expression equals -2

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and we take the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and so on power.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:17.000
(-2)¹ is -2. (-2)² is 4. (-2)³ is -8. (-2)⁴ is 16 and so on which means that this expression,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the nth power would explode and this is precisely not what we want for a stable solution.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So let's try a different number. So what would happen if the inner expression was -0.9,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and we took powers of (-0.9). (-0.9)¹ is 0.9. (-0.9)² is 0.81. (-0.9)³ is -0.723. (-0.9)⁴ is 0.6561.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Each time, we are losing 10% in magnitude but you see that the sign keeps changing,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
minus, plus, minus, plus, so this indeed decays to 0 but in a strange fashion. It oscillates.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
You may remember this behavior from the SEIR model that we simulated before.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
If this expression would equal -0.99, it would still see decay with this sort of oscillation.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If it would equal -0.999, this would still work but become very, very slow.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So the threshold would be that (1-hk) is in the expression equals -1.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The threshold, it's 2/k. So the condition is h is smaller than 2/k for this power to decay to 0

00:03:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and for the forward Euler method to be stable.
