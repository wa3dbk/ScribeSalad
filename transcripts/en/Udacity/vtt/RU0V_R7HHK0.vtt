00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.318
&gt;&gt; Now, in the process of needing to fill our canvas tiles, the method of

00:00:03.318 --> 00:00:07.091
drawing is a little bit different than what we were doing before. Previously,

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:10.726
we're actually just taking a view rect and actually filling the data in. But

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:14.502
now, what we need to do is actually take that same logic, which we've actually

00:00:14.502 --> 00:00:18.416
re-factored for you here. And instead of drawing it based upon the view rect, we

00:00:18.416 --> 00:00:22.310
need to modify it to render tiles into the CanvasTile boundaries that are being

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.120
passed into the function. This works that once each of your CanvasTiles have

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.837
been created, you can actually pass it off to the fillCanvasTile function,

00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:33.786
giving it the newly created CanvasTile. Now, the code that we've provided here

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:37.809
is essentially the same as our previous draw code, just refactored. The primary

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.579
difference is that our fillCanvasTile code should now take a CanvasTile, as a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.356
parameter, and then draw to that CanvasTile's context. Using its bounding

00:00:45.356 --> 00:00:48.110
information, rather than our primary canvas context.
