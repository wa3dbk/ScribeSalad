00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And the answer is: &amp; =&amp; amp;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And so this translates something like this:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
this portion turns into an ampersand,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
this portion turns into an ampersand,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and this portion is just text,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So that's what we get--nice work!
