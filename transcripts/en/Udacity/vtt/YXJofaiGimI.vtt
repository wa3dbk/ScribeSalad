00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.250
An ArrayList collects objects. We call those objects the elements of the list.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.742
Here's one way of thinking about an ArrayList. You can think of it as a

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:14.320
sequence of mailboxes. Here is how you get an element out of an ArrayList.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.050
Remember that gallery was an ArrayList of pictures. The get method can get a

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.545
picture out of that collection. The argument of the get method is called an

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:32.070
index and as it happens in Java the index values start with zero. So the first

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.110
element is at position zero. The second element is at position one, the third

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.693
at position two and so on. The get method returns the elements stored at the

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:47.330
index position. In our case that's the initial element and we store that in

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.414
this variable. What if we wanted to get at the last element? Then we need to

00:00:52.414 --> 00:00:57.166
know how many elements are stored in the ArrayList at this time. The size

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:01.944
method tells us that. So gallery.size is the number of elements that's

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.465
currently stored in this particular ArrayList. Since the first index is zero,

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:12.585
the last index is one less than the size. Look at over here. This list here has

00:01:12.585 --> 00:01:18.090
length five and the last element has index four. Now once we have the last

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.270
index, we can again use the get method passing at the last index to get the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.450
last element out of here. Here you've seen how to access elements individually.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.900
More often than not, we actually want to access all of the elements in a loop.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.590
So let's have a look at that. In order to work with every element in an

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.607
ArrayList, you want to call the get method for every valid index. That means

00:01:40.607 --> 00:01:47.324
zero, one, two and so on up to the size minus one. So here's what we need to

00:01:47.324 --> 00:01:52.273
put into our four loop. I starts at zero. It get incremented at every step and

00:01:52.273 --> 00:01:57.526
we stay in the loop while i is less than the size of the ArrayList. So this is

00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:02.483
the classic loop to traverse all of the elements in an ArrayList. I takes every

00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:07.009
legal index value, for each i we get the element stored in the ArrayList and

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.688
then we do something with that element. You will get to try that right now. Go

00:02:12.688 --> 00:02:17.801
ahead and write a loop that draws every picture in the gallery.
