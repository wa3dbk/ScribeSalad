00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.940
We know a fractional exponent represents power divided by root, so this first

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.536
one will be the cube root of r squared, we have r squared here since the power

00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:13.635
is 2 and we take the third root since our denominator is 3. For our second

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.417
example, we take the 3rd root of 4x, we don't need to write this exponent of 1

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:21.199
in here since anything raised to the 1st power is the same expression, 4x to

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:28.310
the 1 really equals 4x. For this third one we also have power divided by root.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.872
So we take the third root of this expression raised to the 4th power. You might

00:00:32.872 --> 00:00:36.518
have distributed this 4th power to each of the factors inside of a radical. And

00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:41.298
you would wind up with this radical. Either one is correct. It turns out that

00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:45.109
we can simplify this radical but weren't getting into that yet. We're do that

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.680
in the next lesson. The other way you could have written the answer is like

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.730
this, you could have take the cube root of 5ab squared c and then raise that

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.836
quantity to the 4th power. We can take the root first and then raise the result

00:00:56.836 --> 00:01:00.490
to the 4th power or we can raise this expression to the 4th power and then take

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.972
the 3rd root. This is true because the exponent of 4 and the exponent of one

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:10.908
third have the same priority in the order of operations. A root really

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:15.673
represents a type of exponent so we could do either exponent first.
