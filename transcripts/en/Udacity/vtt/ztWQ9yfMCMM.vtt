00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.855
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The first step we need to take, and this is actually a little bit tricky, is

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.949
to recognize that we have a term of 24x squared on both sides of the equation.

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:12.161
That means, if we subtracted from both sides, we'll just get rid of it entirely.

00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:16.315
That's definitely going to make our lives simpler. Now, I'm going to move all of

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:20.262
my x terms, so that they're on the left side of the equation. And all of my

00:00:20.262 --> 00:00:25.119
constant terms, so that they're on the right. All that's left to do is divide

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.885
both sides by 60. Recognizing that 38 and 60 are both divisible by 2, we can

00:00:29.885 --> 00:00:34.748
cancel out that common factor, and get a final answer of x equals 19 over 30.

00:00:34.748 --> 00:00:39.990
Awesome. I know that was a really, pretty intricate and complicated equation to

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.114
solve. But look at where we came from. We started off with all of these messy

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:48.079
fractions, and we ended up with, well, an answer that is a fraction, but it's an

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.192
answer nonetheless. I'd like you to plug this answer into the places of x in the

00:00:52.192 --> 00:00:56.590
original equation, to make sure that it actually works. Please remember to check

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.425
the left hand side on its own, and the right hand side on its own, and then

00:01:00.425 --> 00:01:01.340
compare the two.
