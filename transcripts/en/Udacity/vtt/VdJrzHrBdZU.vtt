00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.254
We saw before that log base 10 of 2 times 3 is equal to log base 10 of 2, plus

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:11.484
log base 10 of 3. So that means that if we have log base 10 of 5 times 5 then,

00:00:11.484 --> 00:00:15.644
according to the product property, this should equal log base 10 of 5, plus log

00:00:15.644 --> 00:00:22.655
base 10 of 5. However, we're just adding 2 log based 10 of 5s together. And we

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:28.770
can see that this is equal to 2 times log base 10 of 5, or 2 log base 10 of 5.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.549
Considering what we've just written, how do you think you could rewrite log

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.160
base 10 of 5 times 5 times 5? Please follow this same pattern that we did up

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.870
here. So what belongs in this slot should be similar to what's in this form.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.839
And this answer should be in the same form as this one.
