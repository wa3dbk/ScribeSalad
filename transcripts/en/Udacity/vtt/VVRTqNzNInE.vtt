00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.434
Back at the glasses expo, Grant has noticed what awesome flashy displays some of

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:08.700
the other vendors have. He just got his little glasses wipers and his little

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.809
sign. Investing in some advertising seems like a really great idea for his

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.185
business. Unfortunately, Grant runs into a woman who works for an ad agency and

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:21.950
she guarantees with her agency's help, Grant can make $5,000 in just 2 weeks. Of

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.586
course, there is a price to pay. That will cost Grant $2,000 to work with them.

00:00:26.586 --> 00:00:31.118
If we assume that Grant earns money at a constant rate or in other words that

00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:35.698
the graph of profit versus time is a linear graph and a linear equation. How

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:40.483
long will it take Grant to break even? That's what we want to figure out. Let's

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:45.082
say that x is equal to the number of days since the answer released, and let's

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:49.996
say that y is equal to Grant's profit in dollars. Thinking about the information

00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:54.417
that the problem gave us, what two points we know lie on our line? Note also,

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:57.376
that making $5,000 means making a profit of $5,000.
