Welcome back, everybody.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.705
Today we have Allan with us here.

00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:05.700
Allan, describe some problems when
you're first working with a framework.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.570
What did you experience?

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.690
&gt;&gt; When you're first learning a
framework there's a lot of overhead that

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.034
you need to learn that's
specific to the framework.

00:00:13.034 --> 00:00:14.990
I mean,
it's not just like learning a language.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.150
Take for example AngularJS.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.770
Even if you are an expert in JavaScript,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
you can't start off right off
the bat developing AngularJS.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.350
There's some nuances or a caveats or

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.240
things that are done differently
within those different frameworks.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.642
Like for example, AngularJS has
different modules, factories.

00:00:31.642 --> 00:00:36.201
It's interesting, for some frameworks,
in order to print, hello world,

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:39.646
to display on a web page,
you need multiple lines of code.

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:43.319
Whereas like if you're just dealing
with straight HTML, CSS and

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.536
JavaScript it's pretty simple to do.

00:00:45.536 --> 00:00:47.756
&gt;&gt; So for students that are just
starting out into the world of

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:49.615
frameworks and
trying to learn their first one,

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:51.320
what would be some
advice you'd give them?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.220
&gt;&gt; I would say,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.649
first and foremost, you need to be
very comfortable with the language.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.560
Each framework kind of ships,
or usually ships,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.510
with their own DSL or
domain specific language.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.760
But if you don't understand the base
language, you're incurring a lot

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.580
of technical debt,
professionally as well as personally.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.827
As far as advice to extend
generally to any framework and

00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:16.458
students jumping into it, another thing
I would recommend is definitely do not

00:01:16.458 --> 00:01:18.960
be afraid to jump into
the documentation.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.670
It's supposed to be your mainstream or
largely-supported frameworks.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.900
The documentation is excellent.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.260
Take for example,
AngularJS or Ruby on Rails.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.461
You should have that bookmarked and
always, always visit it.

00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.679
I mean, if the documentation's
good then most of your

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.436
questions will be answered there.

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.920
&gt;&gt; So you've worked with
a couple of frameworks.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.270
&gt;From learning your first one, what was
it like transitioning to a new one?

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.910
&gt;&gt; A good question, so when you're
transitioning frameworks, you don't

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.960
lose all the knowledge that you gained
from learning that initial framework.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.310
And part of the value of learning
frameworks is that a lot of the best

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.281
practices are kind of built in,
if not forced

00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:06.100
on you with configuration,
or with convention, rather.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.940
And so you're able to translate
a lot of those best practices

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:10.788
to other frameworks.

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:15.180
Or even if you don't have a framework,
you can build your application

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.840
with some of those best practices that
you learned from previous frameworks.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.930
Okay, so learning your first framework
might be a little tough, but

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.600
then the slide is a lot easier for
learning a new one.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a lot of
design patterns that are common

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.040
throughout frameworks.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.280
For example, MVC, model-view-controller,
that's something that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.680
exists across most of our front-end
frameworks or our full-side frameworks.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.015
&gt;&gt; Okay, so learning your first
one might be a big push, but

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.641
then after that, then it's a lot
easier to switch to a new one and

00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:45.262
learn a different style of framework.

00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:47.120
&gt;&gt; For sure,
every framework's different.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.660
They all have their different nuances
and caveats, but the general themes and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.220
best practices are pretty
consistent across all of them.
