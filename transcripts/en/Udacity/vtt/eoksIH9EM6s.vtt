00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.160
Now let's look at the solution for our MOVZ MOVN Performance Quiz.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.420
The fact that this branch is 50% taken means that on average,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.910
we execute half of the time three instructions and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.290
half of the time two instructions. So if we perfectly predict this,

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:21.950
we will be executing 2.5 instructions on average per execution of this code.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.210
In contrast here, we get four instructions, but we cannot have mis-predictions.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.090
However, here we have our misprediction rate times a 30 instruction penalty.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.160
And if the misprediction is such that these two are equal, then this would be

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.735
equal to 4. Then, our x, the misprediction rate, needs to be 4 minus 2.5,

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:50.970
leaves us with 1.5 instructions worth of advantage here.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.330
And 30 instructions worth of disadvantage if we mispredict. So in order for

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.622
them to balance, the misprediction rate needs to be 0.05, which amounts to 5%.

00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:07.916
So pretty much, if the prediction accuracy is below 95%, then if

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:13.711
converted code is better. If the prediction accuracy in this case is above 95%,

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:19.110
then the original code is better. If the misprediction accuracy is exactly 95%,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410
then the two have equal performance.
