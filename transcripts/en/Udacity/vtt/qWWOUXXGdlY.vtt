00:00:00.087 --> 00:00:04.102
So now that you've had a fair amount of
practice with the distributive property,

00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:07.776
I'm going to give you a challenge problem.
In fact, I'm going to officially declare

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.703
that this is a challenge problem by
writing challenge and I'll give you a few

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:16.875
exclamation points just to reinforce my
point that I think this is really hard.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:21.662
Here's a pretty complicated expression if
I do say so myself. We have x plus 4 minus

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.602
3 x times the entire quantity, y plus 5
minus 2x plus 7x to the 2nd, and then

00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:29.774
subtract it from all of that, 6y. So, this
is gross and messy but. So, this is gross

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:35.856
and messy but. you have all the tools that
you need to simplify this and make it look

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:40.690
relatively pretty. So take your time,
write everything out on paper, and

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.689
seriously, make sure that you don't skip
any steps. Or, at least I know, that when

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:50.239
I did this problem, if I hadn't written
anything down, I would have made a bunch

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.039
of mistakes. So, take your time. Good
luck.
