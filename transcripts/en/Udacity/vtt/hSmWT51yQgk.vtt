00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.140
Enter LibGDX.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.150
LibGDX is a Java game engine
an application framework

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.780
that makes making games so much easier.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.560
It provides a bunch of useful
functionality, including great

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.060
drawing APIs, sound and asset handling,
user input management and

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.660
a ton of other features that
make writing a game super fast.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.830
LibGDX does one better though.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.120
Games written for LibGDX can be
deployed on Android, IOS, browsers,

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.470
and anywhere else the Java runs,
like your desktop computer.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.280
So, let's check out how LibGDX works.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.130
Up at the top of the stack here, here's
your game, and then here is LibGDX.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.020
LibGDX provides a bunch of functionality
related to calling into your game when

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.530
it's time to do stuff.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.090
But it also provides all of these
libraries for drawing, sound, storage,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.970
networking, a bunch of other stuff.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.120
So when your game needs
to draw something,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.760
you call into LibGDX to ask it
to go draw something for you.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.880
Now whenever you call a library
to go do some drawing for

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.180
you, that library doesn't
actually do the drawing itself.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.830
It delegates that task to the underlying
hardware it's running on.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.770
So, either that it talks to
the video card driver directly, or

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.090
it talks to some other abstraction
offered by the host operating system.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.520
So here's the trick.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.395
When LibGDX receives a request to
go draw something, it can go and

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:21.270
dispatch that command to an Android
system it's running on, but

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.302
it also knows how to tell if it's
running on iOS instead of Android.

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:29.360
It will dispatch a different
set of drawing commands to iOS.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.695
Or LibGDX has an HTML backend, where
when your game requests some networking

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:37.506
to be done, LibGDX Intel,
I'm running as a web app this time.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:41.809
I'm going to go do my networking using
a different set of commands than I would

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:43.740
if I was on Android or iOS.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.050
And LibGDX has a background that
runs on desktop computers as well.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.480
So, the APIs that your game uses, look
identical to you, regardless of whether

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.940
your game is running on Android, iOS, as
a web app, or on your desktop computer.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.840
That means you only need
to write your game once and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.590
LibGDX will allow it to run anywhere.
