00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.617
So having one box that we've made, or one model building that we've made is

00:00:03.617 --> 00:00:08.665
great, but I chose a certain size that I wanted these squares to be. So I'm

00:00:08.665 --> 00:00:12.810
wondering what's going to happen if I choose a different sized square. Let's

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.288
see. Maybe to start out my experiment, I'll make a rectangle that has little

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:21.281
tiny, tiny, tiny squares cut out of the corners.

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:23.790

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.213
So now that I have my tiny squares cut out, I'm going to cut out some really

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:36.686
big ones. Actually, I'm going to consider, first of all, this box as our

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:42.319
medium-sized corner box. And for comparison, I'm just going to take that tape

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:43.870
off of it.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.706
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:48.706 --> 00:00:54.598
. So medium one is back. Now for the really big one, or rather the really big

00:00:54.598 --> 00:00:56.135
corners.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:56.453
[BLANK_AUDIO].

00:00:56.453 --> 00:01:01.317
So now, we have three very different looking rectangles with the corners cut

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:06.812
out of them. And the question I have for you and something that Athena's

00:01:06.812 --> 00:01:11.420
wondering is which one of these has the biggest volume when it's folded into a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.230
box? Or in other words, which one's going to hold the most M&amp;amp;M's? Clearly we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.490
want the box that's going to hold the most M &amp;amp; M's. So pick between these three

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.530
boxes.
