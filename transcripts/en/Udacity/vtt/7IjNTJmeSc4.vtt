The final factor of attraction is the psychological factor. Many of us know

00:00:05.352 --> 00:00:09.104
that it's not just physical attractiveness or beauty that goes into finding the

00:00:09.104 --> 00:00:13.577
perfect mate. There's something else that makes a person, well special. For

00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:18.904
example what are their attitudes and beliefs? What's their personality like? Do

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:22.628
you agree with their points of view? Are they ambitious? These are inner

00:00:22.628 --> 00:00:28.466
qualities that many people find very attractive. In fact, research shows that

00:00:28.466 --> 00:00:32.744
we tend to marry people with similar socioeconomic status, ethnicities,

00:00:32.744 --> 00:00:39.594
religious background, personalities, and level of education. So it seems that

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:43.070
similarities also play an important role in attraction.
