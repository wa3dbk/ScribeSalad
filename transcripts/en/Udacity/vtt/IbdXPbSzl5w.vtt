00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.157
In Android 4.4 KitKat or API level 19,

00:00:03.157 --> 00:00:08.800
Android started getting really
serious about coordinated motion.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.930
The new scenes and
transitions API made it much

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.160
easier to define how UI
elements should move together.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.680
Let's take a look.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.580
The scenes and transitions API
introduced a new paradigm for

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.690
animating objects in your UI.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.320
James gave you a glimpse into this API,
but

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.920
it actually let's you
do a whole lot more.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.995
The API allows you to define different
states for your UI, called scenes.

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.930
There's actually two scenes
in this example here.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.910
And also, let you define ways to
transition between those scenes,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.720
coordinating several
UI elements at once.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.170
So, when UI elements appear,
disappear, move,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.000
or otherwise change, you could
easily define the animations to use.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.150
In this example, you can see
some of those elements moving,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.400
some elements appearing,
and some disappearing.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.980
Pressing the info or close button,
switches between those two scenes.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.941
The way this works, is you have two
layouts which describe the two scenes.

00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.420
Here's what they look like.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.600
They're pretty simple,
just some linear layouts,

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.770
some relative layouts, image views,
text views, and buttons.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.710
Now the magic happens here
in the onClick handlers.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.004
When you press the info button,
we use this new TransitionManager class,

00:01:23.004 --> 00:01:25.865
to change from the current
scene to the other one,

00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:28.064
as defined by the second layout file.

00:01:28.064 --> 00:01:30.088
If we don't specify anything else,

00:01:30.088 --> 00:01:34.020
Android will automatically figure
out some nice transitions for you.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.748
Moving elements shared
between the scenes.

00:01:36.748 --> 00:01:40.710
Fading new elements in, and
fading old elements out.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.800
But let's say we wanted to
customize the transition.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900
We could do things like
stagger the transition so

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.450
that not everything happens all at once.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.034
For that, you could your describe
custom transitions in XML, and

00:01:52.034 --> 00:01:55.400
pass them into the TransitionManager,
like so.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.010
And here's an example of
the custom transition XML.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.920
There's some similarities with the
animation XML we talked about before.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.480
But the primitives you're working with,

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.560
like changeBounds and
fade, are a bit different.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.580
As you can see, the animation
capabilities in Android have been

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.340
evolving, from basic
animations in early Android

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.180
to much richer capabilities in Ice
Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.090
Let's go to Nick,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.877
who will tell us about the new animation
capabilities in Android 5.0, Lollipop.
