Try solving this equation. What do you think is the value for x here? You'll

00:00:03.996 --> 00:00:08.092
need to remember something about flipping bases. There's a certain type of

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:11.264
exponent, or a value of an exponent, that can flip or do the reciprocal of a

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:15.240
base. You'll use that to solve this problem.
