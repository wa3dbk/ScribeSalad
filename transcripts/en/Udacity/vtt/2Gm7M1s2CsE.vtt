00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We need an input function that will return the command to be executed.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If these were an interactive program, that is if we would run this in a console on our own machine,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
this is the command to be used until we could interact with it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is what you can use on your own machine in order to get your debugger to work.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In this web IDE, however, such an interactive program does not work,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
so we need to simulate this.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So what we have here is, I have set up a list of predefined commands to execute.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In here, this would be step, step, and quit, and we're using the method pop(0)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to return the first element of the command list and at the same time also

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to remove the first element from the commands list.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So the command is now missing its quit, so we have to add this.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If we have a command that starts with quit, we call sys.exit of 0--meaning that our debugger exits.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
All is set now--initially, we do not step through the program,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but we have a breakpoint in line 9 and in line 14.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We want to execute three commands--step, step, and quit.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
What should happen is that execution is normal until it reaches line 9,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
then we step through two more lines and then we quit the program.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's see whether this actually works and indeed--it has worked exactly as we wanted.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
First, we reached line 9, then we step--we reached line 11, then we step--we reached line 13,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and then we quit and this is precisely the output we would have expected.
