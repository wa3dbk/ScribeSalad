00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.496
Okay, let's see how you did. We have negative 4 squared. Well, negative 4

00:00:04.496 --> 00:00:11.537
squared, since the negative is not inside any parentheses, means it's not part

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.601
of the base. So, this is going to be negative 1 times 4 squared, and then we

00:00:16.613 --> 00:00:21.730
have negative 1. 4 squared, I know is 4 times 4. 4 times 4 is 16, so I have

00:00:21.742 --> 00:00:27.531
negative 1 times 16, give me -16. Okay let's try number 2. This time I have the

00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:34.016
negative inside the parenthesis, so that means my base is megative 3. So this

00:00:34.028 --> 00:00:39.559
ones going to be negative 3 squared, which is -3 times -3. And we know -3 times

00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:47.191
-3 gives us a positive 9. Now the 1st 2 problems had even exponents, let's try

00:00:47.203 --> 00:00:54.431
these 2 with odd exponents. The 1st problem I have -2 cubed, which means -1

00:00:54.443 --> 00:01:00.852
times 2 cubed. -1 times 2 cubed is -1 times 2 times 2 times 2, and 2 times 2

00:01:00.864 --> 00:01:06.224
times 2 is 8, so I have negative 1 times 8, which is going to give me negative

00:01:06.236 --> 00:01:11.729
8. OK, number four. This time, like in number two, I have the negative 3 in

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:17.383
parentheses, which means it's part of our base. So, negative 3 cubed is just

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:22.760
negative 3 times negative 3 Times negative 3. Negative 3 times negative 3 is

00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:27.674
positive 9, positive 9 times negative 3 is negative 27. If I look at number 2

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:32.638
and number 4, I have a negative number as the base. In number 2, if you notice

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.671
the exponent here is even. When we raise a negative number to an even power the

00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:42.449
answer is going to be positive. And number 4 we have a negative number being

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:47.359
raised to an odd power. Whenever we raise negative numbers to an odd power, the

00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:52.106
answer is going to be negative. It's something you can keep in mind. For number

00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:57.041
5, notice we have a negative exponent. We know if we have a negative exponent we

00:01:57.053 --> 00:02:02.183
have to take the reciprocal of base, so 5 to the negative 2 is 5 over 1 to the

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:07.711
negative 2 because we can rewrite 5 as 5 over 1 and when we take the reciprocal

00:02:07.723 --> 00:02:13.295
that's the negative one fifth and we get rid off the negative once we take that

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:18.811
reciprocal of the base, notice once I take the reciprocal I get rid of the

00:02:18.823 --> 00:02:24.051
negative exponent. So we have 1/5 squared, which is 1/5 times 1/ 5. And that's

00:02:24.063 --> 00:02:27.945
going to be 1 times 1 is 1. And 5 times 5 is 25. So, 5 to the negative 2 is

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:33.964
1/25. Think about how you did. How many did you get right and wrong? Decide if

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:40.021
you need to go back and review the material again, before moving on to the next

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:40.662
section.
