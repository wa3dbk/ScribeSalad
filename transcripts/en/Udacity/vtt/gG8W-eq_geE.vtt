00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.225
Alright. So, let's see how we can add 1/3 of strawberry icing and 1/2 of vanilla

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:10.125
icing together. I need a way to compare 1/3 and 1/2 of the cake. If I cut the

00:00:10.137 --> 00:00:14.725
cake into equal size pieces for both of them, then I could add the parts

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:19.659
together. Let's split up our cake into sixths. I'm going to split every third

00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:24.896
into to two equal parts. Doing that, I can see I get 2/6 of the cake is covered

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:30.437
in strawberry icing. So, how did I get from 1/3 to 2/3? We doubled the number of

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.552
pieces we had altogether, I went from 3 pieces to 6. So, I know I needed to

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:40.930
multiply the denominator by 2. I also doubled the number of pieces I had. I had

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:46.100
1 out of 3 and now, I have 2 out of 6. Notice I'm multiplying by the number 1, 2

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:50.735
divided by 2 is still 1. I'm just changing what this fraction looks like, I'm

00:00:50.747 --> 00:00:56.220
not changing its value. We can still see 1/3 is 2/6. I'm going to use the same

00:00:56.232 --> 00:01:01.489
approach to make 1/2 into sixths. I'm going to split up this cake into 6. To

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:06.413
change from halves to sixths, I need to multiply by 3 over 3. I know 2 times 3

00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:11.610
gives me 6. And then for the numerator, 1 times 3 is 3. Visually, I can see that

00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:16.045
1/2 of the cake frosted in vanilla icing is the same as 3/6 of the cake also

00:01:16.057 --> 00:01:20.370
frosted in vanilla icing. I multiplied by 1 here, so I'm not changing the value

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:24.660
of this fraction, I'm just changing what it looks like. Now that I have my cake

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:28.880
split up into sixths, I have 2/6 of it frosted in strawberry, and 3/6 of it

00:01:28.892 --> 00:01:32.845
frosted in vanilla icing. Now, I can just add my sixths together. I have the

00:01:32.857 --> 00:01:37.515
same sized pieces, so I can just count them up. I can see that 2/6 and 3/6,

00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:43.509
altogether, makes 5/6. And here's what it would look like on one cake. I have

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:49.428
half of it covered in vanilla icing and 1/3 of it covered in strawberry icing.

00:01:49.553 --> 00:01:55.130
This would be 1/6 of the cake, 2/6 of the cake, 3/6 of the cake, 4/6 of the

00:01:55.142 --> 00:02:00.082
cake, and 5/6 of the cake. So, when my fractions were just 1/3 and 1/2, I

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:04.980
couldn't add them together. I had to get a common denominator first. I had to

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:09.902
get them into the same size pieces. So, how do I add fract ions together once I

00:02:09.914 --> 00:02:13.302
have a common denominator? Let's try this with a quiz.
