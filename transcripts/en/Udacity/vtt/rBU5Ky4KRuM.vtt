00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.010
So how would we go about to reduce SAT to shortest tour,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.510
or how do you generally go about showing NP-completeness

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.250
when the 2 problems that you have are not related to each other?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.800
So let's briefly just restate what the SAT problem is and the shortest tour problem,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.280
and then let's try to relate the 2 to each other.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.080
SAT was a problem where you were given as input a Boolean formula,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.580
and the output or question was, does the formula have a satisfying assignment?

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.320
And of course that is a yes or no question

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.860
because we're dealing with a decision problem here.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.700
And shortest tour, that's easy to remember

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.730
because we talked about it a lot so far in this course.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.170
The input was a graph with distances, and we said we need a number d

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.700
in order to make this a decision problem,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.560
and the question here was, is there a tour of length at most d?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.610
And by tour we mean that we want to visit all vertices at least once,

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.710
but we can visit them more than once.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.600
So now comes the creative part.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.400
How on earth are we going to take a Boolean formula

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.010
and turn this into a problem related to mail delivery?

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.790
And it's not obvious.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.610
So what I always find useful to do in these cases is to just write down all the properties

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.840
that a Boolean formula has, that a satisfying assignment has--

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.530
so anything I can think of for SAT--

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.360
and then write down properties of the shortest tour problem

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.200
and see if I can find a certain relationship between them,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.610
because oftentimes that will give me an idea of how to accomplish a reduction like this.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.240
So let's see. Properties of SAT.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.630
The first one is each variable is set to either true or false but not both.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.910
So it's either true or false.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.930
And these are all trivial properties, but let's see if they help us.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.080
And actually, deciding whether a variable should be true or false

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.970
is what makes this problem hard.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.740
So I can also write that down.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.730
So deciding this true or false for each variable is what makes SAT hard.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.540
Then what you will also remember is that when we talk about a Boolean formula,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.940
then we can write it in conjunctive normal form, which is this form here

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.870
where we have a bunch of variables that are combined by an or

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.990
and then brackets around that, then comes an and and then comes again a series of ors

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.890
and then comes an and and so on.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.180
This part here we learned in the last unit was called a clause.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.620
So first of all, if there is a satisfying assignment, each clause must be satisfied.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.880
So how do you satisfy a clause?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.690
Since in a clause, as you remember, we just have ors between the variables,

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.420
this means that 1 single variable, if it's set in the right way--

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.070
so either to true or to false if we have a variable with a not--

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.670
then setting 1 single variable the right way is enough to satisfy that clause.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.580
And so we should probably also write that down.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.450
One variable is enough to satisfy a clause.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.310
Let's see if we can do the same thing for shortest tour.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.890
What are some properties of a shortest tour?

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.290
First of all, every city must be visited at least once

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.330
because otherwise it's not a valid tour.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.450
The main decision we need to make is of course in which order we visit the city.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.670
And once we have visited a city, we can visit it again but we don't have to.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.150
And the final thing is we don't visit a city more than once on purpose.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.000
So at a certain point in time we might want to visit a city once more

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.550
because it's beneficial, but in the shortest tour we wouldn't visit a city more than once

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.530
unless it's necessary.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.000
So I'm going to phrase this as we don't visit a city more than once on purpose.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.880
Now, you might be wondering why I have left the numberings here blank,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.570
and that is because we are now going to have a little quiz here,

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.760
because what I would like you to think about is here we have 4 different properties of SAT

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.680
and here we have 4 different properties of shortest tour.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.530
I would like you to find out which properties of shortest tour

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.990
are most closely related to these properties here of SAT.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.930
This is a bit tricky and subjective, but I think it's very valuable to learn this style of thinking.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.180
So before you hit Next out of frustration, please at least spend a little bit of time

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.940
trying to figure this out, and then enter here the number

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.350
that you think most closely corresponds over here.

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.540
So if I were to say that deciding true or false is what makes SAT hard

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.370
is a close analogy to every city visited at least once,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.860
I would enter a 2 here. But this is actually not a correct answer.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.560
And also I have structured it so that each number here will only appear once.

00:04:29.560 --> 99:59:59.000
So how are these 2 related?
