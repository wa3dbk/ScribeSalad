00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.470
Let's now talk about DNS security. To understand the threats and vulnerabilities

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.970
of DNS, let's take a look at the DNS architecture. So we have a stub resolver

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.690
which issues a query to a caching resolver. At this point, we could have

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.090
a man in the middle attack, or an attacker which observes a query and forges

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.009
a response. If a query goes further than the local caching resolver, say

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.650
for example, to an authoritative name server, an attacker could try to send a

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.440
reply back to that caching resolver before the real reply comes back to try to

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.310
poison, or corrupt, the cache with bogus DNS records for a particular name.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.390
This attack is particularly virulent and we will

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.960
look at a cache poisoning attack in this

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.890
lecture. Masters and slaves can both be spoofed.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.340
Zone files could be corrupted. Updates to the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.130
dynamic update system could also be spoofed. We

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.430
will look at some defenses to cache poisoning,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.400
including the OX20 defense, as well as DNSSEC,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.890
which can protect against some of these spoofing and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830
man in the middle attacks. In addition to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.710
these attacks, we'll look at an attack called

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.220
DNS reflection where the DNS can be used

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.500
to mount a large distributed denial of service attack.
