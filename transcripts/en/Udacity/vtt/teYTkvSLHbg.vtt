00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.390
Since we're working from
a command line only,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.290
we don't have a graphical interface,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.020
it only makes sense that we're currently
residing in some place on this computer.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.320
We're within some directory in which
whatever we type will be executed from.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.860
This is called our working directory.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.027
Whenever you log into a Linux machine
you're automatically placed in your

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:20.141
user's home directory.

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:24.344
We can confirm this by
typing the command, pwd.

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:28.460
As you can see,
the result of this is /home/vagrant.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.210
Let's unpack this a little bit.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.800
The slash is the root
level of the file system.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.160
It's the absolute highest you
can go in a Linux file system.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.380
Everything on the machine
is in some way,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.800
a child of the route level, usually
through a variety of other directories.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.090
Home is a directory you'll find
within all Linux systems, and

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.610
it houses all the home directories
of each user with a few exceptions.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160
If we cd into this directory and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.900
then list its contents,
we'll see that there is a directory for

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.880
each user on this machine,
including our current user, vagrant.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.620
So let's go back into our own home
directory and see what's there.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.379
This is our personal
space to store stuff, but

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.250
the operating system has already
placed a few files there for us.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.230
If we just run ls we
won't get any results, so

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.950
we'll need to provide a few flags
to ls to modify it's behavior.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.390
We'll add the -a flag,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.600
which tells it to show all the files,
including hidden ones.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.240
On a Linux system, any file that begins
with a dot is considered a hidden file.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.030
We're going to add one more
flag to the ls command.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.830
That is the l flag, which will list
the results in long format, and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.690
provide a bit more information.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.140
Now, there's a lot of info here, and
we'll eventually go over most of it.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.210
For now, I want you to just
focus on the first character and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.890
the names themselves.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.840
If the first character is a d,
that's a directory.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.280
If it's a dash, that's a file.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.990
So you can see here that the .ssh and
.cache are both directories.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.540
The rest of these are files.
