00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.812
Let's take a quick closer look at this. So with this image's axis aligned

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:09.660
bounding box, we only need to take into account 4 different values. The minimum

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.130
X Y position, and the maximum XY position. Or the top left corner and the

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.433
bottom right corner. Alright so let's go ahead and code this up. We've got a

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:23.195
function intersect direct here, which you might find somewhat familiar, that

00:00:23.195 --> 00:00:26.900
takes 2 rectangle objects, that have a top left bottom right value, and we need

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.789
to test whether they intersect based on those values.
