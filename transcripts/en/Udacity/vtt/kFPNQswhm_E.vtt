00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.076
There's a number of things you can do, from simply congratulating your

00:00:03.076 --> 00:00:07.770
employees on doing a job, to thanking them for their hard work and devotion.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.550
Now, think about it. Have you ever had a job where you felt like your employer

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.884
didn't value you or your contributions to the organization? Well, allot of us

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:17.842
have and unfortunately you feel less valued and your less likely to be

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:22.773
productive and engaged. On the other hand if you've had a job where you felt

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:26.324
like your employer really did value you and your overall level of satisfaction,

00:00:26.324 --> 00:00:29.663
you're more likely to be a better employee, happy, more productive and more

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.380
invested in the organization.
