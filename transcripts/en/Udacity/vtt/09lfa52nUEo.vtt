00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.003
Here's a list of inequalities for you. And for each one, I'd like you to tell me

00:00:05.003 --> 00:00:10.061
which number it says could be greater, a or b, or neither. And then also, tell

00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:14.357
me if the inequality says that a and b could be equal to one another.
