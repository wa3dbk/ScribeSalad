00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So what happened is our looks something like this.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I left off the other attribute--it's no big deal; our variable (month)

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
gets substituted into the string.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So if: month = "November",

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the string, "November" renders and we get a text box

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that looks like this--which is what we'd expect.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But if (month) equals the string, foo--with a quote in it--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and an angled bracket and some more text,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the string we'll render ends up looking something like this,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
where we substitute this variable into here

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
because the value for (month) is actually this whole string--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
including the quote and the angled bracket, which screwed up our HTML.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So our browser saw this--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it sees an and says: value equals "foo";

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and then it sees a closing quote and a closing angled bracket,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it gets this other string, derp, and it just prints that.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So that's, obviously, not the behavior we want.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The rendered HTML ends up looking--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or in the browser--ends up looking something like this.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You've got a text box with the word "foo" in it,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and then it's just a quote and an angled bracket,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the string, derp, just hanging out there and--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you know--that's not what we intended.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And what's really scary is

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
this allows somebody who knows how our Web site works

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
to not just enter random text,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
but what if they put HTML in our ?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What if, instead of (derp) it was something better?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Let's look at that in our browser.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So we're going to enter our bad data again--and this time,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
we're going to put HTML in there.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay. So this time, I've put in a quote,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
an angled bracket--to close our tag,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and then I've put some HTML--a line break and some bold text.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And let's see what happens now.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Oh, man! We completely broke our form.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
You know--now we're printing the bold text, "oh no!"

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and we add a line break and this allows a user

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to completely manipulate what our document looks like.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So that is not something we want to allow.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.553
Let's talk about how to fix this.
