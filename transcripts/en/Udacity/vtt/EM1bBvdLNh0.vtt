00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.090
An IDS can be deployed at
the perimeter of a network, or

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.640
subnet, to monitor traffic going in and
out of the network.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.550
Such an IDS is a network IDS.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.540
It typically uses
a packet capturing tool,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.740
such as the libpcap tool to
obtain network traffic data.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.810
The packet data contains the complete
information about network connections.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.050
For example, if a user connects to
a website using his browser, the packet

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.640
data will contain all the TCP handshake
information between the browser and

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.250
the web server, and all the URL
requests from the browser and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.240
the return page contents
from the server.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.390
That is, by examining the packet data,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.580
the IDS has all the data sent and
received by the user's browser.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.480
If the user's machine is infected by
a bot malware, for example, any attempts

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.720
to connect to a website for command and
control, the network IDS will be able

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.790
to see that the traffic looks like
CNC activities and output an alert.
