00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.296
At the end of the last lesson and now with Grant's latest issue as well, we've

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:08.974
seen that sometimes parabolas don't have two real roots. Remember that a root is

00:00:08.974 --> 00:00:13.646
a value for x that satisfies a quadratic equation. Now, there's a single part of

00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:18.119
the quadratic formula that we can look at to determine how many real roots of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.414
parabola will have. That expression is called the discriminate. Just to remind

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:26.630
you, here's the general form for a quadratic equation, and the quadratic formula

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.341
for calculating the roots of that equation. Knowing that the discriminate on

00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:36.633
it's own is what determines the number of real roots, which of the following

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:42.776
expressions down here do you think is a discriminate? Is it negative b, negative

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:49.304
b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac, b squared negative 4ac,

00:00:49.304 --> 00:00:51.647
b squared minus 4ac, or 2a?
