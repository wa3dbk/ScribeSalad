I think it'd be a good idea to practice with this algorithm a little bit to get better into your head.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's say that we're going to try to find the shortest path from A to F in this graph

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and we're going to use the algorithm that we were kind of sketching out together on the previous line.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
As you recall, what is does is it does a kind of breadth-first search from A

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but instead of expanding nodes at the bottom of the tree it always

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
expands the node that has the smallest number written in the node.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The very first time that E appears when we're building that tree,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
what number goes into the circle associated with E as we build up this tree anywhere inside.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Simulate the algorithm, figure out what goes in the E, and then write the answer in the box.
