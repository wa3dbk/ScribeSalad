00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So the question is, what's the purpose of the minimum viable product?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It turns out that the answer is pretty specific.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
You want to test the ability of some portion of your product and meet minimal customer needs

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and that might change over time but as the MVP slowly grows

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
as your confidence in what the customer archetype is.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's not how to get as much as revenue as you can as early as you can.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You might decide that's a strategy but that's kind of a counter in learning from an MVP.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You typically only make this choice when you actually feel pretty certain

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that you understand product market fit.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And while we certainly want to identify bugs in a product

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
hopefully if we've been using an agile methodology,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we kind of squash most of them before they've gone out the door.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Explicitly the goal of an MVP is not an engineering alpha or beta test.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The goal was not to use this process to find all the bugs though they might come up.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The goal of an MVP is to actually test the ability of the product

00:00:58.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to meet minimal customer needs as in choice one.
