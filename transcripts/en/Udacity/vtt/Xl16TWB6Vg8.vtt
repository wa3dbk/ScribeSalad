00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:07.100
lot of people think of when they think of a psychologist, a therapist sitting

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:13.260
on a couch talking to someone. Psychotherapy uses psychological techniques to

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.132
modify behavior and thought patterns, or both. And it also helps a patient

00:00:18.132 --> 00:00:22.568
develop insight into their own behaviors. In this type of treatment, a

00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:26.152
therapist will work with a client, either alone or in groups, and in most, but

00:00:26.152 --> 00:00:31.606

00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:40.428
approaches include: psychoanalytic therapy, humanistic positive therapy,

00:00:40.428 --> 00:00:46.260
behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy.
