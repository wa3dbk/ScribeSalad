00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.380
Now that we've declared
z to be an optional,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.689
let's try to use z in an operation.

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:06.030
Let's take a look at this error.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.380
Here the compiler is telling us
that z needs to be unwrapped.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.345
You can't use a present
that's still wrapped.

00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:17.315
Now to unwrap z, we could just follow
the suggestion from the compiler and

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:20.945
place an exclamation
mark after z like this.

00:00:21.975 --> 00:00:26.212
But when unwrapping optionals,
we want to be as careful as possible, so

00:00:26.212 --> 00:00:29.262
we're going to learn the safest
way to unwrap a variable.

00:00:29.262 --> 00:00:33.572
Here we can see that this 123 string
will convert to an int with no problem.

00:00:33.572 --> 00:00:35.262
But what if we weren't so sure?

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:39.202
Here is a scenario in which z
might actually evaluate to nil.

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:45.420
I've created an array with two items and
an index that is randomly either 0 or 1.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.040
When I get this string from the array,

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.550
I can't be sure whether it can
be converted to an end value.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.560
I don't know whether z will be nil or
not.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.000
How do we unwrap z safely so that we
can use it in further operations?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.720
Swift uses the, if let, construction
to carefully unwrap optionals.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.460
Take the time to really
study this expression.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.550
It'll come up frequently
in your Swift projects.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.480
This is the expression
that unwraps z and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.700
places the int into
a plain old int variable.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.080
In this case, we named it int value, but
there's not a strict naming convention.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.030
This unwrapping and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.970
initializing of int value is also a
Boolean expression controlling this if.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.990
It serves two purposes, and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.210
it will only evaluate to true if
the optional has an int value.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.560
If the optional stores nil, then the
whole expression will evaluate to false.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.580
Inside the block, the variable intValue
has been initialized as an int and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.980
can safely be used.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.560
And we can use an else block for
the nil case.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.020
To see both cases,
you can rerun the Playground.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.720
Just go up to the Editor's
menu &gt; Execute Playground.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.130
You can see the results
over here on the sidebar.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.400
Just click on this little eyeball,.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.690
And I'll run it again.

00:01:59.846 --> 00:02:01.774
And again.

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:05.840
[LAUGH] Sometimes I get a value and
sometimes I don't.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.960
In this example, I chose variable
names to make the code easier to read.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.350
But a convention adopted by many
developers is to name the unwrapped

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.090
variable to match the wrapped variable,
like this.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.290
This can be a little confusing at first,
but

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.960
you'll get used to it after
you see it a few times.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.090
You don't have to adopt
to this convention, but

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.830
you may find that it saves time.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.570
This way you don't have to come up with
a new name for every unwrapped variable.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.140
Safely unwrapping optionals like this
is a fundamental Swift skill, and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.290
one can't have too much practice.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.530
Let's walk through another
example with UIImageView.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.680
Here I've created a UIImageView
which has a UIImage property.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.550
This UIImage property
is a UIImage optional.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.690
In this example, we'd like to access the
size property of this UIImage optional.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.460
If I try to access the image
property directly to get the size,

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.850
the compiler complains.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.260
Since there's no guarantee that this
image property contains a value,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.300
we'll need to unwrap it carefully.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.790
So we use if let to
declare a variable and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.620
initialize it with
the unwrapped image property.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.550
If the image has a value,
we can access its size.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.870
If the image is nil,
we're still covered.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.420
Let's say we hadn't set the image yet.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.730
In that case,
the else block gets executed.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.370
And here we can see
the image hasn't been set.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.399
And if we do go ahead and set the image
to something, here we can see its size.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.000
And now that it's unwrapped, we can also
expand the image from within Playground.
