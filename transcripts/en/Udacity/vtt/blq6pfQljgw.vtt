00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.062
Now that we've talked about how to write exponents using MathQuill, I'd also

00:00:04.074 --> 00:00:08.083
like to tell you what we do with fractions. You'll notice that if you want to

00:00:08.095 --> 00:00:12.146
type 3 over 4 and get it to look exactly like this, all you need to do is type

00:00:12.158 --> 00:00:17.029
3/4. Then, just like with exponents, if you want to continue typing something

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:21.108
after a fraction, to get out of being in the denominator of the fraction, you

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.355
just use a right arrow key. And then, you can continue typing like normal. So,

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:28.940
try out those first two with the instructions that I've given you. And then, for

00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:32.182
the last one, which is a challenge problem, you get to use your new found

00:00:32.194 --> 00:00:35.544
understanding of our wonderful MathQuill tool to write both exponents and

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:37.631
fractions. And even an exponent in a fraction.
