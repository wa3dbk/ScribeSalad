00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.625
When we rationalize this fraction, we'll get 4 root 35 plus 2 root 15. Great

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.796
effort if you found it. We start by multiplying the numerator and denominator

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:15.210
by the conjugate of this expression. The conjugate of 2 root 5 minus root 7 is

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.398
2 root 5 plus root 7. We multiply 26 to each of these terms to get 52 root 5

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:27.106
plus 26 root 7. For the denominator, we use our difference of squares to do a

00:00:27.106 --> 00:00:32.357
squared minus b squared. We can't simplify or combine terms in the numerator,

00:00:32.357 --> 00:00:36.984
since this is root 5 and this is root 7. So we just list the numerator here

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:41.561
again, and then we simplify the denominator. 2 squared is 4, and the root of 5

00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:46.244
squared is 5. We have our subtraction sign and then we have the square of root

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:50.758
7, which is just 7. We simplify our denominator to get 13, and then divide it

00:00:50.758 --> 00:00:56.579
into each of the terms. 15 divided by 13 is 4, and 26 divided by 13 is 2.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.178
Another way to think about it, is we're really factoring a 13 from the 52 root

00:01:01.178 --> 00:01:06.861
5, and the 26 root 7. If we factor our 13 out, we'll be left with 4 root 5,

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:11.289
plus 2 root 7. This allows us to simplify the factor of 13 that appears in the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:16.299
numerator, and denominator. This simplifies to 1. So we're left with this for a

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.787
fraction, and anything divided by 1, is simply itself. So we can write our

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:22.627
answer like this.
