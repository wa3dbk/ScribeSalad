00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You've now seen a bunch of these token definitions,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
one for words, one for strings.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A lexical analyzer or lexer--this is a term of art--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is just a collection of such tokens.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You tell me what makes a word, what makes a string,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
what makes a number, what makes white space.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You put it all together, and the result is a lexer,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
something that splits a string into exactly

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the token definitions you've given it.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For example, once I put these 3 rules together,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
they become a lexer, or lexical analyzer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And in fact, suppose we passed to this lexical analyzer

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the input string 33 is less than 55.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Oh, gentle student, tell to me which one of these

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
token output sequences could result.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In this multiple choice quiz,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
indicate which of these 3 possible output lists

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
could correspond to the values of the tokens

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
extracted from this input string using these rules.

00:01:08.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let's put it all together.
