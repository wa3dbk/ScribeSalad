00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.130
Now it's time for you to add the functionality

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.850
to save entities to your app. Let's see how you

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.119
can achieve that. Okay. So here I'm looking at the

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:13.350
saveProfile method in the ConferenceAPI class. If you recall, we

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.000
already have the code to create a new profile.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.150
We just call new on the profile, and pass in

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.310
the arguments that we need. Creating a new profile entity

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.390
is as simple as calling new on the profile class.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.770
If we weren't using objectify, the code would be

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.500
more complicated. You already have the code to create a

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.650
new profile object, but you don't need to make

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.580
any changes now that the profile has been identified as

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:42.100
an entity. However, creating an entity doesn't automatically save

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.890
it in the data store. You have to explicitly save

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.670
it if you want it saved. Okay, I'm going to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.570
go ahead and add the code to save the profile

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.760
entity in the data store. You're going to be writing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.830
this code yourself in your own app in just

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.910
a minute. Now, I'll run the app again on

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.400
local host, and go to the APIs Explorer. So

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.180
here I am in the APIs Explorer and I'm

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.240
going to go into the Save Profile method again.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.570
And, execute it. And have Lemon Cake as my

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.900
display name. Set my TeeShirtSize to M, and execute it.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.340
Oops, I forgot to authorize. Let's try that again because that's not authorized.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.310
Authorize. Now I can execute the function again, I

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.650
don't need to enter the values, just press Execute.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.150
And there it goes. It's creating my profile. And

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.600
you see here, the request set the display name

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.060
to Lemon Cake, T shirt size to medium to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.200
M. Response returned profile with these fields. So the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.040
response shows that the profile was created. But this

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.270
time, hopefully it was more than created, it was actually

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.000
saved in the data store. And we can use the data store admin to check that. So

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.360
now I'm going to go to the admin console on local host. To get to the admin

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.675
console, you go to the port where your app is running, which is for me that's

00:02:04.675 --> 00:02:09.297
localhost:8080. And then it's

00:02:09.297 --> 00:02:16.330
/_ah/admin and this takes us to the Datastore view. The

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.060
Datastore admin for local host opens. You can see here

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.350
that it doesn't know what my app ID is. Says your

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.450
app ID, and that's okay, because local host doesn't care what

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.950
the app ID is. Course when I when actually want to

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.430
deploy to appspot I will need to provide a real app

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.980
ID. The admin console opens by default showing the Datastore Viewer.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.840
But if you're somewhere else and you want to get back

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.550
to the Datastore Viewer, or for some reason it doesn't open

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.460
there by default, you just click this Datastore Viewer and there you are in the

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.030
Datastore Viewer. This entity kind menu shows the

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.710
different kinds of entities that are stored in

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.830
your Datastore. Right now, the only one

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.250
we've got is Profile. You'll click List Entities,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.270
to seal the entities of that kind that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.650
have already been saved. There'll probably be only

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.790
one entity now, which is the profile that

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.630
we just saved. So the data store viewer shows

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.670
you the entities, it shows you the properties. We've

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.050
got displayName, mainEmail, teeShirtSize. Okay, so that was just

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.570
a quick review of how to save the entity in the data store, and how to go to

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.430
the admin console on local host to look at

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.870
your entities. You're going to be doing that now.
