00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.442
Here, the equation we can write is 200 divided by x minus 10 equals 240 divided

00:00:05.442 --> 00:00:12.853
by x. Great thinking if you found this equation. The key is that the bus can

00:00:12.853 --> 00:00:18.950
travel 200 miles in the same amount of time that the van can travel 240 miles.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.476
So, this time, for the bus to travel 200 miles has to be equal to this time for

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:26.890
the van to travel 240 miles.
