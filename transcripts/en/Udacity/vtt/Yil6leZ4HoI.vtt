00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.980
As we saw in the previous code

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:05.130
example, properties can have different types. These are

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.860
called property types. For the recipe kind, some

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.495
of the property names and types were name,

00:00:11.495 --> 00:00:15.841
which was a string. Vegetarian, a boolean indicator.

00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:19.490
And the number of servings, an integer. But

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.135
these are just a few property types. In

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.530
fact, Datastore supports a lot more property types.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.113
And we mean, a lot. The

00:00:28.113 --> 00:00:31.403
official documentation on developers.google.com lists around

00:00:31.403 --> 00:00:34.870
20 of them. In this class, we're only going to use a small

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.440
subset of these. And the ones you can see listed here are some

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.245
of the most common properties. Integers.

00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:46.080
Floating-point numbers. Strings. Dates and binary data.
