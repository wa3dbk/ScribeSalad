00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.610
Now that we have a deeper understanding
of the relationship between maximum

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.050
matching and max flow problems,

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.260
we're ready to understand
a more sophisticated algorithm.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.810
Back in the maximum flow lecture,

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.990
we considered two ways to improve
over the naive Ford-Fulkerson.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.720
One was to prefer heavier
augmenting paths.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.229
Ones that pushed more flow
from the source to the sync.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.330
In the max matching context,
this doesn't make much sense,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.860
because all augmenting
pats have the same effect.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.180
They increase the matching by one.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.810
The other idea was to prefer the
shortest augmenting path, and there was

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.200
Dinic's further insight that the breadth
first search need only be done when

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.770
the shortest path length changes,
not once for every augmentation.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.640
Pursuing these ideas gives us
the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm.
