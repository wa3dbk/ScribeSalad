00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.209
There are a few ways to solve this one. Here's the approach I took. I knew that

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:08.135
the cylinders were all the same length, so I created just one. I then, reused

00:00:08.135 --> 00:00:12.770
this cylinder's geometry to make each cylinder object. To get the four rotation

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.228
axes, I realized these formed an x shape. If I could enumerate all four

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:21.070
directions in my loop, I'd be done. So, that's what this tricksy code does here.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.766
It gives me negative x, negative z on the first iteration, negative x, z on the

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:31.628
next, and so on. I then normalize this x and then use it as usual. You could

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:36.243
also solve this one by using just two rotation axes and flipping the sign of the

00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:40.090
theta, rotating each pair of cylinders in opposite directions.
