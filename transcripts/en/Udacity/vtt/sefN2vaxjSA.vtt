00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.920
To create this scatter plot, we're going to use our ggplot function.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.540
And we're going to pass it the Mitchell data frame. We'll pass our

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.910
month variable to x and our temperature variable to y and we'll

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.260
wrap that in the AES wrapper. And the last thing I'll do is

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.730
add geom_point so that way we create a scatter plot. And

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.190
there it is. If you use a q plot syntax, it would have

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.890
been a little bit shorter. And we still get the same plot.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.380
Again, q plot is pretty smart here since it automatically knows that x

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.220
is the month variable and y is the temperature

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.300
variable. These variables are passed in alphabetically to the parameters

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.860
X, and then Y. Because both X and Y

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.255
are used, plot is to make a scatter plot.
