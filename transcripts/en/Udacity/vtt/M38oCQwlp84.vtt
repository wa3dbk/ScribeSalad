Leading up the, the last quiz, we already had a lot of information about our

00:00:03.828 --> 00:00:07.881
situation. And we'd also picked out what really mattered to us. In terms of how

00:00:07.893 --> 00:00:11.797
we need to go about finding the cost to make one wiper set. In the last quiz, we

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.725
added one more piece of information to this list. And I'm going to write that

00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:19.971
out a little bit more formally now. We decided that we would represent this

00:00:19.983 --> 00:00:24.352
quantity right here, the cost to make one wiper set, by a variable. I'm going to

00:00:24.364 --> 00:00:28.460
pick the letter c for that variable. C is going to equal the cost to make 1

00:00:28.472 --> 00:00:32.741
wiper set. To move one step closer to having a formal mathematical equation to

00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:36.845
describe our situation, I'd like to help us get some other numbers in our

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:41.466
equation. Looking at this given information up here, can you tell me two numbers

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:45.797
that equal, respectively, the cost to make 92 wiper sets, and the number of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.755
wiper sets that are made. This is going to help us with substitution, in the

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:50.421
next step of the process.
