00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.548
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So you're working on Auto Cad now. So what is Auto Cad exactly, is it a

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:06.606
platform, is it a program, what is that?

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:10.989
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; If you're a artist, it's sort of viewed as both. It's a product by itself, but

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:15.912
it's also, other products are built, on top of it. There's a map product for

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:21.960
GIS data, there's architectural products and mechanical engineering products.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.377
But when I'm working with it I actually view it as a standalone product, by

00:00:26.377 --> 00:00:30.902
itself. And it's just a tool that allows designers to really turn their

00:00:30.902 --> 00:00:33.473
internal designs into reality.
