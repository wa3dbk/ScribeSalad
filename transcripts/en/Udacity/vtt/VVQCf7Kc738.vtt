This last function that we looked at is a bit of an interesting kind of

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.665
piecewise function, it's called a step function. A step function, is a function

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:11.075
that's made up of one or more constant functions, as you can see for the last

00:00:11.075 --> 00:00:16.469
one we worked with. In both the graph and the equation, each piece is in fact a

00:00:16.469 --> 00:00:21.780
constant function. f of x is equal to just a number in each part of the domain.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.711
And we have a bunch of straight horizontal lines. In light of what you've just

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.195
learned about step functions, which of these graphs do you think represent step

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:34.091
functions? Remember that a step function is just a function made up of one or

00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:36.329
more constant pieces.
