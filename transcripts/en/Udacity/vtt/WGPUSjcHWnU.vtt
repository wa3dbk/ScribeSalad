00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.812
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Manipulating this in the ways that we've practiced gives us m is greater than

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:09.184
or equal to 333 and 1 3rd. Let's look at this on a number line. So, m can be

00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:13.910
anything to the right of, or including, 333 and a third. But wait, what are we

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.524
talking about anyway? What was m equal to? M is equal to the number of deluxe

00:00:18.524 --> 00:00:23.074
wipers sold. Now, you can't sell a third of a wiper set, so that means we're

00:00:23.074 --> 00:00:27.462
going to have to make m into a whole number. Now, if we make it 333, then we

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:31.921
won't quite make it to our $20,000 profit level. So, that mean that we're going

00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:36.428
to have to round up. M has to be greater than or equal to 334 wipers. Well, I'm

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:40.780
going to leave our number line looking just like this, because these would be

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.935
about in the same place. You can just imagine that our bracket has shifted

00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:50.083
slightly to the right. What we want is the minimum possible value for m, so the

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:55.811
smallest value in this range of possible solutions. That, of course, is going to

00:00:55.811 --> 00:01:00.680
be just this endpoint solution, 334 exactly. So we want m equals 334.
