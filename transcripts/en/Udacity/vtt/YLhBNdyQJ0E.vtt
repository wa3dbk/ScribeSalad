00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Noam Chomsky is a philosopher and a linguist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and in his seminal 1955 work "Syntactic Structures,"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
he suggests that utterances have rules, syntactic rules,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and they're governed by formal grammars.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The problem with the wrote, wrote, wrote, de, de, de bag of words above

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is that they don't form a grammatical sentence.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We much prefer grammatical sentences.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It's easier to interpret them and figure out what they mean.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We can write down these formal grammars

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
using a special notation.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Here these 5 lines together

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
are my formal grammar, and each one

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is what is known as a rewrite rule.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The words that I've written in blue are called non-terminals.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If you have one of these things written in blue,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
you can rewrite it with whatever is to the right of the arrow.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
These words that I've written in black never occur on the left

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of any one of our rewrite rules, so they can never be replaced.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Once you get there, you're stuck, and the process terminates.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We call them terminals.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Using these rules, if I start with sentence,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I can rewrite sentence to be subject verb,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and then I could rewrite that by picking any one of the rules

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that has subject on the left.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let's pick students.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I've only replaced subject, leaving this verb non-terminal alone.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But then I could replace verb with any one of these rules,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and at this point I think we're done.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The process terminates because I can't replace students or think

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
with anything, so here I've used 1, 2, 3, rewrite rules

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
to start from sentence and end up with a valid utterance.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This sort of maneuver with all these arrows is sometimes called

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a derivation because I was able to derive

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
"students think" starting from sentence using these rewrite rules.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Even using this relatively simple grammar, however,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I have a few options.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Here I've shown another derivation starting with sentence.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Sentence goes to subject verb, verb goes to write,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
subject goes to teachers, and I've produced another string

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
in the language of the grammar.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Both "students think" and also "teachers write"

00:02:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
can be produced by that grammar.
