&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Maybe we'll get some ideas about what to do about these points if we graph

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:07.603
them. That might help us move a little bit closer to an equation. So which of

00:00:07.603 --> 00:00:11.891
these graphs on the coordinate plane right here matches the coordinates in the x

00:00:11.891 --> 00:00:15.769
y table over here? Please select the letter next to the graph that you think

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.300
contains all of these points.
