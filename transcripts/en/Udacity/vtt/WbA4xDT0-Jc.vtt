00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.666
I think it's time to switch things up a bit and see some numbers that can't be

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:08.590
written as rational powers of the base. We're also going to pick a new base to

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.664
work with, log base 10, which is one of the most convenient bases to use

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:16.988
because there's a button on calculators for it. In fact, I'd like you to use

00:00:16.988 --> 00:00:20.831
your calculator to do these problems. You'll probably be able to figure out a

00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:23.454
few of them on your own without the calculator, but it makes sense to use it

00:00:23.454 --> 00:00:27.987
just to make sure that the buttons work the way you think they do. In fact, on

00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:32.271
many calculators and sometimes in textbooks and other places, instead of seeing

00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:37.379
log base 10. You'll just see the word log without a base written, this usually

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.430
means log base 10. In fact, let's look and see what my calculator has on it.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.827
Sure enough, there's just a button that says log with no base. This is log base

00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:50.983
10. So let's say I want to find log base 10 of some number. Well, 11 is my

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:55.442
favorite number as you know, so let's try that. You can see I press log, and

00:00:55.442 --> 00:00:59.788
then enter the number that I'm looking for. Close the parentheses for good

00:00:59.788 --> 00:01:04.065
measure and press equals and there we go, a long decimal. I'm going to try

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:11.254
another just to humor myself. How about log base 10 of 2,314? Why not? There we

00:01:11.254 --> 00:01:15.804
go. So here are a bunch of log base 10 problems for you to figure out. I'll

00:01:15.804 --> 00:01:18.656
demo one on the calculator just to make sure that it's working like we think

00:01:18.656 --> 00:01:23.524
it's going to. To find log base 10 of 1 if I didn't want to use the calculator,

00:01:23.524 --> 00:01:29.212
I'd rewrite 1 as 10 to the 0. So that means this should give us 0. Let's make

00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:33.276
sure our calculator's working the way we think it is. So to find log base 10 of

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:39.250
1, I press log and then 1. Close the parentheses and sure enough we got 0.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.764
Great. Now you get plenty of chances to try this out on your own.
