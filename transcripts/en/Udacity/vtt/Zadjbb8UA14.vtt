00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
[Peter] So given the speed of light in meters per second

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and a variable, nano_per_second,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
representing the number of nanoseconds in a single second,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
let's create our nanodistance.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
To initialize a variable, you simply write out the name.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And in order to get the nanodistance,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we're going to divide the speed of light by nano per second.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
To check our code, let's print it out.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And when we run it, we get 0.2998.
