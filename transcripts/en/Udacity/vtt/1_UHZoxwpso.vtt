As a new developer, you might be tempted to memorize a

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.570
certain click path in order to get some kind of process

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.420
done, but it's not always a good idea. Instead, it's better

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.590
to find the general area of where you want to get something

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.460
done, go there, and then figure it out. Let me explain

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.920
what I mean. The setup page is an important place to

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.500
go. It's where you go when you want to customize your app.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.490
This Schema builder let's you visualize the objects and relationships and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.560
add fields to them. It's a good place to go

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.530
to get the big picture view of what you're building. When

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.680
you click on an object, you get to the object

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.620
homepage, which is a good place to look at specific records.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.030
When you click on a record, you get to the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.950
record detail page. Which gives you specific information about that record.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.380
The Quick Access menu gives you handy shortcuts to customizing

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.610
your application. And finally, there's the page layout editor which helps

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270
you select the fields and display them in the order that you want them.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.720
They'll run pretty quickly and you're not

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.270
going to remember everything I said. Sales Force

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.820
has a lot of ways to do something and if you click around, you're going to

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.570
find it. If you don't, try clicking the help link or use the discussion forums
