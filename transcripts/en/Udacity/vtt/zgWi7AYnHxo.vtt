00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.019
So far, we have seen how to add and
subtract vectors, and

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.930
we have seen how to multiply
vectors by scalars.

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.560
This might lead you to ask,
can we multiply two vectors?

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.250
It turns out that there are several
different notions of vector

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.550
multiplication.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.520
Perhaps the first one we might think of,
just multiplying corresponding

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.690
coordinates, doesn't turn out to
be useful in many applications.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.060
However, there are other notions of
multiplication, which are very useful.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.870
One of the most important operations
we can perform on vectors is

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.920
the inner product, also called the dot
product, since we often represent

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.400
it by placing a dot between
the vectors being multiplied.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.850
It's important stems from its
geometric interpretation.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.750
It let's us find the angle
between two different vectors.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.230
More precisely,
the inner product of the vectors, v and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.018
w, in Euclidean space,
satisfies the following identity,

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:59.090
v dot w equals the magnitude
of v times the magnitude of w,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.990
times the cosine of theta, where theta
is the angle between the vectors, v and

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.610
w, if we were to draw them
emanating from the same point.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.230
Technically, there are two angles
between the vectors, a shorter one and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.520
a longer one.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.550
We always use the shorter
one by convention.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.410
Note that the inner product of two
vectors is a number, not a vector.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.790
Using the inverse of
the cosine function,

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.260
also called the arc cosine function,
we can solve for this angle.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.854
It equals the arc cosine of
the dot product of v and w,

00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:37.357
divided by the product of
the magnitudes of v and w.

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:40.987
Another way we can think of this
formula is as the following.

00:01:40.987 --> 00:01:48.198
The arc cosine of the normalization of
v dotted with the normalization of w.

00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:52.055
Of course, unless we have a nicer way
of computing the dot product of two

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.771
vectors, this formula
doesn't do us much good.

00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:58.523
It turns out that there is a nicer
way to compute the inner product,

00:01:58.523 --> 00:02:03.090
and it is similar to our first candidate
notion for multiplying vectors.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.720
To compute v dot w, we can multiply
the corresponding components of v and

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.520
w, and
then we can add those products together.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.830
So, for example,
the dot product of the vectors 1,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.790
2, -1 and 3, 1, 0 is 1 times 3,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.780
plus 2 times 1, plus -1 times 0,
which equals 5.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.010
This means that the angle between these
two vectors is the dot product of v and

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.970
w, which is 5,
divided by the magnitude of v, which is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.250
the square root of 6, and the magnitude
of w, which is the square root of 10.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.270
This gives about 0.87 radians,
which is about 50 degrees.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.750
There are some interesting consequences
of this connection between the inner

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.590
product of two vectors and their angle.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.412
First, recall that the cosine
of x is always bounded

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:05.022
below by -1 and above by 1,
no matter what x is.

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:09.090
Using the earlier equation,
that the dot product of v and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.158
w is the product of the magnitudes
times cosine of theta,

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:18.074
we see that the dot product is bounded
below by negative magnitude of v

00:03:18.074 --> 00:03:23.930
times magnitude of w, and above by
magnitude of v times magnitude of w.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.960
We can express this inequality more
succinctly as the absolute value of v

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.790
dot w is less than or equal to the
product of the magnitudes of v and w.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.180
This is a famous inequality called
the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.120
and you will see this inequality
pop up all over linear algebra and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.900
mathematics, in general.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.740
Let's assume, for the moment,
that neither v nor w is the zero vector,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.910
which would mean that their dot
product is automatically zero.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.660
What does it mean if v dot w
actually equals the magnitude of v

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.720
times the magnitude of w?

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.680
From our earlier equation, it means
that the cosine of theta equals 1,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.030
and this tells us that theta must equal
0 in both degrees and in radians.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.395
In other words, the vectors, v and w,
are pointing in the same direction.

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:18.930
Similarly, if v dot w equals
the negative of the product

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.620
of the magnitudes, we can conclude
that cosine of theta equals -1,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.820
which means that theta equals
pi radians, or 180 degrees.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.710
And that, in turn, means that v and
w are pointing in opposite directions.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.840
Finally, if v dot w equals 0, then,
since we assumed that neither v nor

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.460
w was the zero vector, this means
that cosine of theta must equal 0.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.520
This means that theta equals pi
over 2 radians, or 90 degrees.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.380
So, v and
w are at a right angle to each other.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.290
One last thing to consider is what
happens when you take the dot product

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.300
of a vector with itself.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.430
In this case, the angle between
the two vectors is 0, both radians and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.170
degrees, so,
cosine of theta will equal 1.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:15.860
So our formula reduces to v dot v
equals the magnitude of v squared.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.800
After a little rearrangement,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.130
we can see that the magnitude of v
equals the square root of v dot v.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.550
This gives us another interpretation
of the magnitude of a vector,

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.650
this time in terms of its dot product.
