00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:03.932
Okay. So, let's look at these scenarios and figure out what the right choice would be.

00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:08.261
So for the first, we're looking at a small input vector, and you've got plenty of processors.

00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:10.468
So, you're not really worried so much about work efficiency.

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.293
You have more than enough processors to do the work that you need to do.

00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:15.917
Thus, you're probably going to be concerned with the

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:17.847
step efficiency of the algorithm that you pick.

00:00:17.847 --> 00:00:21.025
And the one with the greatest step efficiency is Hillis and Steele.

00:00:21.025 --> 00:00:24.043
Now conversely, when you have an enormous amount of work to do,

00:00:24.043 --> 00:00:27.432
and not nearly enough processors to do it, you're going to be looking for the

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:29.883
algorithm that is going to have the best work complexity.

00:00:29.883 --> 00:00:33.815
And so, for this, if you have parallel processors, you're absolutely going to want to run the

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:35.868
work-efficient algorithm, Blelloch's algorithm.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:40.679
Now, if you only have 1 processor to work with, you're stuck with a serial algorithm no matter what.
