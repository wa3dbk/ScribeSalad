00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.280
By adding the meta viewport
tag to the head element of

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.540
the page we tell the browser
that we know what we're doing.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.640
We need to use the meta viewport
value with =device-width, which

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.820
instructs the page to match the screen's
width in device independent pixels.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.240
This allows the page to reflow
content to match the screen sizes,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.120
whether rendered on a small
mobile device or on the laptop.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.695
Adding the attribute initial-scale=1
instructs the browsers to establish

00:00:32.695 --> 00:00:40.110
a one to one relationship between device
independent pixels and CSS pixels.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.830
CSS pixels are what we're used to
working with most of the time, and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.772
really the only one I
need to worry about.

00:00:47.772 --> 00:00:52.400
Without initial-scale=1 some
browsers will keep the page width

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.260
constant when rotating
to landscape mode.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.759
They also scale the content rather
than allowing it to reflow.
