The main thing I would say is for ethical reasons. Now, it's not fair to leave

Greg with his fear of bells. What if he's waiting in line at a deli and someone

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.936
hits a bell, then he jumps and he drops all his food because he's scared he's

00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:14.625
going to hit with a toy gun. It might be kind of embarrassing for him, however,

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.775
one important reason why we would want to extinguish this fear is because of

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:22.043
something called generalization. I'm going to talk to you guys about

00:00:22.043 --> 00:00:25.862
generalization using the classical conditioning example of the little Albert

00:00:25.862 --> 00:00:27.211
study.
