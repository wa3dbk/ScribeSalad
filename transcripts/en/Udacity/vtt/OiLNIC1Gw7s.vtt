00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.690
So, you have the heart framework to
think about categories and metrics.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.600
Now, which metrics should you actually
track to make data informed decisions?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.852
Well, that will depend on your product.

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:13.370
You want to create
a small set of metrics or

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.250
key performance indicators that
everyone on your team cares about.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.000
To do that,
here's a process that can help you.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.610
First, you should think about
the top-level goals for

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.380
the product or feature.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.760
This is a good time to check in
with stakeholders, investors, and

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.300
anyone else on the team.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.940
The discussion allows you to
collect different ideas for

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.800
the goals and build consensus about
which goals are most important.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.850
Now, a common mistake is to define
the goals in terms of the metric.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.040
For example, you might say that your
goal is to increase the number of people

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.340
who make a purchase, which is common for
many e-commerce websites.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.380
Instead, you should think about
the user experience improvements

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.110
that could help drive that change.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.040
So be sure to narrow in on
your definition of the goal.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.360
Next, you want to pair low level
signals to each of the goals.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.730
For example, at Udacity,
an engagement signal might be,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.370
how many minutes of video a user
watches with each session.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.040
You might also look at failure signals,
such as failed searches when a user

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.440
searches for something, but
doesn't click on any results.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.220
Once you have a couple signals down, you
should ask some additional questions to

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.690
determine which signals might be best.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.920
First, you should ask how easy or
difficult is it to track this signal?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.840
You might be able to come
up with a better proxy or

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.410
a different signal to
track that same thing.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.800
It may be that the website or

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.500
app is not instrumented to log
relevant events and actions.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730
So, you might need to do some
additional research at this point.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.350
Another question you should ask is,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.760
is the signal sensitive to changes in
the design of the website or the app?

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.440
After you've thought
about your goals and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.170
your signals, it's time to
craft your specific metrics.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.320
The metrics you choose should
be prioritized based on the main

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.080
goals of the product
that you defined first.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.880
You can always come back to refine
the metrics based on what you need do or

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.240
from what you learned.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.340
You also want to be careful
about adding too many metrics.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.120
Often times, your metrics will
be associative with one another.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.310
And you want the ones that tell
you about user behavior and

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.580
about your product.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.190
You want the metrics that
inform you of what to do next.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.760
Download the template in the
downloadables and write your own goals,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.335
signals, and metrics for some of
the categories in the HEART Framework.

00:02:21.335 --> 00:02:23.815
You don't need to have a goal for
every category.

00:02:23.815 --> 00:02:24.785
Just think about two or

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:28.335
three goals that you think are most
important to measure for your product.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.235
