00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.770
Welcome back to Computer Vision.

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.070
Megan's laughing already,
because you could tell it's Friday.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.029
Today, we're going to start on just
a couple of lectures that are,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.010
could be labeled other
stuff you should know.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.230
It's just things that come along in
Computer Vision that are, are relevant.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.260
Some of them are very old,
some of them are new.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.320
Some of them seem trivial so
we don't even teach about them normally.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.910
And yet if you don't know about them,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.100
you're totally mystified when
somebody talks to you about them.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.260
And what we're going to talk about
today is a little bit about color.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.940
Now, I had to wrestle a little bit with
exactly how to do this because my own

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.480
background color really came
through psychophysics psychologies.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.040
My, my degree was in brain and
cognitive sciences.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.260
So and I think of color as a
psychophysical or perceptual phenomena.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.680
That is when you see this thing and
you say, oh, that's a light blue shirt.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.730
That's actually not a physics statement,
it's a psychophysics statement.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.550
So I'm actually going to start there.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.860
We're going to talk about just a little
bit about, actually an, anatomy.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.810
And then we'll move on to a little
bit of computational elements having

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.269
to do with color.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.580
So and also in a few more lessons,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.423
you're going to see some, just a few
of these slides and discussions again,

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:14.690
because we're going to talk
about the humans vision system.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:17.080
But I need to just talk about
a little bit of it now, and

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.920
in particular,
I have to talk about your retina.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.790
Well, and my retina,
and everybody's retina.
