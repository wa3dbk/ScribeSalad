00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.110
So far, we have designed an abstract coffee maker with three classes and

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.730
a set of behaviors. By abstract I mean we, we haven't done anything specific to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.970
the Mark IV. This design is of value by itself. That is,

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.309
it could be used in a variety of different models. And so

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.990
we want to somehow, be able to capture that and reuse it later.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.890
Hence we should not add specifics to it, instead we should sub class it for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.590
each specific coffee maker. By sub class I mean have a sub class for

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.630
each of the classes that is part of the overall system.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.000
In particular, the dependency inversion principle says that high level modules,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.330
like the ones that we have just designed, should not depend on low level ones.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.120
Like those wrapping the API.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.800
Note that this is the opposite philosophy from layered architectures,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.420
where high level model, modules are built on top of low-level ones.
