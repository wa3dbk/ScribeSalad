00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.090
Why is this hard?

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.840
Well because unlike some early
computer vision data sets

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.140
we don't typically take an object
put it on a piece of black felt, or

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.590
velvet on top of a table and
say okay, that is a fire truck toy.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.200
Right?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.230
Pictures show up more like this,
and I think this also comes from

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.090
Kristen cause she has a thing for pandas
and I think also for koalas, all right.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.780
You get great variations in how things
are illuminated, the pose of objects.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.940
The objects are sort of seen in
the background with a bunch of clutter,

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.290
they get occluded so here, you know,
there's trees in the way, you know,

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.790
the viewpoint, and then, oh, isn't
this a really cute face of a koala.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.030
Yeah, but you know what to another koala
he may not really like this guy because

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.586
he, like, ran off with his poker chips,
or something, I don't know.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:43.350
The idea is that you know, they,
they look different one to another so

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.770
the idea that we have these
variations in appearance.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.000
The other thing is that these objects
don't show up again in isolation.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.330
They show up in these cluttered
overlapping environments.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.030
You know, here's this picture of these
two motorcycles one behind the other,

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.660
people, of course, walking pedestrians.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.510
We don't get to look at objects
in isolation typically.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.420
Another thing that makes this hard
is the importance of context.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.720
And let me show you three pictures,
okay?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.750
So you take a look at these pictures and

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.980
you probably see a person here
talking on his cellphone.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.080
You probably see here an outdoor
scene here with a building and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.300
like some people standing et cetera,
whatever.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.360
You probably see some guy, I don't know
exactly what he's doing, bending down,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.970
maybe picking something up and
here's his shoe over there.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.448
Right?
Right.

00:01:28.448 --> 00:01:32.750
Well, hm, you see these regions so
that the phone,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.460
the person, the shoe,
see this single picture here?

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.790
Let me blow up that picture
a little bit more, okay?

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.760
This patch of intensities is the same
patch here, as here, as here, as there.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.690
So what's a cellphone in one image,
is a shoe in another image.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.560
And that can only be done by
the contexts of everything else

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.500
that's around it.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.600
This also makes recognition difficult.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.680
Another challenge is the complexity.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.770
That is, we need to able to compute
things and do it relatively quickly,

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.200
because you know, there are thousands
now, now millions of pixels in an image.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.210
We've got, I don't know, 3 to 30, some
tens of thousands of object categories.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.230
We have all sorts of
degrees of freedom of pose.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.730
Yeah, that was cute, I know, right?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.930
So even though it's just a person,
a person can move in many shapes,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.720
although I can move in many fewer
shapes than I used to be able to move.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.510
And there's so many pictures, right?

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.710
There are billions of images
indexed by Google Search.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.850
The last number I could
find was that in 2011,

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.679
six billion photos were being
uploaded to various things per month.

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:41.570
Okay?

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.690
There was a billion camera
phones sold last year.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.510
Okay?
So they all take pictures.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.470
And another interesting indication of
the complexity of recognition, and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.650
of vision in general,
is how much of your brain and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.150
my brain too by the way,
is devoted to visual processing.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.440
There are different estimates,

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.350
anywhere from a, a quarter of your
entire cerebral cortex to a half.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.440
And it's the cerebral cortex
that sort of distinguishes you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.420
from an awful lot of other mammals.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.740
So the recognition, the ability for you
to manipulate things so well visually,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.630
seems to be two things, very intense.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.680
It takes a lot of wetware in order for
you to do it.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.400
But I guess evolutionarily it
must have been very useful.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.980
Because you devoted an awful
lot of wetware to handling this
