00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now I run it again. This is the path I get.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
These are the actions in the path. Let's see if it makes sense.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now 1 and 2, the two fastest people, go over first,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
1, the fastest person, comes back by themselves, 1 brings 5 over again,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
1 returns, and finally 1 takes 10 over, and we're done.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That looks like a pretty good solution.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It came up with a total time of 19.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The question is is the program correct now?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yes, it is.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
No, this example is wrong--there might be a faster example than this and it didn't find it?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Or, no, this example is okay. It is the fastest, but the other examples are wrong.

00:00:44.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Or you still can't tell.
