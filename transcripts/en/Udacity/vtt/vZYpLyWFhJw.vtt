00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.150
Let's consider one of these points of intersection, the one between this new

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:10.375
pink line and this light blue line. If we call the point where they intersect p,

00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:15.425
then what two equations can we use the coordinates of point p to relate to one

00:00:15.437 --> 00:00:19.050
another? Please fill in those two equations down here.
