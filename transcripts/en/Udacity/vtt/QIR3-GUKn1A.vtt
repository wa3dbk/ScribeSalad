00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.300
Here's our basic programmable pipeline, with a vertex shader and a fragment

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.978
shader. Once upon a time both these stages were not programmable. They were

00:00:07.978 --> 00:00:12.219
handled by what was called the Fixed Function Pipeline. Transistors in the GPU

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.360
were specifically dedicated to the Transform and Rasterization processes. The

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.368
programmer basically set a bunch of switches and values that controlled the

00:00:19.368 --> 00:00:24.091
flow of data. However, there's no real programmability involved. The Nintendo

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:27.868
Wii was about the last to use this type of architecture. In 2002, GPUs started

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:33.080
to appear that included vertex and fragment shaders. A shader is truly a

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.360
programmable piece of the pipeline. In other words, you actually send little,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.826
or sometimes large, shader programs to each of these units. These programs are

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:45.873
written in a C-like language, if you know what C or C++ looks like. Up to this

00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:50.947
point, we've been having Three.js do the programming for us. When we create a

00:00:50.947 --> 00:00:54.959
material, Three.js actually creates two small programs, one each for the vertex

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:59.225
and fragment shaders. When the object with that material is to be displayed,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:03.485
these shaders are loaded with their programs. The triangles are then sent down

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:05.790
the pipeline, and the programs are executed.
