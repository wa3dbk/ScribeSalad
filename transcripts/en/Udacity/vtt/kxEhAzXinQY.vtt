00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.040
At the very beginning of
this nano degree program,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.360
we had you do an exercise to see
how just broadly used machine

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.640
learning can be.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.790
We had you look up a topic that
you're interested in along with

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.250
machine learning to see if
had been applied there yet.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.100
For me, I used basketball, astronomy,
and cooking and found that

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.420
machine learning had already been
applied to all three of those domains.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.290
For the final project in
this nano degree program,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.520
you're going to revisit that idea.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.290
You're going to take on a project
that's completely your own.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.910
You're going to choose your own dataset,
your own area, your own domain and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.760
see what you can find
through machine learning.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.480
You're going to see what techniques
you should apply to that dataset.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.420
You're going to see what
models you can build for

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.580
the data available in that area.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.160
Now we've collected some data sets for
you that you can use, and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.980
you might be interested in some
of the ones that we've gathered,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.250
but there's plenty
available online as well.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.630
We've actually provided some links for

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.110
you to go look up some
of your own datasets.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.800
The idea of this last project is that
machine learning is much more than

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.200
being able to use the techniques
that you've learned.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.930
It's also knowing when to use them, and

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.700
how to evaluate the results
that come out of them.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.450
So, for this final project,
that's exactly what you're going to do.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.706
You're going to take on your
own dataset, your own question,

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.239
generate your own models, generate
your own conclusions, and report them.
