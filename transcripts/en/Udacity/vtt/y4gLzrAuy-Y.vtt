00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.090
It's time to update
your Weather App again.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.939
Here's what I want you to do.

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:07.689
Add a gulp build project to your app.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.623
If you're not familiar with gulp check
out the instructor notes below for

00:00:11.623 --> 00:00:15.305
a starter file you can use and
to get a starting guide.

00:00:15.305 --> 00:00:20.275
Then replace your existing service
worker with one created by sw precache.

00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:25.915
Be sure to use the runtime caching
option to cache the app data.

00:00:25.915 --> 00:00:27.735
When you've completed this step,

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:31.310
your app should work exactly
the same as it did before.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.600
But now you've simplified
the build process and

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.110
reduced some of the headaches of
ruling your own service worker.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.610
That means if you change
a single file on the App Shell,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.730
only that file will need to be updated.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.880
Be sure to compare your app to
the link in the instructor notes below

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.639
to make sure it works exactly the same.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.560
And if you want to learn more about
gulp, check out the tooling and

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.260
