00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.710
Now, if you really want to bug me here, you could of course now argue the following--

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.340
why not just divide all of the values--each value of each object by v.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.980
Then the total sum of objects would be 1 and the running time here would presumably be O(n).

00:00:17.980 --> 99:59:59.000
So is that a possibility?
