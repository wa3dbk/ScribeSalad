Thank you for your answer.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:06.070
As we mentioned, there isn't a right or wrong answer to this last question.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.350
So what's the solution?

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.590
We used three different classifiers because different models perform well for

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.160
different problems.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.800
So we can experiment with multiple models and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.861
then compare them using inter-model validation techniques.
