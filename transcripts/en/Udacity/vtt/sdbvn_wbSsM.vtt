00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And here is my answer. You can really read off the formula that I just gave you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If p0 we pick coin one and it comes up with heads p1 and with the 1-p0 we pick coin two

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and it comes up with heads with probablity p2.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So you can now given three arguments p0, p1, and p2 such as 0.3, 0.5, 0.9

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and it gets us 0.78 if I hit the run button.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Interestingly, if I change this numbers, for example the first one to 0.1 and the last one to 0.2.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.485
I now get a different result of 0.23.
