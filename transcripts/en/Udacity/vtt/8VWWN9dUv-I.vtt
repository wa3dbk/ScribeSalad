Although the first option of randomly assigning pregnant woman to an

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.500
experimental group. And giving them cocaine would give us excellent

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.360
experimental control. We have to remember about ethics and it would be

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.280
unethical to force woman to take cocaine. It would also be unethical to give

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.830
cocaine to babies to see what it does. That leaves us with the option of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.410
finding women. Who used cocaine while they were pregnant. Then, we can study

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.074
their babies. That would be most ethical.
