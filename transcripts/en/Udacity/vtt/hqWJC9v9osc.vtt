00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.290
We now have a button in our app.

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.150
Although, we want this button to be in the form of, an image of a microphone.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's add that image next.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.510
So I'll go back to x code and manage some real estate.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.200
I'll hide the document outline, and slide in the navigator.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.320
And hide the utility area.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.280
There, now if you look in the navigator.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.990
There is this thing called, images.xc assets.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.930
XC stands for x code.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.860
And assets means, that this thing is going to help us manage, assets or

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.210
images in our app.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.690
The first thing to notice here, is something called App Icon.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.320
This, is the icon that represents our app on the user's phone.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.190
If you look at the bottom of your screen,

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.680
you'll notice that we can add any new images or assets here.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.450
I'll click on the plus button, and then on, new image set.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.060
Let me rename this image set to, microphone.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.930
There, okay.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.932
So, here is an image of the microphone on my computer.

00:00:58.932 --> 00:01:03.430
I want to highlight that the size of this image is 100x100 pixels.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.670
By the way, this image is also available in the instructor notes for you to use.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.480
Now, you can feel free to use this image or you can customize your app,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.382
by using your own image or the image of a friend if you like.

00:01:15.382 --> 00:01:19.600
All right, I'm going to drag this image in to the one x box.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.600
There it is.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.030
Now, I'm going to start with one x, and

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.670
then I'm going to ask you to guess, what two x and three x mean.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.802
So, stay sharp and see if you can figure it out from this example.

00:01:30.802 --> 00:01:33.350
All right, so next, I'll go to my story board.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.500
And here I'll make sure that the record button is selected.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.470
And then, I will open up the utility area.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.410
And under the attributes in,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.700
inspector, I will remove the default text that I had added.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.310
And then, I will go under images and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.580
try to find the microphone image that I just added.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.560
Boom.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.740
There is my image.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.710
Now one really curious thing to notice here, is that after I've selected my

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.700
button, if I go to the size inspector, this link right here, I can check out and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.220
see the width and the height of my button, which is both hundred.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.170
So that means, that my button has conformed.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.110
To the size of the image.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.340
Okay, I'm going to go ahead and run my project, and there it is.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.990
We've added an image to our button.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.710
Now, one thing to notice here with this image,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.980
is that it looks a little bit blurrier around the edges.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.340
You may have to lean in to see this.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.990
Or I can actually go to the window menu and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.536
change the scale of the phone to 100%.

00:02:35.536 --> 00:02:39.760
There, see that the image looks somewhat blurry around the edges?

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.260
Hm.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.440
Why do you think the image is so blurry?

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.540
Care to venture a guess here?
