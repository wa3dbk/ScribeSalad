00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.886
So far as each one of these

00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:05.534
operating systems is concerned, in their native form,

00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:08.802
when they think about physical memory, they think

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:12.957
of physical memory as contiguous. But, unfortunately, the

00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:15.769
real physical memory, we're going to call it

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:18.125
machine memory from now on, is in the

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:21.870
control of the hypervisor. Not in the control

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.450
of any one operating system. So, the physical

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.420
memory of each of these operating systems is itself an

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.470
illusion. It's no longer contiguous in terms of the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.950
real machine memory that the hypervisor controls. So for instance,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.820
if you look at the physical memory that windows has, I've broken that down

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.760
into 2 regions, R1 and R2. And R1 has let's say a number

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.855
of pages 0 through Q, and R2 has a number of pages starting from Q plus 1,

00:00:56.855 --> 00:01:02.550
through N. So this is a physical memory. But if you look at this region R1, it's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.110
occupying a space in the machine memory, the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.400
real physical memory, which we call the machine memory,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.130
controlled by the hypervisor over here. R2 is not

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.630
contiguous with respect to R1 in the machine memory.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.700
It's been put over here. And come over to this guy, Lennox, and

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.740
it has its own physical memory, and we'll call that, region 1 and region 2

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.220
again. And it has a total capacity of. M +

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.210
1 physical page frames, all of which, zero through

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.580
L are contiguous in the machine memory. L+1 through M

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.770
are contiguous in machine memory, but, they're not contiguous with respect to

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.810
the other region R1. Why would this happen? The hyperwaves is not being

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.410
nasty to the operating system. After all. Even if all of the N

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.640
plus 1 pages of Windows, and N plus 1 pages

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.040
of Linux would be contiguous in the machine memory, they cannot

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.580
all start at 0 because the physical

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.580
memory, the real physical memory, which we're

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.450
calling machine memory, is the only thing that is contiguous. And that has to be

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.630
partitioned between these two guys, and therefore,

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.480
the starting point for the physical memory, the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.320
illusion of the physical memory, so far

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.250
as a particular operating system, cannot be 0.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.710
Also, the memory requirements of operating systems are

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.860
dynamic, and bursting. When Windows started out initially

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.740
with Q plus 1 pages, and later on

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.570
it needed additional memory, then it's going to request the

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.020
hypervisor and at that point, it may not

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.600
be possible for the hypervisor to give another

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.880
region, which is contiguous with the previous region

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.560
that Windows already has. So these are the reasons

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.510
why the physical memory of an operating system, it still becomes

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.480
an illusion, in terms of how it is actually contained in the machine memory.
