00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.545
So, some of these events that
we've been talking about and

00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:08.445
put in our list affect the different
concurrently executing

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.840
sub-machines that we've
already modelled.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.480
See if you can figure out which ones
of these, which ones these are and

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.210
label the transitions in the finite
state machine with their numbers.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.260
So, pick a particular event and decide

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.230
which of the state machines are affected
by that particular event happening.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.740
&gt;&gt; Starting with number one for
turning the dial for the frequency,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.400
that would be affecting our
station finance statement.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.480
&gt;&gt; So, we would now expect, as a,
in that particular machine,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.540
the station of machine that the arc
that we have, the self arc that we have

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.750
is going to be labelled by a particular
event, which is event number one, okay?

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.030
Simple, right?

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.560
And we can do the same thing for
some of these other events and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.880
come up with an annotated diagram or

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.953
a diagram in which the transitions
all have arcs on them.

00:01:07.953 --> 00:01:10.820
In our particular,
this particular exercise,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.560
we don't have any
spontaneous transitions.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.990
The spontaneous transition is
where you're in some state and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.130
you go to the next state
without any event happening.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.340
Okay, so we ultimately are going to see,
we're going to need to have for each

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.650
of the arcs that we have in the diagram,
some have been causing the transition.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.580
Remember that our arrows with two heads
on them are really an abbreviation for

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.720
two arrows, one going in each direction.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.820
&gt;&gt; So I think we meant event four for

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.500
the, event one I think's changing the
volume so that would be the volume dial

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.400
state machine but for
this one were talking about four.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.920
&gt;&gt; Okay so with the transition
were putting on the station knob,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.820
self transition is for event four.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.374
Here are the additions to our machine
to handle events one, two, three, four,

00:01:57.374 --> 00:01:58.170
12, and 13.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.167
So with respect to event one,
that's the volume knob that's similar

00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:07.960
to our station one, or
switching the band between AM and FM.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.030
Those are events two and three,
one going to the left and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.070
one going to the right.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.679
And similarly sliding the mode switch to
the right and left are events 12 and 13.
