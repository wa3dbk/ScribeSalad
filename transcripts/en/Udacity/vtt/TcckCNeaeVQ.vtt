00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, one of the wonderful things about depth-first search is that it can be implemented really

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
straightforwardly with recursion, which makes it very easy to read and

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
pretty easy to reason about. Not so with breadth-first search.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Breadth-first search is going to require a little bit more care

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to implement it in a way that keeps track of things in the right order.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, as a step towards being able to do that, let's redo depth-first search just the way

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it was done before, but this time without recursion, and what we're going to do the way that we're

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
going to actually make that work is by introducing a new data structure called the open list.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The open list, I would like to think of it as a kind of a "to do list" because it keeps track of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
what it is I need to do next and essentially, I'm a slave to my "to do list."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I've actually had students who occasionally add things to my "to do list" because I wouldn't know

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that I wasn't suppose to do them, and they get me to do things that I'm not suppose to do.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I would not encourage you to be quite so short-sighted, but algorithms actually are going to that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
short-sighted and so this open list is going to help the algorithm keep track of what needs to get done.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So, here's how we're going to do it.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're going to start all the nodes as unmarked so they are all just nice open blue circles,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and we're going to put p onto the open list and we're going to follow this procedure here, and the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
procedure says go to the "to do list" get the thing at the end of the list that has to get done and do it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The way that we are going to do it is we pull it off the list then we go to all the neighbors of the node

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that we're working on which is p and any that are unmarked, we do two things to them.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We mark them and we add them to the open list. So, the neighbors of p in this case are r, s, and q.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So, we're going to add r, s, and q to the open list and mark them all as visited.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now, we've done that process, and we go back to the beginning and do it again.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We take the ending little piece off the "to do list" and say "Oh, q" that's what we have to do.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Go to the graph, find all the neighbors of q in this case just t, mark it and add it to the "to do list."

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Okay, we're done. No, we're not.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We have to go back to the beginning and do it again.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Grab the top thing off the "to do list" which is the t, check all its neighbors, q and u.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Only one of them has not been visited and that's u.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You mark it and add it to the "to do list," and we repeat again.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Grab the last thing off the "to do list," which is u, look at all the neighbors of u which are r, s, and t.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
They've all been marked. Nothing to do.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yes, there is. There is still one more thing on the "to do list."

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We have to get the s, take the s off the list and check all the neighbors of s, u, r, p, and q.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
They've all been visited so we don't add anything new to the "to do list."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We finished the duration and go back to the top. One more thing on the to do list r. Check r.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
R has three neighbors, p, s, and u, all of them have been marked. We add nothing to the open list.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We see that there is nothing left open and now, we're really done. Ta-da.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This procedure here performs just like depth-first search.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It goes through and it adds nodes in an order that has to do with diving deeper

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and deeper into the graph, but it does it without any recursion.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Instead of recursion, it just has this open list to keep track of things.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
All right--here's another graph that we're going to search and this is going to help us

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
illustrate the difference between depth-first search and breadth-first search.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So, what we're going to do is we're going to start a search from v and let's see how it proceeds.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So, we start up v. We mark v.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And our instructions again say that we look at all the neighbors of v, w and z.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Mark the unmarked ones after we removed v on the list

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Mark the unmarked ones and add the unmarked ones to our open list.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now, we take the first thing off the open list which is the z and repeat.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
V is already marked. Y is not. Add y to our open list. Now, we work on y again.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We're always working on the most recent thing.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Y says we have to check x and z, those are the neighbors.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Z has already been marked and x is not.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Take care of x and then just as before and now that everything is marked,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
it's going to end up popping this off the open list and it finishes.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let's look at the order in which nodes were marked.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
This was marked first, then this, then this, then this, then this.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Mostly, the flow is in the order of deeper and deeper and deeper.
