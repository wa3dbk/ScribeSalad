00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.360
The solution of the previous quiz 
said that we had to define

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.660
the wide detail fragment layout
in two places:

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.260
the layout-land 
and the layout-sw600dp folder.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.363
To avoid having 
multiple copies of this file,

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:13.406
we should use layout aliasing.

00:00:13.406 --> 00:00:15.900
We can check the documentation
for layout aliases

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.449
to see an example.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.018
Saw we have a main layout file
that's for one pane UI.

00:00:20.018 --> 00:00:22.617
In the layout-large 
and layout-sw600dp folders,

00:00:22.617 --> 00:00:25.190
we want a multi-pane layout.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.273
In case you're wondering, 
layout-large

00:00:27.273 --> 00:00:29.596
is for backward compatibilty
purposes for large devices

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:31.810
prior to Android 3.2.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.283
That's when the SW qualifiers 
were introduced.

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:35.896
So back to the point.

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:38.290
To avoid code duplication, 
we can define the two pane layout

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.483
in the base layout folder.

00:00:40.483 --> 00:00:43.076
Then, in the values-large
and values-sw600dp folders,

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.450
we can create a reference 
so that the main layout

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.100
actually maps to the two pane layout.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.822
In the Java code, you can
reference it as r.layout.main,

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:53.640
but it's actually referencing 
the two pane layout.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.100
This is what the detail fragment 
should look like afterwards.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.780
And this is what the phone
landscape view looks like.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.340
If you rotate the device,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.460
the phone portrait view 
should be different.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.610
In the next coding task, 
we're going to make

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.040
the today list item 
look more like the other items

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.980
in the list for the tablet.
