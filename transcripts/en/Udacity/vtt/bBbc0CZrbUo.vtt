00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.570
Let's discuss a typical DDOS
attack scenario by botnets.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.390
First, the attacker
decides the victim and

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.010
when the victim machine
should be attacked.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.940
In order to launch a DDOS attack,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680
the attacker must be able
to commandeer a botnet.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.660
Here, we assume that the bots
already have the bot code,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.680
and the bot code communicates
with the attacker regularly.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.700
To start the attack,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.090
the attacker sends the command
to all the bots in the botnet.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.090
For example,
the command would tell the bots to send

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.930
connection request to
the victim at once.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.380
The result is that the victim gets
connection requests from many,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.270
many bots at the same time.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.890
Therefore, the victim
is being overloaded and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.540
the effect of denial of
service is accomplished.
