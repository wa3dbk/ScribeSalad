The answer is no, we can't do that. If we're adding a 1 inside the parentheses,

00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:08.239
then we're adding something, some quantity other than 0 to the right side of the

00:00:08.239 --> 00:00:12.319
equation. And that means we have to do it for the left side as well, otherwise

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:14.749
you'll completely change what graph we have.
