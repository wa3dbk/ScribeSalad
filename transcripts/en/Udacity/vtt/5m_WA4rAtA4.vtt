00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.660
Well it turns out all of these are negative 1. For the first fraction we can

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.928
think about simplifying the common factor of 6. Leaving us with negative 1

00:00:08.928 --> 00:00:12.970
divided by 1 or just negative 1. We can use the same reasoning for the rest of

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.796
the examples. They will all equal negative 1 since we'll have one factor that's

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:21.080
positive in the numerator. And one factor that's negative in the denominator. It

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.730
doesn't matter where the negative sign falls, we just need one of them to be

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.008
negative in order for our answer to be negative one.
