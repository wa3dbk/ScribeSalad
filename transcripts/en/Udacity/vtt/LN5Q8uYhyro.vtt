00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And now we need a calculator--you have a square root of 28 and you divide -1

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
by that square root and gets approximately -0.189 when I work this out.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today's negative correlation but it's weak. The data really in't well-described by a linear function.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If the data instead were to lie exactly on this line then r will be -1 with the negative correlation.
