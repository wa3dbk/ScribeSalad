00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.930
Hi there, my name is Carl and I'd like
to welcome you to SQL for data analysis.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.360
An SQL database is a valuable tool for
managing, organizing, and

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.660
querying your data.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.960
By the end of this course,

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.010
you'll be able to do all this using data
in your own local relational database.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.590
You'll master the basics of SQL,
the language for querying and

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.800
populating databases.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.820
Let's have a look at what you'll
be doing throughout each lesson of

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.150
the course.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.050
In the first lesson you'll learn
some important concepts about how

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.890
we organize data in
relational databases.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.229
In the second lesson, you'll learn
how to use SQL to fetch data out of

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.110
a database and insert new data into it.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.340
And in third lesson, you'll define new
tables, perform more advanced queries

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.270
and extend the power of your analysis
by connecting python to your database.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.870
After each lesson there's
an optional problem set.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.550
These are meant to help you gain even
more familiarity with the SQL language,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.100
while setting up your
own local database.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.800
If you're in the data analyst program,

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.520
this problem sets also focus on getting
you prepared for one of the projects.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.380
To finish this project you'll need to be
able to define schemas, import data, and

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.379
perform queries on data from
the open street maps dataset.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.875
After this course that's
exactly you'll be able to do.

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:09.210
Okay great, let's get started.
