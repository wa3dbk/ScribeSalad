00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The first issue is that we need to do fast modular exponentiation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One of the steps in the protocol is to compute the generator to the XA power modulo Q

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
where XA has to be some large random number.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And it has to be large and random because if an attacker can guess XA

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
well that would break the security of the protocol.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So we need to know that this is possible--

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that we can do exponentiation more quickly than we can do discrete log.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So we're going to explore this with a quiz.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So how many multiplications are needed in order to compute 2 raised to the 20th power?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The straightforward way to do this would be to multiply 2 times 2 twenty times.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
For the quiz, I want you to answer the minimum number of multiplications needed to compute this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I should point out that we're starting assuming that we don't know anything.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Obviously, if you already know the value of 2 to the 20, you can do it without any multiplications.
