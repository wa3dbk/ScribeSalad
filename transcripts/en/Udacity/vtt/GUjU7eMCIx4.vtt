00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.110
Sometimes we only want our code to
execute if it satisfies certain

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.380
conditions.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.990
For instance, I might want to go for
a run but only if it's sunny outside.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.270
If it's raining I'd like
to go to the gym instead.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.830
This can be done in Ruby
with someone's control flow.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.440
We can use special keywords like if,
unless, and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.320
else to guide the logic in our programs.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.490
Let's break apart our previous example.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.110
It's sunny outside,
can be singled out as an expression.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.270
This expression is either true or false.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.890
If and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.890
only if that expression is true we want
to move forward with certain actions.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.620
Let's take a deeper dive into how
we can evaluate expressions and

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.830
use control flow to make
our programs more dynamic.
