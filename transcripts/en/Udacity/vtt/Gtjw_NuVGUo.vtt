00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.330
Let's do another quiz with our BTB and BHT. Same BHT 16 entries perfect. Same

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.840
BTB four entries perfect. Same program with

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.900
the same addresses. The question for you now

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.500
is which BHT entry do we access

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.777
for each instruction? There are 16 entries, numbered

00:00:19.777 --> 00:00:22.609
0 through 15. The question is when

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.289
we are fetching this instruction here, what is

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.103
the BHT entry that we're going to be using to predict

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:31.252
it, and then for this instruction, you need to write it

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:34.590
here, for this instruction, here, and so on. Again there

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.170
are eight instruction, so we need to have eight numbers here.
