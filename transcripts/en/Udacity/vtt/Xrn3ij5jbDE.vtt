00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.640
One straight forward way to solve this it to change the uvs to select the

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.160
numeral. Here's the code that I modified in the square geometry method to make

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.820
this happen. Just for the heck of it, I tried this texture on the teapot. It

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.540
looks pretty cool.
