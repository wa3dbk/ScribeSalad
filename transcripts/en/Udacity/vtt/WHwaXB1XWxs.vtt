00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.772
Let's talk about the thought process in more detail. The first question I asked

00:00:03.772 --> 00:00:08.932
myself was, which nouns in this problem description are doing things? Well, the

00:00:08.932 --> 00:00:14.107
manager is getting assignments, and marking them with priorities, and assigning

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:20.515
them to photographers. Photographers are getting the assignments from the

00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:25.248
manager, and completing them. Assignments don't seem to do too much, but we

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:29.401
need to keep some information associated with the assignments. In particular, I

00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:33.955
thought an assignment would have a priority, and maybe, whether it's finished

00:00:33.955 --> 00:00:38.906
or not. They would also have the original description. Perhaps I would even

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:43.268
want to store the finished work in the assignment. So maybe the finished method

00:00:43.268 --> 00:00:47.759
would take in an assignment. You might also want customer objects. Maybe the

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:51.645
customers are doing something interesting when they create the assignments or

00:00:51.645 --> 00:00:55.473
maybe the manager keeps a list of customers and assigns the priorities based on

00:00:55.473 --> 00:01:01.506
who the customer is. Maybe you would want an object to represent a priority. If

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:04.730
you imagine the priorities as just numbers and higher numbers mean higher

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.485
priorities then you probably wouldn't need a special priority class. But if you

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.485
wanted priorities to age over time, and increase the longer you have the

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:15.735
assignment, then you might want to class your priorities, because they would

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:20.368
have behavior. This kind of design work can be very difficult, because there's

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:23.813
so many ways you might start. But it also becomes a lot of fun as you get

00:01:23.813 --> 00:01:28.623
better at it. This process becomes a kind of story telling. You're using the

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:33.956
code to document the relationships between all of the actors in the story. And

00:01:33.956 --> 00:01:37.360
creating a model for how to solve the problem.
