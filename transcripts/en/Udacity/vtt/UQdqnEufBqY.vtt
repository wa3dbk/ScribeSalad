00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
And of course, here it's time for another quiz.

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.200
So my first quiz to you--you can already see there are going to be two--is what is the size of this table?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:17.710
Is is O(n²), is it O(nv) and you remember v is the sum of all values, or is it even precisely nv?

00:00:17.710 --> 99:59:59.999
And of course, I want you to give me the best possible answer here.
