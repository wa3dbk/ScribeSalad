00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.842
So we'll start with the thread per row approach.

00:00:01.842 --> 00:00:03.775
Let's start with the data structure.

00:00:03.775 --> 00:00:09.171
We're going to use the CSR, the compressed sparse row format here, just as we did in Unit 4.

00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:13.350
Recall that value contains the non-zero elements in the matrix,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.633
index gives the column of each entry,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.430
and row pointer contains the index of the beginning of each row.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.116
So each blue dot here corresponds to the element that begins each row,

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:27.773
which is element 0, 2, 3, and 5.

00:00:27.773 --> 00:00:30.046
So let's just walk through some code.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:35.079
Note this code, like many spmv routines, calculates y+=mx.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.891
So it multiplies m by vector x and then adds it to the element y

00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:42.820
and resets the result as y.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.628
It adds the matrix vector product to the destination vector y.

00:00:46.628 --> 00:00:51.063
We're going to start by this line here computing the global index for each thread.

00:00:51.063 --> 00:00:55.201
The thread with this index i will calculate the result for row i.

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.271
Next we're going to have an if statement, if row less than the number of rows.

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.307
Why do we have this if statement?

00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:03.276
We're going to launch many blocks of many threads,

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:07.431
and it might be that the number of rows is not a perfect multiple of blocks and threads.

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.364
This if statement is a common one in CUDA programs.

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:12.796
Inside the if is the meat of the routine.

00:01:12.796 --> 00:01:16.652
Recall that row pointer contains the indices of the starts of each row.

00:01:16.652 --> 00:01:23.170
So, for instance, the value 3 here says that the third element D here

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.075
is the beginning of a particular row that then contains D and E. So we're going to start with D.

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:32.064
We're going to start at the beginning of a row and we're going to go up to,

00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:36.400
but not including, the first element of the next row, so that's this loop right here.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.278
And at every iteration of that loop we will multiply 2 things.

00:01:40.278 --> 00:01:44.466
One is the value of that element, so in this case D,

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:48.798
and the second is we check which column D is in.

00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:54.922
In this case D is in column 0 so we're going to look up the vector element

00:01:54.922 --> 00:01:58.854
at position 0 and multiply D by that vector element.

00:01:58.854 --> 00:02:04.528
So that's this value times that vector element, and then add that to dot.

00:02:04.528 --> 00:02:08.539
And when we're finally done, we take our destination value y,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.131
add it to dot, and put it back into y.
