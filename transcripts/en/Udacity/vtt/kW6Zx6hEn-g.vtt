00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.030
So what is a script? A script is a knowledge representation for capturing

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:11.100
causally coherent set of events. Casually means that one event sets off another.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.530
So when David goes to the coffee house, as soon as he approaches the counter,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.730
the barista comes to him and says, what do you want? One event has set off

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.170
the next one. Coherent means the links between these events make sense in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.900
the context of the world around us. So in David's script again,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.300
ordering coffee doesn't cause the barista to slap in the face.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.680
Because that would not be causally coherent in the context of the world.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.030
These events are referent to events in the world. Some events, like deciding or

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.510
concluding, might be in the actor's mind, but for

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.890
the most part these events are observable events.
