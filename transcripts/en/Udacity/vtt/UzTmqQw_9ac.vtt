For reasons that can only become clear after a much longer discussion of

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.260
JavaScript class patterns, the keyword this will

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.990
actually get bound to an entirely new object that gets created automatically in

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.790
the background as a result of the keyword new having appeared.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.670
In support of certain object-oriented paradigms,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.660
another object will be generated every time you make a call to

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.280
that function with the keyword new in front of it.
