00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So in case an assert function would not be available in your language,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you could easily roll out your own.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm coming up with my own assert function which I call "my own assert" takes the condition.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
If the condition is false, then we raise an assertion error.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, if I invoke say "my own assert" on 2+2=4,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
very simple test, we can run this and well, nothing happens because the assertion is met.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
However, if we assume the 2+2=5,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
we can run this and we get an assertion error that's being raised in here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and this gives us almost the same functionality as the built-in assertions.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
While you can easily roll out your own assertion,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
built-in assertions typically do have a couple of advantages.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There is identification--the built-in assertion typically tells you which assertion failed.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There is location that tell you where the assertion failed--that is where in the code.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They are optional--meaning that they can be turned on or off

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
although turning assertions off is mostly a bad idea, which we will discuss later.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And finally, they're standardized--meaning that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
everybody can immediately recognize an assertion as such because they always take the same form.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In the languages C and C++ for instance,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
assertions come with a built-in function named "assert" as in Python

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which you get by including a special file assert.h,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and then, as in Python, you use assert except that you put the argument in parenthesis,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and again, you pass the condition as an argument to the assert function.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If this assertion failed, you're going to get a message on the console

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
right before the program exits,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and the message will look something like this--there you go.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And now, you can see that the message actually has everything we wanted in our built-in assertions.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So first, the failing assertion is identified down here as coming directly from the code.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You see the location here--it's in the file foo.c in line 9.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In C and C++, assertions are optional,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
you can turn them on and off using a simple argument to the compiler,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and finally, they're standardized if you include assert.h, that's always the form,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and this is what programmers look for and this is what programmers understand.
