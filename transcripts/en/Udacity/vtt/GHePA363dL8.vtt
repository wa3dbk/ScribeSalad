00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.132
Let's start by considering the left side. To make this no longer a fraction, we

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:08.330
need to multiply both sides to the equation by its denominator. However, doing

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.414
that alone doesn't help us with the right side. To deal with this fraction, we

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:16.474
need to multiply both sides by the quantity 4x plus 2. Now let's see what that

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:20.347
leaves us with. On the left side, multiplying by 7 minus 3x gets rid of the

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:24.531
denominator, but then we still are multiplying by this other factor. I made a

00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:28.499
mistake and forgot to write our parentheses around this entire factor we're

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:32.512
multiply by. That's super important, and clearly, it's very easy mistake to

00:00:32.512 --> 00:00:36.782
make. On the right-hand side, since we're multiplying by 4x plus 2, that deals

00:00:36.782 --> 00:00:41.571
with the denominator. But we still have a factor of 7 minus 3x. Wonderful. This

00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:43.130
is our final answer.
