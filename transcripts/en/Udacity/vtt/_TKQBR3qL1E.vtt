00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.123
Our database will contain 
weather forecast entries.

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.560
Our data model will use two tables:

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:09.464
One table will be used 
to contain information about the location,

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.467
while the other will contain 
the forecast data key to the locations.

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:17.473
These will ultimately be tied back
to our view through the contract,

00:00:17.473 --> 00:00:18.861
and the content provider.

00:00:18.907 --> 00:00:23.417
We can use an inner join, to pull
the complete data for each forecast today,

00:00:23.417 --> 00:00:26.170
including all information about the location.

00:00:26.784 --> 00:00:29.164
This, is a big contract.

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:33.580
Note that we store the location ID, 
which will be a foreign key

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.920
from the location table 
in COLUMN<u>LOC</u>KEY.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.471
Note that the units aren't stored 
in the database.

00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.326
We expect all weather entries 
to be stored in metric units,

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:47.103
and converted when needed 
by the UI, into imperial units.

00:00:47.103 --> 00:00:50.555
Since the column names 
don't actually contain data types,

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:53.347
it's useful to annotate that 
in the variable names

00:00:53.347 --> 00:00:57.238
and/or the comments 
to make our contract more explicit.
