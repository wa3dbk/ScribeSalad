00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.103
You've looked at the behavior of f of x equals 4 over x minus 1, around x

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:09.990
equals 1, right in the middle of the graph. But what's the behavior doing far,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.960
far to the left, and far, far to the right? It doesn't look like any other

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.871
curve we've seen before in the course. Which of these statements right here

00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:22.237
probably describes the behavior of this function, as we move far, far away from

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:27.516
the y axis? Does the curve approach the line y equals o, the x axis, from above

00:00:27.516 --> 00:00:30.938
but never touch it, as x goes either to positive infinity, or negative

00:00:30.938 --> 00:00:36.440
infinity? Does the curve approach y equals 0 from above but not touch it, as x

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.106
goes to infinity. And does it approach y equals 0 from below as x goes to

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:46.344
negative infinity? Does the curve approach Y equals 0 from below, as x goes to

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:51.721
positive infinity, and from above as x goes to negative infinity? Or does the

00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:55.320
curve approach Y equals 0 from below, as x goes to positive infinity and to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.460
negative infinity?
