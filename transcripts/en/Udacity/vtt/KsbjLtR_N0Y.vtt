00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.950
So, now,
let's look at these steps one at a time.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.040
Let's first look at the prediction step.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:05.870
Okay?

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.120
So our prediction step is, given some

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.840
belief about X of, at t minus one,
and given the measurements

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.270
all the way up through t minus one,
make a prediction of Xt.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.400
State of time t, still given only the
measurements through time t minus one.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.470
The way we do that and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.990
I'm, It's going to be written out
here in, in sort of a standard way.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.770
And then we're going to make
specific use of that both,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.370
especially in particle filtering
which we'll do in a little bit.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.570
What, the way you would do
that is what's known as,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.610
you use the law of total probability and
marginalization, allright?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.880
So the law of total
probability marginalization,

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.340
I'm only supposed to
be reminding you here,

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.750
you're supposed to remember all
your probability theory, right?

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.420
Then if I've got a joint density,
right, P of a and b.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.250
If I integrate that over all the b's

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.270
what I'm left with is
the density over a.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.270
Allright.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.220
That's marginalization.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.364
So what I'm going to do here is the idea
is well if I had a joint density of

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:13.710
xt minus one,index t and I were to
integrate over all the xt minus ones,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.880
I would just have the density over xt,
so that's the marginalization.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.790
And, the reason we do
that is we can then

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.560
break that integral up
into the following, right?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.580
So, you might remember the conditioning,
right, probability of A and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.420
B is the probability of A given B
times the probability of B, it's

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.120
what it says down here, so I've just
broken up this integral down into this.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.040
Where here's the probability of xt minus
one given everything up to t minus one.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.326
And I multiple that times the
probability of xt given xt minus one and

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:50.090
everything else.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.710
So I'm just applying the conditioning
property to that interval.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.965
And then I can use that independence
assumption that we said before.

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:04.730
Remember, the independence assumption Is
that if I want the probability of xt,

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.320
and I'm given the previous state, and

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.220
a bunch of other things,
those other things don't matter.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.060
The only thing that matters
is that previous state.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.720
That's our dynamics model.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.690
So, basically, we have two things here.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.800
We have our belief.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.990
About t minus onr,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.560
giving everything up through t minus
one and then we have our dynamics.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.840
Those are the two components that
it takes in order to make that

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.870
guess going forward.
