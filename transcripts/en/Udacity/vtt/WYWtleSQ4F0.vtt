00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All right, so now we're in a good position to define the set p of polynomial time decidable problems.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So this is a set, this includes a bunch of problems, a problem is in the set if there's an algorithm

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
for that problem such as that when inputs size n, the running time for solving that problem

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is in big O then to the k for some constant k.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So there has to be some kind of polynomial upper bound of an algorithm

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to solve that problem for the problem to be in p.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This k--this constant k is allowed to vary with the class of the problem, but any particular instance

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
still needs to be solved and into the k.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So it's nÂ˛--they're at the end of the fifth--whatever it happens to be.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And just in case it's not obvious, running times like Î˜ of logn are in big O nk for some k.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In this case, k=1 suffices.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The class p is often contrasted with the class np that I'm going to define next.
