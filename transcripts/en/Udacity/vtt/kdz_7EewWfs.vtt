00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.010
So here is the algorithm that we now need to translate into Java. Let's do it.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.982
I declare a variable to hold the sum. I declare a loop to visit all of the

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:14.014
pictures in the gallery. The enhanced for loop will do nicely here because I need

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:18.560
to visit all of the pictures and I don't care in which order. For each picture,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.538
I compute its width and I update the sum. At the end of the loop the sum will

00:00:22.538 --> 00:00:26.922
be the sum of all of the widths and here it is printed. That's all. Let's move

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.240
on to our next algorithm.
