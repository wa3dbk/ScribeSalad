Hello and welcome to Project 1.5
of the iOS Developer Nanodegree.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.370
I say project because everything that
follows here is completely optional.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.350
What we're doing is trying to
give you the opportunity to start

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.129
thinking about your
final portfolio project

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.660
where you'll build an app of your own
creation completely from the ground up.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.120
Now you might be thinking, hey,
I'm totally not ready for that.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.030
I just got here.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.470
I just did a course in Xcode and
I don't know what I might want to build.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.140
And that's totally fine.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.710
All of the content will
be repeated in the final

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.740
course which shows you how to
build an app from scratch.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.530
But if you want to get started now,
we'll give you some tips and

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.810
tricks on how to brainstorm
an awesome idea.
