When we experience different emotions, different parts of our body respond

00:00:03.658 --> 00:00:07.900
differently. Many of the bodily systems involve the autonomic nervous system,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.912
which includes a sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. As you may

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:17.787
recall from lesson three, the sympathetic nervous system is the arousal system.

00:00:17.787 --> 00:00:21.563
It readies the body for action, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:26.634
brings the levels of arousal levels down so we can calm down. Basic survival

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:30.587
and protection experiences activate the sympathetic nervous system to either

00:00:30.587 --> 00:00:35.400
fight or flight, meaning flee. Different emotions have their own pattern of

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.095
arousal. Anger, for instance, increases heart rate and skin temperature,

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:45.490
whereas sadness decreases both. And fear increases heart rate somewhat and

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.783
sweating. And positive emotions generally activate the parasympathetic nervous

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:55.009
system, leading to a sense of calm or relaxation.
