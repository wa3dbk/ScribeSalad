A potential challenge with big data is that it is

00:00:03.326 --> 00:00:07.680
created very fast. And does come from different sources, which could

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.410
be in a variety of formats. In my experience, most data

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.110
is not worthless. But actually does have a lot of value.
