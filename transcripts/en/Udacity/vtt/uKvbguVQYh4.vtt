00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.940
Why don't you try your hand at using the numpy.dot function?

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.890
Imagine a scoring system in which each country is awarded four points for

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.700
each gold medal, two points for each silver medal, and one point for

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.438
each bronze medal.

00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:17.970
Using the numpy.dot function, create a new dataframe called olympic_points_df

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.150
that includes a column called country_name with the country name and points with

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.030
the total number of points that that country earned at the Sochi olympics.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.030
Your code should go here.
