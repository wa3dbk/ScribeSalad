00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.835
Let's say that we have some real number a, that is nonnegative. As in, a is just

00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:09.284
not negative. It's either zero or it's positive. What then can we say the

00:00:09.284 --> 00:00:13.818
absolute value of a is equal to? And if make a negative, if we multiply a by

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:17.501
negative 1, then what is the absolute value of that number?
