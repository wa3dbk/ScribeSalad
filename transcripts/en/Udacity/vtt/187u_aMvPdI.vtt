00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.868
We have been talking a lot of about interfaces and how useful they are, now I

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:07.467
would like to bring up a related topic called inheritance, and interface

00:00:07.467 --> 00:00:13.249
specifies behavior that the class that implements it should exhibit.

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.849
Inheritance can do a little better than that, when a class inherits from

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.631
another class it picks up behavior and data. Here is an example of a set of

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:27.093
classes, where one would probably use inheritance, to model them. We have a

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:32.331
class vehicle, it's a very general class. A car is a special kind of a vehicle,

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:37.663
a motorcycle is another kind of a vehicle, a truck is a kind of vehicle. And an

00:00:37.663 --> 00:00:42.532
SUV is a kind of car. Now you would use inheritance not interfaces in this

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:48.058
situation because you could put common data into the vehicle class. Such as the

00:00:48.058 --> 00:00:53.297
weight of the vehicle, the number of wheels, things like that. Now you might

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:57.270
say why not always use inheritance? It seems better. But there are two issues

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.016
with it. One is, it is complex, and also a class can only inherit from one

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:07.410
class, whereas a class can implement as many interfaces as it likes. A bit of

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.030
terminology, the class from which one inherits is called the super-class, and

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.265
the class that does the inheriting is called the sub-class. We would say truck

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:24.947
is a sub-class of vehicle. Vehicle, has a super-class, of truck. Just to see

00:01:24.947 --> 00:01:27.700
that you're paying attention, let me ask you, what are the sub-classes of car?

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.735
What are the super-classes of car, the sub-classes of SUV, and the

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:34.595
super-classes of SUV, in our inheritance hierarchy over here? Just put your

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:40.070
answers into these boxes.
