00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.370
How do we go about realizing the dependency inversion principle for

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.180
the coffee maker example? First, we express what we have done so far as

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.320
abstract classes. Then we subclass each of them for the mark four. The subclass

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.590
versions implement the abstract methods by calling the coffee makers API.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.050
Also the subclasses, when communicating with, with each other, use call to,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.460
calls to the abstract methods not to the specific versions for the mark four.
