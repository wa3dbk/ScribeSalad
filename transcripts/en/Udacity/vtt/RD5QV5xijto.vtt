00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.430
Okay, so the way you can think about this question is by looking at the first

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.820
message and why it makes sense to have two bits per symbol. So you can be

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.200
present this bit pattern in a tree. So when a new bit comes in, it can be

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.720
either 0 or a 1. If it's a 0, the next

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.212
symbol can be another 0 or it can be 1. The same case here, so if there are

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:30.802
two 0s, it is an A, if it is a 0 followed by 1, it is a B, if it is a 1 followed

00:00:30.802 --> 00:00:36.090
by 0, it is a C, if it is a 1 followed by 1, it is a D. So that

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.130
is why you need to ask two questions to reach either

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.470
of these symbols. What happens in this new language? So in

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.280
the this new language, it occurs 50% of the time. So

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.390
we can directly ask if it is A or not A.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.450
So that's represent that has 0 or 1, and let A be

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.490
0. So now we got our A as just a 0. Now if we go on the one

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.710
branch we can again ask, if it was a 0 or a 1. Now observe that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.170
D occurs twice as frequently as B or C. So,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.864
in this case we can be present D here using 1, 0 and

00:01:15.864 --> 00:01:18.780
then B or C can occur on this branch

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.220
but both cannot occur at the same place, so we

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.028
need to differentiate between them using another symbol. So

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:28.050
let's do that using 0 and 1 again. So this

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.872
can be B and this can be C. So B is basically 1, 1, 0 and C will be

00:01:34.872 --> 00:01:38.760
1, 1, 1. Now have we actually saved any

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.120
bits per symbol, have we saved the number of questions

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.370
we asked? Yes because A occurs more frequently and I needed to ask only one

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.100
question. But what is the exact number of questions we are to ask for symbols?
