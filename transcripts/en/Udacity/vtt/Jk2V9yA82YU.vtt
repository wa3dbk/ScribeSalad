00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.370
So this is the framework that we're going to be using

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.600
through most of the discussions that we'll be having at least

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.860
on reinforcement learning. The single

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.730
agent reinforcement learning, and it's called

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.850
the Markov Decision Process. This should sound familiar to you, Michael.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.580
&gt;&gt; Well, you did say we're going to talk about decisions.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.904
&gt;&gt; That's true, and we need a process for making decisions. And we're going

00:00:21.904 --> 00:00:24.204
to introduce something called the Markovian property

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:25.400
as a part of this discussion and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.810
I'll tell you exactly what that means in a moment.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.010
So, I'm just going to write out this frame work and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.110
just, and tell you what it is and what the

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.030
problem it produces for us. And then we're going to start

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.360
talking about solutions through the rest of the discussion. So

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.960
a Markov Decision Process tries to capture worlds like this

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.840
one by dividing up in the following way. We say

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.810
that there are states. And states are a set of tokens

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.550
that somehow represent every state, for lack of a better word, that

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.430
one could be in. So, does that make sense to you, Michael?

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.910
&gt;&gt; So what would the states be in the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.990
world that we've been playing around in so far?

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.709
&gt;&gt; So, the only thing that differs from

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.440
moment to moment is where, I guess, I am.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.470
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.250
&gt;&gt; Like, which grid, grid position I'm in.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.350
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.120
&gt;&gt; So, I feel like each different grid position I could

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.270
be in is a state, maybe there's a state for being successfully

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.070
done or unsuccessfully done?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.880
&gt;&gt; It's possible. But let's stick with the simple one. I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.360
like that one because that's really, I think, easy to grasp. So,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.080
there are at least, of all the states one could reach,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.110
there's, well let's see there's four times three minus one, since you

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.990
can never reach this state. Although we could say it is

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.330
a state we just happen to never reach it. So, at most

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.350
if we just think of this grid literally as a grid there

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.400
are something like twelve different states. And we can represent these states

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.352
as their X,Y coordinates, say. We could call

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:47.304
this, the start state as say 1,1, which

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:53.450
is sort of how I described it earlier. We could describe the goal state as 4,4.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.670
And say this is how we describe our

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.380
states. Or frankly, it doesn't matter. We could

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.870
call these states 1,2,3 up to 12. Or we could name them Fred and Marcus. It

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.620
doesn't really matter. The point is

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.639
that they're states, they represent something, and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.106
we have some way of knowing which state we happen to be in. Okay?

00:02:14.106 --> 00:02:15.062
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:16.018
&gt;&gt; Okay.
