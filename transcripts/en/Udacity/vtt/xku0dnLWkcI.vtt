00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.564
So here is the real question, suppose you use

00:00:02.564 --> 00:00:04.509
this confidence interval to detect abnormal

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.247
behavior and abnormal behavior mean, you go to

00:00:07.247 --> 00:00:09.238
your boss and you complain, he’ll stop trading

00:00:09.238 --> 00:00:12.473
then how often during a day would you expect to

00:00:12.473 --> 00:00:15.868
detect abnormal behavior in your trading, or

00:00:15.868 --> 00:00:18.871
differently how frequently does this confidence

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:21.388
internal trigger on any given single day.
