00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.012
The answer is two, three, five, three, two we start out with i as zero so

00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:09.910
primes four takes on the value of prime zero, so 11 is replaced with two, now

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.678
we go through again but this time i is one. So we look at primes three, and

00:00:17.678 --> 00:00:23.628
fill it with the values from primes one. So seven is replaced with three. And i

00:00:23.628 --> 00:00:26.840
would be two, so we break out of the loop.
