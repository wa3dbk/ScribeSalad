00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.890
In this lesson, 
we learned how to create

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.560
rich, responsive user interfaces
that work across a variety

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.530
of different hardware types 
and screen sizes.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.920
We also learned more details
on the Android layout managers

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.240
and screen widgets,

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.570
and even how to create
our own views from scratch.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.960
Join us for lesson six where 
we take our foreground-only app

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.860
and discover how
to make it update and trigger

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.670
notifications from the background.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.670
All without draining your battery.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.462
But first, join me back at Google

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:28.392
for another story
from the Android history books.
