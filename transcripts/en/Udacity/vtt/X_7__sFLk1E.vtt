00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
You have learned quite a lot in the last six units.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.060
You have learned about how to recognize that a problem is difficult to solve.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.340
You have learned about the theory of NP completeness surrounding those problems,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.200
and you have also learned some powerful techniques to deal with NP complete problems

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.460
so that they might even be solvable in practice despite their general hardness.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.960
Now, there's one question we haven't yet looked at and that is kind of the ultimate question.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.410
Are there any problems that no computer, no matter how powerful,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.020
no matter with how much time is able to solve, and the answer surprisingly turns out to be yes.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.960
In this unit, I will show you that there are some deceptively simple problems

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.850
for which we can prove that no computer,

00:00:43.850 --> 99:59:59.000
no matter how powerful will ever be able to solve them.
