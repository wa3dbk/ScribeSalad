00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.850
Let's do another quiz about history predictors. Let's

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.680
say we have a program in which we have

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.460
two nested loops. One i goes from zero through

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.930
seven. And then within we have a nested loop

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.940
of j goes from zero through seven. Let's say

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.530
we do something that doesn't have much branching behavior

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.340
in it. This type of nested loop structure is

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.320
very common when you have things like matrices or

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.820
even image processing. In particular, for image processing, it's

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.470
very common. For example, compression or decompression are working in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.930
blocks of, let's say, 8 by 8 pixels in this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.610
case which will mean that there are loops like this

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.130
all over the code. Let's say that the code, when

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.980
it does this nested loop, just does something else and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.140
then very quickly comes back to it to do another

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.510
round of this, so this is not just executed once,

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.910
the whole thing is executed many, many times. If we are building a history

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.240
based predictor that should do well on this code, it needs at least how many

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.880
entries, and each of these entries should

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.290
have, how many bits of history, and how

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.840
many 2 bit counters do we need to enter as a result of this history?
