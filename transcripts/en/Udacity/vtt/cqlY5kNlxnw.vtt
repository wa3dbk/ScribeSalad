00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.673
So now, I want you to place the following activities in the appropriate boxes

00:00:03.673 --> 00:00:08.701
on the consciousness chart. Deep sleep, coma, practicing the piano, lucid

00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:14.400
dreaming, which means knowing that you are dreaming, and vegetative state.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.152
Place the appropriate number in the appropriate box on this chart of awareness

00:00:19.152 --> 00:00:24.296
and wakefulness. Remember, farther up means you're really aware, farther down

00:00:24.296 --> 00:00:29.057
means you're not aware. Farther to the right means you're really awake, farther

00:00:29.057 --> 00:00:31.829
to the left means you're not awake.
