00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.310
The answer is that in general I would think that algorithm A would be preferable to algorithm B

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:13.090
because the running time of algorithm A is 3n² -n+10 and here we have 2ⁿ.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.160
So just ask what the algorithm of Alice, this function here would grow very fast

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.040
if and increases, but of course this is only a very general statement.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.060
So in general you have to be a bit more careful about choosing algorithms even if the running times

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.000
deviate like this because as we said before we are taking worst-case running time

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.460
so maybe the average-case running time of algorithm B is much better than of algorithm A

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.300
and also we might be dealing with very small inputs.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.320
So if you would know that n for example does not get much bigger than 10,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.540
then those 2 algorithms are almost equal or sometimes even algorithm B would be preferable,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.610
but in general, if you don't have any other information, I would go with algorithm A

00:00:53.610 --> 99:59:59.000
because the running time is much lower than the running time here as long as n is not very small.
