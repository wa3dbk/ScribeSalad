00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
If we had a solver of order 4, remember the forward Euler method is of order 1.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we had a solver of order 4, and if we wanted to shrink the error by a factor of 10,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we want to gain one decimal place in accuracy,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
by which factor do we need to change the number of steps?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Should we be using 50% more, 80% more, twice as many, 10 times as many steps?
