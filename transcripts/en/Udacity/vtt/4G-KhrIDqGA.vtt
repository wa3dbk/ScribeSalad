00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.500
Two of my favorite charts, they were not listed in the flow chart,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.270
are tables, or simply just text and maps.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.310
A table isn't traditionally thought of as a tool for visualization.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.870
But sometimes if your data doesn't have any inherent structure or

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.780
order, a table is the most natural choice.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.540
Tables typically are used to represent summaries of data or

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.200
somewhat disjoint facts.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.330
In this example, we'll be looking at states and their corresponding state bird.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.020
Since states do have some geographical representation,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.940
we may want to represent them on a map.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.330
But since State Bird is simply a label or category, it may be hard to represent

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.090
in one of the other visual encodings that correspond with a geographic map.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.470
Typically, with a map, you have either the size or

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.090
color of some geographic region, or some points to plot.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.220
In our case, we simply want to look up what state and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.250
find the corresponding state bird.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.450
Tables work well when there is no in-hand relation between the data

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.810
you're conveying.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.569
Since we simply want a state to state bird mapping,

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:08.040
we can use a table as something of a look up mechanism.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.460
Maps are interesting, because they are something of a compound visual coding.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.660
A map is simply an x and a y coordinate combined with some geographic context,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.290
often the case of latitude and longitude.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.750
And when combined, we get a mapping of an x and

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.660
a y pixel coordinate to some latitude and longitude, which equals a map.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.600
I quickly wanted to go over one of my favorite visualizations for its simplicity

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.750
and power, by Dustin Cable from the Wilden Cooper Center for Public Service.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.460
With this visualization,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.110
we have many visual encodings going on in the same space.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.960
Every point on the map is actually one person from the U.S. census.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.090
The color of the dot corresponds to their race as reported on the census.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.780
And the x and y pixel position of the map correspond to the latitude and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.570
longitude of the census block from which the person reported their race.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.360
What's truly stunning with this visualization is that nowhere in

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.590
the graphic are state or city borders drawn.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.470
The natural structure of the United States and the population density

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.960
across the United States naturally falls over the fact that every dot represents

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.070
a person, and most the people in the United States are reported on the census.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.110
The map we have drawn here only uses two visual encodings, the x and

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.810
y coordinate for position, and one visual encoding, the color, for the race.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.090
There are just a few other geographic charts that I want to talk about.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.400
A choropleth map represents some value by color and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.070
plots it geographically across a region.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.100
Typically, you may see this as States of the United States,

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.300
which have a different color representing the intensity of some value.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.370
Going back to the previous example of unemployment,

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.760
we might represent the unemployment of every state as some range of colors.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.250
A map that's very similar to a choropleth, but

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.210
uses a different visual encoding to encode its value is a cartogram.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.240
A cartogram represents some geographic data, and

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.830
uses the size of the geographic region to encode often some continuous value.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.070
Again, going back to the unemployment example, rather than

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.010
representing the unemployment rate of a state by its color with a choropleth,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.705
we can represent it by the size of the state, geographic region that we draw.

00:03:30.705 --> 00:03:33.380
And just reviewing what we just covered with the dot map,

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.240
a dot map could actually represent any shape.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.040
In the case of the example I've shown,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.810
it was similar to a scatter plot where we represent our data with circles, and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.270
how it corresponds to some geographic change.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.280
The map we just went over is an interesting combination of a choropleth and

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.810
a dot map in a way,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.570
since it uses some geographic data with a shape, in our case a circle.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.120
And some color to encode another secondary value for each point.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.130
And as always, there are many other chart types that I'll not cover here but

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.720
are typically some sort of compound chart in the way a choropleth or

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.370
a chartogram combines elements from two simpler chart types.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.250
In the resources section of the class, you can find an exhaustive list

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.170
of most every comment chart type that people use.
