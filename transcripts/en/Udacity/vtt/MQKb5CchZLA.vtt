Okay, congratulations on finishing unit 2. Let's recap what we've learned.

00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:07.790
So you learned about how threads communicate with each other through memory and how

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.179
they can access that memory efficiently when operating in concert.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.699
Along the way, we've learned a few things about the GPU hardware, like its memory model,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.570
and what assumptions we can and cannot make about when threads will run.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.230
Now you'll have a chance to put those concepts into practice.

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:24.659
You'll implement a simple image blurring operation. Jen Hahn will tell you more.
