I know this is a perfect square since 7x squared is 49x squared. 4 is also a

00:00:05.254 --> 00:00:10.724
perfect square, since 2 squared equals 4. So, the a is really 7x, and the b is

00:00:10.724 --> 00:00:15.794
really positive 2. We can factor the difference of squares as a plus b times a

00:00:15.794 --> 00:00:22.510
minus b. So the two factors are 7x plus 2 and 7x minus 2. This is our answer.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.542
You could have also switched the order of the factors and you would still have

00:00:26.542 --> 00:00:27.463
gotten it right.
