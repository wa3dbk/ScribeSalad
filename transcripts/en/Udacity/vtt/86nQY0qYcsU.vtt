00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:02.463
Now I offer these as a fictitious example – these

00:00:02.463 --> 00:00:03.045
are relatively

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:05.598
large numbers. But what’s important to notice

00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:10.246
is the chances of dying in a hospital are 40

00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:13.524
times as large than dying at home. That

00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:16.889
means whether you die or not is correlated

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:18.939
to whether or not you are in a hospital. So

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.574
the chances of dying in a hospital are indeed

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:25.189
40 times larger than at home. So let me ask

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:27.728
the critical question. Shall you now stay at

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:30.060
home, given that you are a really smart

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.172
statistics student, can you resist the temptation

00:00:33.172 --> 00:00:36.272
to go to the hospital because indeed it

00:00:36.272 --> 00:00:40.000
might increase your chances of passing away.
