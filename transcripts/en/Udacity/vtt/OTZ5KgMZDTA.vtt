00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.726
For your next feet of coding magic, I'd like you to write a method that returns

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:08.658
the location of the first occurrence of Mad Hatter in the text. I'd also like

00:00:08.658 --> 00:00:11.634
you to add a line to the tester program, so that it prints the location of the

00:00:11.634 --> 00:00:15.690
first occurrence in Mad hatter. For this one it's okay if you just print the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.807
actual and not the expected. What is the actual value? What is the location it

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:20.470
prints?
