00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.536
To make our Algebra a little bit easier, I'm going to call the length of the

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:07.073
hypotenuse l for just a moment. We're just going to use this other variable to

00:00:07.085 --> 00:00:10.635
describe it. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem, that if I square each of

00:00:10.647 --> 00:00:14.477
these sides and add them together, I'll get l squared. Then, we just need to

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:18.870
simplify this left side of the equation. I could distribute the exponent of 2 to

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:23.875
all of the factors and then add like terms. Since we want to get l by itself, we

00:00:23.887 --> 00:00:28.620
need to take the square root of both sides. Or in other words, I need to take

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:33.250
both sides to the 1 half power. On the right side I just get l and on the left

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:37.735
side, I get 2x. So, our final answer is, that the length of the hypotenuse

00:00:37.747 --> 00:00:38.345
equals 2x.
