00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.123
We can use these values for h and k and insert them into that general expanded

00:00:06.123 --> 00:00:12.035
form of the equation for a parabola to rewrite this, like this. Y equals x

00:00:12.035 --> 00:00:18.396
squared minus 2 times negative 3x plus negative 3 squared plus negative 4. Now,

00:00:18.396 --> 00:00:22.976
we're ready to write this in the form we saw those other equations in. Y minus k

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:27.586
equals the quantity x minus h squared. Please do that in this box right here.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:31.840
Once you've done that, I'd also like to, to tell me the coordinates of the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.385
vertex of this parabola.
