00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.350
Here, the only values of m that make the inequality true are in interval II.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.240
The numbers between negative 2 3rds and positive 5. In the first interval, we

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.564
can test the number that's less than negative 2 3rds. Well, negative 1 is less

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:19.220
than negative 2 3rds. We know this since negative 1 can be rewritten as

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.040
negative 3 3rds. We want to plug in negative 1 instead of negative 3 3rds,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.080
since it's easier to work with an integer than it is with a fraction.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.778
Substituting the value of negative 1, m for m. We get the inequality statement

00:00:31.778 --> 00:00:36.376
that 6 is less than or equal to 0. We know this isn't true, so interval I is

00:00:36.376 --> 00:00:41.830
false. Next, we want to test the value in interval II. I think the easiest

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.625
value to test in this region would be 0. When we plug in 0 for m, we lose these

00:00:46.625 --> 00:00:52.760
two terms to get negative 10 is less than or equal to 0, which we know is true.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.102
So yes, these values can be included in our solution set. And finally, we test

00:00:57.102 --> 00:01:02.226
a number in interval III. I'm going to use the number 6. You could of course

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:05.990
use other numbers, 10 would have been another great one to use. Plugging in 6

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.490
in for m will get the inequality 20 is less than or equal to 0. This isn't

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.740
true, so we know that this part is not included in our solution set.
