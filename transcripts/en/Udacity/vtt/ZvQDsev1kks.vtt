00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
The question that we are, for that matter, Alice, Bob, and Carol were stuck with

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.550
at the end of the previous unit was that they had only been able to find

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.740
exponential time algorithms for these 3 problems here,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.760
and those algorithms did not show any acceptable running time.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.400
So the question they were stuck with is, did they just not think hard enough

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.180
to find good algorithms for their problems, or are their problems intractable,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.940
which would mean that it's not even possible or at least highly unlikely

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.369
to find a polynomial time algorithm for those problems?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.390
And this is what we'll investigate further in this unit.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.240
And I'm not yet going to reveal the answer to you but what I am going to tell you is that

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.050
without realizing it by asking this question, if their problems are tractable or intractable,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.800
Alice, Bob, and Carol are currently pondering what is by many seen

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.000
as one of the toughest questions in computer science--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.070
the famous P vs. NP problem.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.570
And in this unit, I want to show you 4 things.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.640
First, what these letters mean. Second, what the problem is actually all about.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.800
So what this here means.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.830
Third, what Alice, Bob, and Carol have actually to do with a P vs. NP problem.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.250
And then, last but not the least, how you could become an instant millionaire.

00:01:15.250 --> 99:59:59.000
That's not bad for one unit, is it?
