00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
So now let's look at this statement in a slightly different way.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.690
What would happen if you showed 1 NP complete problem

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.580
to be solvable only in exponential time.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.570
So it's not solvable in polynomial time,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.710
you show for 1 NP complete problem

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.430
that requires exponential time to solve,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.420
on a deterministic RAM again, of course.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.200
So would that mean that

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.110
some problems in NP are

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.240
only solvable in exponential time?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.490
Would it mean that all NP complete problems

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.130
are only solvable in exponential time?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.450
or would it mean that all problems in NP

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.560
are only solvable in exponential time?

00:00:35.560 --> 99:59:59.000
So please, once more, check all of those that are correct.
