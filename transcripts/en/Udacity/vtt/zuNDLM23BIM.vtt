00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
Composition of functions also shows how 
different functions are related to one another.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.930
In fact, sometimes it can be helpful to 
figure out how we might write functions

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.172
as compositions of other functions. 
For instance, let's say we have the

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:18.912
function h of x equals x plus 3 squared. 
I'd like to find two functions f and g,

00:00:18.912 --> 00:00:23.490
such that, f of g of x is equal to h of 
x.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.860
What do you think these two functions 
could be?

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.588
Now, I personally think this is a hard 
problem, but it's not a big deal at all

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:32.502
if this takes you few tries. 
Just think about what operations are

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:35.638
being performed here on x to give us h of 
x.

00:00:35.638 --> 00:00:39.544
And think about what order we have to do 
them in and therefore what functions

00:00:39.544 --> 00:00:44.636
correspond to those different operations. 
At the end, check your answer, by

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:49.570
plugging in what you have for g of x. 
As the input of f, and see if you end up

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.923
with h of x.
