00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.840
We'll generate our key pair on our
local machine, not on our server.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.090
Remember, you never, ever want to share
your private key with anyone else.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.160
It should remain firmly in
your possession at all times.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.550
For this reason,
you always generate key pairs locally.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.430
If you were to generate
the key pair on the server,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.470
you cannot claim that the private
key has always been private.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.870
We'll generate our key pair using
an application called ssh-keygen.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.010
You will first be asked to give
a file name for the key pair.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.370
I've given this one the name
users/udacity/.ssh/linuxcourse.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.800
This directory here is the default
directory that key pairs should exist

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.000
in, so
I advise you to keep that the same.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.290
But you can name it what you'd like.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.240
We'll then add a pass
phrase to our key pair,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.470
just in case someone does
happen to get these files.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.100
This pass phrase will prevent
them from actually using them.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.847
Once done, you'll see that
ssh-keygen has generated two files,

00:00:56.847 --> 00:00:59.533
linuxCourse and linuxCourse.pub.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.290
This file, linuxCourse.pub,

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.920
is what we'll place on our server
to enable key based authentication.
