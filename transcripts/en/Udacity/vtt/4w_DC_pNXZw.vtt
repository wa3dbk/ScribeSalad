PAS allocated a private
IP address by default and

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.915
cannot be reached
outside of the cluster.

00:00:04.915 --> 00:00:09.010
I used a kubectl port-forward
command to map a local port

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.320
to a port inside the monolith pod.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.710
Use two terminals.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.460
One to run the kubectl
port-forward command and

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.850
the other to issue kernel commands.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.550
Now in our new terminal we'll
start talking to our pod.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.490
Okay.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.935
Let's see what happens when
we hit the secure end point.

00:00:24.935 --> 00:00:30.760
Uh-oh, let's try logging in to get
it off token back from our monolith.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.030
I'll use the super secret
password password as my password.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.535
We'll use the JWT token from the output
to hit our secure endpoint and

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:44.245
it works and
everything is good in the world again.

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:48.145
Here is the kubectl logs command to
view the logs for the monolith pod.

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:51.230
Let's open another terminal and

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.710
use the -f flag to get a stream
of logs happening in real time.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.120
And as you can see,
the logs are updating in real time.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.239
We can use kubectl exec command
to run an interactive show

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.140
inside the model of POD.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.650
This come in handy when you want
troubleshoot from within the container.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.082
For example, once we have a shell
into the mile of container we

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:16.250
can test external connectivity
using the ping command.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.282
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:01:18.282 --> 00:01:22.060
Then when you're done with the
interactive show, be sure to log out.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.550
As you can see, interacting with PAS is
as easy as using the kubectl command,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.240
whether you're trying to hit
your containers remotely or

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.680
trying to get a log in shell for
troubleshooting.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.650

you need to get up and going.
