Specifically, I want you to do the following. Remove this call to translate.

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:08.728
We'll re-arrange the pictures in a separate loop. In this loop we will look at

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:13.250
a picture and the one to the left of it. The picture is at index i and the one

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.578
to the left at index i minus 1. Call getMaxX on the picture to the left. And

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:22.949
use that value to position pic, go ahead and give it a try.
