00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.980
&gt;&gt; That was correct, David. Now this particular problem might look very simple.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.430
Because for you and me as humans, going from this state to this state is almost

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.720
trivial. But notice how many different questions arose in trying to analyze

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.450
this problem. Clearly, you and I as humans must be addressing these issues.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.510
This kind of A.I anaylsis makes explicit what is usually tacit when humans solve

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.830
this problem. And that is one of the powers of A.I.. Indeed we have left a lot

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.170
of questions unanswered. But each unanswered question then requires an answer.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.200
Now we know that if you must develop methods that somehow will help to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.640
address those questions. Like genetic [x] tests and like [x] dialysis.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.480
Problem reduction is a universal method. It is applicable very large class of

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.860
problems. Once again, problem reduction does not provide guarantee of successes.
