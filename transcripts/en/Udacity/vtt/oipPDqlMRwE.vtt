00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.960
At this point, I want to pause and connect the code that

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.400
we've written thus far to an image we saw previously in the course.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.350
Here we tried to divide the different parts of our app into three camps.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.200
I also want to investigate our code and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.860
find out why is this programming file called ViewController?

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.880
What do those words view and controller even mean?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.793
The place where this conversation starts is with an acronym.

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:30.800
MVC, or model, view, and controller.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.950
And what this is, is a way to design or

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.280
make software applications like the app that we are making.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.650
Let's begin with what is a view?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.390
Simply put, a view is what the user sees or

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.560
is what is really visual on the screen.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.330
So in our case, that would be buttons like the microphone button and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.060
labels like the recording in progress label.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.360
If you look at the document outline, you will notice that the microphone button,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.180
the recording in progress label,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.140
the stop button, they all form a part of our view.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.410
To highlight the view on our screen, I can change its background color.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.400
I can simply slide out the utility area and change the background color.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.970
Boom.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.470
Done.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.890
Then let's think about the model.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.280
This refers to the data of our app.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.120
Now, we do not have one explicitly defined just yet.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.660
But when we record our audio in lesson four, that audio file, including the name

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.690
of the file, the date it was recorded, that will all become a part of our model.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.890
And finally let's talk about the controller.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.960
A controller, as its name suggests,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.370
controls conversations between the model and the view.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.960
In our case, that is the ViewController.swift file.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.650
When a user presses on a button, like the microphone button,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.840
the controller handles that using an action.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.020
Also, when a controller wants to change something in a view, like show and

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.550
hide this recording in progress label, it uses an outlet.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.540
Now, a valid question to ask at this point is, why do all of this?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.440
Well, the most important advantage is that we

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.560
can separate the major components of our app.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.910
This helps in building large apps and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.810
in making changes to them at a later stage.
