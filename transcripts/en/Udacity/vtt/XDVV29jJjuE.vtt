00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.270
When you have a picture, you can think of it as a giant two-dimensional array

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.336
of colors. It's a little tedious to work with the colors because they have red,

00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:12.032
blue, and green components. Here, we'll just use grayscale. Each element in the

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:16.633
two-dimensional array will represent a gray level. As an integer between zero

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.495
and 255. Now, here's the problem that we want to solve, we have a photo, which

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:24.778
is represented as a two-dimensional array, of lots of grey level. And now we

00:00:24.778 --> 00:00:28.430
want to make it a little blockier. When I have groups of four neighbors like

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.770
this, I want to compute the average color or rather the average gray level of

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.774
these four pixels and color them all in that color. And this is, I'm making

00:00:38.774 --> 00:00:42.971
every pixel a bit fatter. Let me blow this up a little. So here are the pixel,

00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:47.311
and I want to know, what are it's three neighbors to the right, to the bottom,

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:53.613
and diagonally. So let's assume the one that I'm starting with is pixels ij,

00:00:53.613 --> 00:01:00.630
that means my row is i, and my column is j. Let's look at the one to the right.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.068
The row number is the same, and the column number has increased by one. So here

00:01:06.068 --> 00:01:12.660
it is in Java. Same row, column increased by one. What about the one to the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.328
south? In this case, the column index j is the same. And the row index has

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:24.508
increased by one. So here's the java code for that. Finally, the diagonal one

00:01:24.508 --> 00:01:30.716
has both the row and column index increase by one. And I'll leave it to you in

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:35.389
the next lab exercise to figure that out. So go ahead and. Program this

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:40.536
exercise. You need to traverse the first pixel here then you jump by two each

00:01:40.536 --> 00:01:47.340
time and also the columns you go down by two columns each time. In each step

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.630
you average these four pixels, compute the average value and stick it back into

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.987
all four pixels. Don't worry the friendly

00:01:54.987 --> 00:01:55.614
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.149
have given you some code to start with.
