00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.606
In this lesson, we've talked a lot about 
different things that functions can do,

00:00:03.606 --> 00:00:07.605
especially different ways that we can 
combine them with one another.

00:00:07.605 --> 00:00:11.814
Let's pretend like we have these two 
functions: f of x equals x cubed, and g

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:16.708
of x equals x minus 2. 
We saw that we can combine these through

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:21.920
addition by taking f plus g of x. 
We could also combine these through

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.810
subtraction, we could either have f minus 
g of x, or we could have g minus f of x.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.120
These give us two different things, or at 
least in this case they do.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.180
We can multiply them to give us fg of x. 
We also found out that we could divide them.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.605
We could find f over g of x. 
Or g over f of x.

00:00:41.605 --> 00:00:46.489
In all these situations, we just take the 
outputs of each function, and combine

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.160
them in the way specified. 
The other important concept that we

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.310
introduced in this lesson was the idea of 
compositions of functions.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.890
This means using the output of one 
function as the input for another function.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.850
If we want f composed with g of x, that's 
the same as asking for f of g of x.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.010
Which means, that we use the output of g, 
as the input of f.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.080
In this case, that would give us, x minus 
2 cubed.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.440
We can switch things around and go the 
other direction too, looking for g

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.802
composed with f instead. 
That means we're looking for g of f of x,

00:01:22.802 --> 00:01:27.310
which in this case, will give us, x cubed 
minus 2.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.782
We saw that in many cases, like our 
showering and getting dressed example,

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:34.310
switching the order of composition of 
functions produces a very different

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.140
outcome, a very different output for the 
composite function.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.798
Remember, getting dressed and then 
showering is not the same as showering

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:46.246
and then getting dressed. 
I hope you enjoyed expanding your

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:48.962
understanding of functions and how they 
can work together.

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:50.422
Great job.
