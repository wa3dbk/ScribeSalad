00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Unfortunately, we got the wrong answer.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Yes, we got a path that leads to the goal, but we didn't get the fastest path.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's see what went wrong.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We had our start state, and then we started expanding that and moving out.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
That defined our frontier.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Then we were very careful about sorting the elements on the frontier,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and then we pulled off the very best, the one with the least cost.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Then expanded out from there.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Let's say the cost of getting to the end of this path with 14, this one 15, this one 16.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is the lowest cost path, we expand that first.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's say one of the steps cost 5, so that gets us to this state with a cost of 19.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's say that is in fact a goal state.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now we just stopped there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We said we took off the least cost path. We expanded it. We found a goal. We're done.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
When we were looking for the shortest path in terms of the least number of steps,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that was the right approach,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but when we're looking for the least cost path, that's not the right approach.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Because even though we pulled off the cheapest path here--the one with the lowerst cost--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
here's another path that has a higher cost,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but if we expand that there might be a step that only costs 2.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We get to this state with cost 17 and that's also a goal.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So we made a mistake. We stopped here when we got this result that was 19

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when we really wanted this result that was 17.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I think the problem was we were prematurely acting.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We said just because this was the fastest solution here,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
we went ahead and took one step away from the fastest

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and accepted that when that might not be the best answer overall.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
How can we fix this? One possibility would be to exhaust the frontier.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That is, we've got a frontier here.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Even though we find a solution from the first element of the frontier,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we keep going until we visit everybody on the frontier

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and give everybody a change to find the better solution.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Another possibility is to give everybody one more chance.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Once we've found the first solution, now we say,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
okay, everybody on the frontier gets one more step to see if they can find a solution.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The third possibility would be to test later.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That is, when we generate this solution, we don't check right here to see if it is a solution.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Rather, we just go ahead and throw this onto the frontier

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and only check to see if it's a solution when we pull the next element off of the frontier.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Rather than when we generate a new node and we're about to add them,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
do the checks later once we've pulled them off the frontier.

00:02:46.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now tell me which, if any, of these will work to give us this fastest solution.
