Our need to belong is one of the strongest of the human needs. However,

00:00:03.748 --> 00:00:07.634
unfortunately, there are times when we're rejected. Rejection can lead to a

00:00:07.634 --> 00:00:11.386
variety of negative consequences, including loneliness, isolation, and even

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:12.540
pain.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.855
[NOISE]

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.780
Now this is a perfect time to bring up bullying, and the negative consequences

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.555
of bullying. When a person's bullied, he or she is rejected and often ridiculed

00:00:20.555 --> 00:00:25.452
by others. Rejection can be overwhelming and actually cause pain for the

00:00:25.452 --> 00:00:29.310
person. Do you remember in the sensation and perception lesson when we talked

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.210
about social pain activating the exact same part of the brain as physical pain?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.824
So when people say being rejected hurts, it really is painful. Some of the

00:00:38.824 --> 00:00:42.464
other problems associated with rejection are eating disorders, more health

00:00:42.464 --> 00:00:46.400
problems, depression, and, tragically, sometimes suicide.
