00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.270
The reason our image is
not showing up immediately

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.120
has to do with the fact that our code
is being executed in the background.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.335
Now, I know what you may be thinking,
what's the background?

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:13.230
Why's our code there, and
how does this affect my app?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.980
Don't panic.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.470
Without getting into the details,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.300
we're going to use a method
that fixes this problem.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.690
The method we'll use will take any
updates that we're making to the UI,

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.950
like displaying our image, and
then run them in the foreground, or

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.820
the main executing environment.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.120
Let's see this now.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.100
Back in our project,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.880
we've been provided with a special
function called performUIUpdatesOnMain.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.650
This function is defined on
the GCDBlackBox Swift file.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.220
Now the reason we use the term blackbox
in the name of that Swift file

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.040
is because a blackbox refers to
something you can use without

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.130
knowing the internal details.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.045
So for the purposes of this course,
you can use the function to

00:00:49.045 --> 00:00:52.870
performUIUpdatesOnMain without
knowing how it's implemented.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.780
You should just call this function
anytime you need to make updates to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.340
the UI inside of the completion
handler of a network task.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.880
Now, looking at this method,
we can see that it takes a closure

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.760
that has no parameters, and
returns void or nothing.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.880
And since the closure
is the only parameter,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.660
we can use the trailing closure syntax.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.710
All we need to do is just
relocate any code responsible for

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.740
updating the UI, and
place it inside this closure.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.504
So in our case it's just
this line of code here.

00:01:27.288 --> 00:01:28.211
Now let's run the project.

00:01:35.674 --> 00:01:37.450
Nice, there we go.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.060
That's what we want.
