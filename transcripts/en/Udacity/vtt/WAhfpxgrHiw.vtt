00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.820
Now that we have already seen how to split the data,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.320
we will do some data cleaning.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.300
Remember we have already decided that the location can be

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.840
represented as the distance from a point of reference.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.730
We will go into depth a little bit later.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.830
As to which distance function among these three might work best.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.470
We will also need to decide on the times when we calculate these distances.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.230
The distances at each time is a feature in our model.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.860
We will also need to decide at what time intervals we choose these distances,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.380
so that we can have adequate number of features.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.760
We have now switched to the iPython Notebook again.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.310
We're going to run the code to clean the data.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.500
The code in block five takes the date and time, combines it into one

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.200
timestamp quantity, and makes the value reflective of US specific time.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.400
It also makes sure that if some values of date or time is absent or

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.550
is equals, equals none those data points are not used in the analysis.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.400
So let us run the code again by pressing the play buttons.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.535
After you have finished running through lines six, seven, and

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:23.500
eight you will see an output.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.060
The output has 128,520 entries.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:37.480
This is down from 128,561 entries we started with.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.950
The reduced number of events is a result of cleaning the data.
