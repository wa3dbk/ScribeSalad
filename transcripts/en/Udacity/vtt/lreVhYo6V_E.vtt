00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.838
So how'd you do remembering that grocery list? Well, if you're like many

00:00:03.838 --> 00:00:07.006
people, you might have remembered the very beginning or perhaps the very end of

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:12.020
the list. This is not uncommon and psychologists actually have a term for why

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.540
we tend to remember things at the beginning and things at the end, but perhaps

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.007
not the middle of a list. This is called Serial Position Effect. This is our

00:00:22.007 --> 00:00:25.293
tendency to have better recall for the things that are at the beginning of a

00:00:25.293 --> 00:00:31.390
list or at the end of a list, because of their particular position on the list.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.792
The ability to remember things at the beginning of a list, is called primacy

00:00:34.792 --> 00:00:39.468
effect. On the other hand, the ability to recall items at the end of a list, is

00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:43.879
called recency effect. So, you may think, why is it important whether I

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.172
remember things at the beginning of my list, or at the end of my list. Well

00:00:48.172 --> 00:00:52.636
just be aware of the serial positioning effect may have particular value. One

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:56.068
thing Susan always tells her students is that serial positioning effect can be

00:00:56.068 --> 00:01:00.518
a strategy for studying. It's always a good idea to make flash cards. Put a

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:04.980
term you're trying to remember on one side of the flash card. And a definition

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.820
or an example on the other side of the flash card. There's two ways to study.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.525
One is to begin by looking at the term you're trying to remember the definition

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:16.887
or the example for. The other is to flip it around and read the definition and

00:01:16.887 --> 00:01:19.680
the example and try to remember the term.
