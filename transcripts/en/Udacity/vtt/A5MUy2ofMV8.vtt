Now this is a good example of what we learned in lesson one, that different

00:00:03.123 --> 00:00:06.489
psychologists have different view points or perspectives in terms of how they

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:12.050
explain behavior and sometimes they're very passionate about those view points.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.534
Now throughout the course we discuss the importance about nature and nurture in

00:00:15.534 --> 00:00:19.668
learning. And it's also important to hear when we're looking at how we learn to

00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:25.079
comprehend and to produce language. The social cultural theory of language

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.300
suggests that things such as schooling, our peers, birth order, socioeconomic

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.797
status and our parents all contribute to our language development. And we know

00:00:35.797 --> 00:00:38.506
that imitation is important and you should remember that from the lesson on

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:43.090
learning. An interesting example of imitation, did you know that infants as

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.470
young as 50 minutes old will open their mouths and stick out their tongues when

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.420
they see adults do. That's pretty powerful.
