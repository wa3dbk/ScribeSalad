00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.710
The greedy approach leads to what is called a meta-server

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.810
overload. Let's understand how that happens. Let's say that

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.080
there's a whole bunch of users that are generating content, and

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.310
one guy generates a content with a key of 149, another guy Generates a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.220
content with a key 148, 152, 153 and so on and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950
now what they want to do is they want to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.910
place this key value pair this guy's node ID is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.050
80. This guy's node ID is something else. Something else

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.310
something else and all these guys want to keep the

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.340
key value pair and what will they do in terms

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.110
of this greedy algorithm well they'll try to find a

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.050
node whose id is closest to the key that they

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.240
want to place. Well it turns out that 150 is

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.820
the closest. ID corresponding to all of these

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.860
keys that we're talking about here, so all of

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.970
these puts will result in going to one node, namely the node ID 150, in terms of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.500
the put operation. And, first of all there's

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.012
going to be congestion here if a lot of.

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:13.760
Content hashed to a key that are so closely

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.560
together they all end up in the same node

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.780
ID 150. Remember that the actual content is

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.130
with the putter of this key value pair,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.490
namely node 80. And, similarly, the content Is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.370
with this putter, content with this putter. What

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.000
this guy is storing is the metadata that

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.590
allows everybody to discover the content provider. So

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:42.040
not only is this node going to find a lot of traffic if lots of keys map

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.410
to its node ID, also the nodes that are adjacent to this node In the overlay

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.350
network, they are going to be affected also.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.460
Everybody is trying to reach this guy so you

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.690
can see that as we go towards this,

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.780
there's sort of a presaturation effect that's going

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.980
on. The tree is rooted at this destination

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.530
node, and the nodes that are in close proximity,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.250
the intermediate nodes in the overlay network

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.310
space They get congested, and so on. And

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.990
that is what is sometimes referred to as a desaturation problem. Now this is for

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.990
the putters. Further, if my content whose

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.630
key value is toward here, the video that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.070
I generated from my India trip. If that

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.830
gets hot, and everybody wants to Find out

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.480
how to achieve that particular video 149. They're

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.300
all going to make get calls. And these

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.020
get calls again end up with this same

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.800
metadata server, because that's the guy that is

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.670
storing my key value pair 149, 80. And so all these gets saying that I want to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.180
get 149, I want to get 149, I want to get 149. All of them. Go to the same

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.680
node ID 150. Again there is congestion at the meta data so it can happen either

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.630
because some content is so popular that everybody

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.880
that wants to discover the content provider they

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.810
have only the key and they have to go to the metadata server to find out

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.940
the content provider So that results in this

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.370
congestion, which is the metadata server overload problem.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.080
And the combination of these puts and gets result in what I

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.210
called the tree saturation problem, the tree being rooted at the congested node

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.610
and affecting all the nearby nodes In the overlay network because they

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.910
are the gateway to get this node that contains this particular key value pair.
