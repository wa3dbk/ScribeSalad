00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Carson] If we treat an encryption function--as the one in GSM--as something

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that takes a message, produces an encrypted message,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and it consumes a key to perform that.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There are different ways in which you can make this resistant against time-memory trails.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Three different mitigations.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
First, you can make the message unpredictable.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sounds obvious. Why would you encrypt something predictable?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But a lot of systems do just encrypt a whole stream of data,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
some of which is encrypted. Something is worth protecting. GSM mixes the two.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Dave] All of these attacks you know some--because of the GSM protocol--

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
there are some messages that are very easy to guess. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [Carson] Exactly.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
[Dave] And you know what they are and can you those in this attack.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To exchange a text message, for instance, between the base station and your phone,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
somewhere between 20 and 40 messages are exchanged,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
only one of which has the actual text message content.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Another one may have some unpredictable set of information.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
All the rest is just management information--encrypted though--

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and that management information is usually--

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[Dave] Does it make sense as one solution to not encrypt the management information.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Carson] Clear, yeah. There's a standard extension that suggests exactly that.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But basically the whole ecosystem would have to change to accommodate for that.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Currently, it's just the encryption is switched on at some point

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and everything thereafter is encrypted, be it predictable or not.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
There are measures, though, to make predictable messages more randomized

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to create some wiggle room for how you send a message.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That's currently being deployed--not in all networks, though.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I've not seen--one of the two American networks I don't think has it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You need to know the base station is understanding if you change the protocol like that.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The base station would have to change to go all the way of making all messages unpredictable,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but even changing the base station controllers, bigger installations

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that control dozens of base stations that control dozens of base stations

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
would do the job, and those are usually software updateable,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because they have to accommodate for usually faster connections all the time.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Now, more secure connections that could that, too, hasn't been seen too much yet.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We do track that on gsmmap.org.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The second way, of course, of making this system uncorrectable

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is to decrease the key size sufficiently so that none of these tradeoffs

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
leads to practical values anymore.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That is used, for instance, in 3G and 4G networks most of the time.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Then a third way of protecting against these types of attacks that assume,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
if you predict a message you have a direct mapping between message out and key,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is to introduce an auxiliary input.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It's usually called either a "nonce" for random number or initialization vector.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
GSM, in fact, does have an initialization vector,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
so you would think that it breaks the correlation between key and message.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Now you'd have to compute your table separately for every nonce.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
This is sort of like adding SALT to passwords.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Exactly. This is the exact same system as adding SALT.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This has been included in GSM.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.000
However, the nonce is only effective if the attacker has to go for the key

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
to break the system.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
There are different encryption functions that are attackable

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
with time-memory trade-offs in different ways,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in particular for block ciphers.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
This protection measure works out of the box,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
because the block cipher consumes the key, crunches it in complex ways

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and outputs the message.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Unlike those, stream ciphers take the key, do once more computation,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
do the same computation again, do the same computation again--

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
in the case of GSM 100 times--and then outputs the message.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
It becomes a function that's consistent over very many smaller functions

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and the nonce is, of course, only input at the very beginning.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
To make this now resistant against time-memory tradeoff

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
their intermediate states--those results of the first round, second round, and so forth

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to the 100th round--have to be a non-attackable time-memory tradeoff.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
That sometimes is achieved by a large, internal state of the function.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:46.000
For instance, the GPRS functions or etch function--2.5G networks--

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
they also consume a 64-bit key,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
but they have an internal state of at least 96 bits.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
That is a protection, because now the attacker has to go for the key after all.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.000
However, if you use a small internal state, then the attacker can go to attack

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that internal state and GSM falls exactly in this category,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and then the countermeasure doesn't work anymore.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So the internal state is still 64 bits. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Exactly. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Combining the key and the nonce.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Yeah. Message in, the key, and the message out as well as the internal state--

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
everything is 64 bits in GSM.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Of course, adding a large internal state doesn't come at a great cost.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It takes a few more flipflops and hyper-implementation or slightly larger words

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in the software implementation.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This didn't prevent the attack that you described,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
but the attack you showed us would actually be better than this.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
To do the n lookups would have taken hours.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You were able to show it working in a manner of seconds or minutes.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
To explain why JSM is more vulnerable, we have to go a little bit into this discussion

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
we started earlier on the hundred little functions instead of one big function--

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
what makes this a stream cipher.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This stream cipher consumes in the beginning both a key and IV, as we've seen,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:18.000
but does a computation 100 times to produce an internal state

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that is then mapped onto the output that's then XORed

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
with the message is basically the output message.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Interesting is this part, though.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Each of these links is such a small computation

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that you can easily reverse it.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It is nonlinear, meaning you cannot really reverse it without 100% certainty,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
but it's such a small computation that you can just kind of brute force the input space.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
[Dave] Okay. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;[Carson] Right? So little--

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
[Carson] But the input space is small.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
[Carson] Yeah, just a few bits change in each of these steps,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
so you can just go through all the possibilities of input space and see which ones

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
map back to your output. Right?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Now, you may end up with several, so it's not always that only one of the inputs

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
would have produced. That's exactly the nonlinear property.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
However, this may look as a complication at first

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but does, in fact, help the hacker because each of these also generates

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
a key for some given IV that you assume.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Well, at least some. Some may be dead ends.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:48.000
But at least in a lot of cases you can track one point that you store in your table

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
back to different keys. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;[Dave] I see.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Different starting key IV pairs lead to the same output.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Exactly, and on average, for each value that you store in the table

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
you have 13 keys that you find every time.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Only one of them will be the correct one.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Sometimes even all 13 are wrong. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;[Dave] I see.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
[Carson] But if you do find a key it will just be one of them.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:20.000
However, storing this point in the table is equivalent to storing 13 points in this table.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
[Dave] Right, and now each lookup is the equivalent of doing 13 lookups.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Carson] No, the lookup is actually the same effort, but the storage is decreased.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
This is basically an inherit encryption function for rainbow tables

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that this system comes with.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
We are 13 times more efficient with this encryption function

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
than with a generic 64-bit encryption function.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Thirteen times and such a tradeoff with all the different tweaks

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
is the difference between hours and seconds.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
[Dave] You're shrinking the table by a factor of 10,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
which is making all the lookups less expensive. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;[Carson] Exactly.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Basically we're having 13 times more storage, and the crate of storage is quadratic.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
We're more efficient as an approximation by this factor,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and that's the difference between seconds and hours.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
That's why SMS can be snooped in seconds.
