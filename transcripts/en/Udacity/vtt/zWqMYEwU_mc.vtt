00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.530
The structural models that we have been looking at so far express properties of

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.620
systems that are true at all times. Although, these models are general,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.950
they fail to convey interesting behavioral aspects of the systems.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.300
That is how the systems respond to external stimuli. UML provides a variety

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.960
of alternative diagrams that do support the behavioral modeling of systems.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.330
We will look at these and later we will also go into detail on the state chart

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.870
diagramming technique. Which is the one which provides you the ability to.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.250
Precisely describe the system properties.
