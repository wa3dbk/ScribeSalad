00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.114
So for the quiz, your goal is to define a nextDay procedure that takes as input

00:00:04.114 --> 00:00:08.079
a valid data in the Gregorian calendar, which is encoded as three numbers, the

00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:11.983
year, the month and the day and then returns the next day as a threetuple of the

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:17.022
year, the month and the day. And to keep this simple, you should assume that all

00:00:17.022 --> 00:00:21.317
months have 30 days. This of course will not be correct in some cases, but will

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:23.593
be a good start towards solving the problem.
