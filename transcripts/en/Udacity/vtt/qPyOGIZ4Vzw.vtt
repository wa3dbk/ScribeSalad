00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.810
Okay. So we have dispatch instruction in ROB5.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.400
It's value that it will produce is minus 1.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.100
That value will be broadcast in cycle seven because it begin executed at six.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:18.250
But before we get to that in cycle six we are going to issue this instruction.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.310
In cycle six we have finished our multiplication here.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.328
It was executing in cycles three, four, and five. Took three cycles. So

00:00:26.328 --> 00:00:30.770
in cycle six it also broadcast the result. So the result of the multiplication

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.300
is broadcast as an eight under the name of ROB2 and this is marked as done.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.660
ROB2 value is captured. This 8 is going to be captured here, because we

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.250
were waiting for ROB2. Here we are not waiting for ROB2 so everything is fine.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.820
In cycle seven, the ROB5 instruction, broadcast the result of minus 1.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.370
This minus 1 gets captured here because it matches this. And this instruction is

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.110
done. In cycle seven, as we have seen, we have written this result, captured it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.610
here, we have marked this instruction as done, we have nothing left to issue. So

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.730
the question for you is in what cycle do we dispatch this instruction.
