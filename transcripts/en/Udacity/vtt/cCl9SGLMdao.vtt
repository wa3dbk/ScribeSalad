00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.070
We've helped you focus on you, and

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.850
the message that you convey
into your professional network.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.730
But what about actually
building a LinkedIn network?

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.240
This is where all of your hard
work comes into fruition.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.470
It's time to get connected with others.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.880
Why connect?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.660
Networking is important.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.420
Having a connection can actually be
even more powerful than your skills or

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.580
expertise once you have a network, you
might be able to find a connection at

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.940
a company you want to work for, and more
people will be aware of your job hunt.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.760
Who should you connect with?

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.080
Connect with people who like you and
who know how you work.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.310
Don't connect with someone you've never
met and found via search on LinkedIn and

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.930
don't be spamming.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
The connections section can also be
a great place for recommendations.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.060
But be selective on who you
asked to recommend you.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.180
Reach out to people who are intimately
aware of the work you've done and

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.540
who can speak specifically
about how you contributed.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.830
But don't call for too many.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.860
One recommendation per major
work experience is fine.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.420
If you have five recommendations for

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.260
one job, it can look like you
are twisting their arms to write them.
