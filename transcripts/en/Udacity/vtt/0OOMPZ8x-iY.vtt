Aha, so this situation keeps becoming more complicated David.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.435
Let's think about what might happen if the manager of

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:15.056
the Arizona Diamondbacks anticipated what the Atlanta Braves pitcher would do,

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:20.120
and actually change the batter so the batter now is left handed?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.580
If the batter is left handed, then the percept is slightly different.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.360
The content of the pitcher's working memory is slightly different.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.610
The production rules capturing the pursuit of knowledge are still the same. What

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.330
do you think will happen now? What kind of decision will the pitcher make now?
