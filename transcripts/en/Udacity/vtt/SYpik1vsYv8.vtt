00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
And there's two answers that are correct here--namely, the first two ones.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.170
So the error actually comes from the rounding because as we discussed before--

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.650
if we did not round, then the table size will be changed and also the solution that we get.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.160
So the objects that we picked wouldn't change, but through these rounding down here,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.540
what can happen is that two objects that actually have a different value

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.700
now appear to the algorithm to have the same value.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.180
So the algorithm say of objects V₁ and V₂ and we're going to do an example here to say--

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:36.660
V₁ has a value of 8 and V₂ has a value of 9, and we're now choosing this x here to be 2,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.150
then V₁ gets the scale down value of 4 and V₂ gets the scale value of 4.5.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.830
Now, assuming that both objects have the same size, it would be better to take V₂ instead of V₁,

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.160
but now if we round down, both objects get a scales down value of 4,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.730
so the algorithm might pick V₁ over V₂, although that is sub-optimal, but the algorithm

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.550
can't tell anymore because both objects in terms of value look the same to the algorithm.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.050
The cool thing is that we can actually specify and quantify how large that error is going to be.

00:01:09.050 --> 99:59:59.000
So this is not right. We can't specify it and this is exactly what we are now going to do.
