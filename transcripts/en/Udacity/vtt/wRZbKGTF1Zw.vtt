00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And so we're in the last piece in detail is what gain are you creating.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What are the benefits the customer expects, desires or surprise about.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So again you're going to start with your hypothesis--"What makes the customer happy,"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
or is that you're going to create savings and time or money and effort.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Is this a product that delights them because the outcome is better than you could even imagine,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
better quality, or more of something or less of something they're going to like.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Does it just simply outperform current solutions that delighted customer.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Does it make your job or life easier, or does it create positive consequences

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that a customer desires.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Again, it could be a social consequence for a need or it could be a business consequence--

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
they get more sales, etc.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And so much like thinking through pain, you'll start with a set of hypothesis,

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but the only way to understand this is outside the building in front of lots of customers.
