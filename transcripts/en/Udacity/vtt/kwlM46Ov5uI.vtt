00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through a possible answer together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Here I've written out a candidate example.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's image that "bell hooks" is p and "curer bell" is q.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The first thing we're going to do is find the index into p of the first space.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Pindex space 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This'll be 4 in our running example.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Qindex--the location of this space in q might be different--0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In fact in our example it is.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now what I want to do is select out the first word in p.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I want everything from the beginning all the way up to, but not including, the space.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This selection goes to the left as far as it can but does not include pindex,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
so it will be "bell."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I could also have put a 0 in here. That would have been exactly the same.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
For q I don't want to start at position 5.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I actually want to start at position 6, starting with the b and going to the end of the word.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This is q's second word, which in our running example is also bell,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
since bell equals bell, we'll just return True.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.173
Curer Bell was actually a pseudonym, a false name, adopted by Charlotte Bronte, an author.
