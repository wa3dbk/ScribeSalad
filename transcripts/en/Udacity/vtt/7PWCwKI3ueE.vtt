00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right. Now that you know the trick, let's see if you can decode a message yourself.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Here's the message after it's been altered by the spy--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the 15-bit code that you see in front of you.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What I want you to do is figure out what message the spy was trying to send

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and type it into the box below.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Now, the message itself is in binary,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
but just type the digits--the bits in--the four bits.
