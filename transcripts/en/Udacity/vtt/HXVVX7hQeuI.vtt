00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.568
As a refresher, I'm showing you the

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:06.500
seven layer OSI reference model of the protocol

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.290
stack. Now, load management, as I mentioned, for

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.030
dealing with client requests, can be done at

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.700
any of the levels of the seven layer OSI model. From the network layer and

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.650
up. And higher the layer, you have more

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.470
functionality that you can associate with the load

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.960
manager in the terms of, how it deals with the

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.710
server failures, how it deals with directing incoming client requests

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.170
to the different servers, all of these are possible, the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.980
higher the layer at which you construct the load manager.
