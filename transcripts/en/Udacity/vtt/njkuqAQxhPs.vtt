00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.648
Here the correct answer is negative 9. Great work if you found this answer. If

00:00:04.648 --> 00:00:08.822
you were a little stumped, that's okay. Let's see how to solve it. We want to

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:13.945
cube both sides of the equation, since a 3 is our index. A 3rd power will undo

00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:19.800
a cube root. So we'll have x plus 1 on the left, and negative 8 on the right.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.286
We need to make sure we cube this number as well, since we cubed this side. So

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:29.900
negative 2 times negative 2 times negative 2 equals negative 8. Finally, we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.456
subtract 1 from both sides, to get 1x equals negative 9. Before we finalize

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:38.650
this as our answer, we need to make sure we check it in the original equation.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.422
So I'll take negative 9 and substitute it in for x. This cube root only covers

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:49.020
x plus 1. This means I only need to take the cube root of this expression, and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.810
then add 5. So we'll have the cube root of negative 8, then we'll add 5 and see

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.362
if that equals 3. The cube root of negative 8 is negative 2, since negative 2

00:00:58.362 --> 00:01:03.930
multiplied itself three times gives us negative 8. And finally, when we add

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.160
here, our solution checks. In general when we solve, we want to keep in mind to

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.698
isolate the radical first, then to raise both sides of the equation by the

00:01:11.698 --> 00:01:16.563
index of the root. And finally, once we have an answer, you want to check it to

00:01:16.563 --> 00:01:18.280
be sure we're correct.
