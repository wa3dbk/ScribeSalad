Open the spreadsheet for the data for miles traveled versus cost of various

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.920
flights. Try and make this scatter plot yourself within the Google doc. You

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.820
don't have to, but it's probably good to know how to do, then calculate R.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.970
Remember that the function in Google doc is Pearson, and then you'll enter the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.420
name of the start cell for the x variables. Go all the way to the end cell for

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.450
the x variables. Comma, start cell for the y variables, colon, end cell for the

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.430
y variables. After you get this, enter the correlation coefficient here, round

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.443
to two decimal places.
