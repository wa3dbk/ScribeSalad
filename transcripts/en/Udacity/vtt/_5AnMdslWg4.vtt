00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.400
Okay, great. Let's do a quiz having to do with

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.960
data consistency. Now in this case, we're going to look at

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.410
stock symbols for three different companies over a period of

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.010
several years. This is an example drawn from the Bad Data

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.170
Handbook. Spencer Burns, in his chapter, When Data and Reality

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.700
Don't Match, tells this story having to do with unique identifiers

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.820
for a few different companies that are publicly traded. So for

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.760
most of the 20th century, stock symbols for Kmart and Sears

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.110
were KM and S, respectively. Sprint also, during the time

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.520
it was a company during the 20th century, had the stock

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.600
symbol, FON, or FON. So now, let's take a look at

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.090
what happened with regard to these unique identifiers for companies as

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.410
we move forward in time. And, what I want you

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.780
to think about is; what type of challenges might this present

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.300
to us from a consistency standpoint, and thinking about auditing data

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.400
and cleaning data. So, in 2002, Kmart filed for bankruptcy and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.320
was then delisted as a stock. In 2003, they recovered from bankruptcy,

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.908
were relisted, but this time with the stock symbol KMRT. In 2005,

00:01:00.908 --> 00:01:05.968
Kmart and Sears merged and so all former shares of Kmart

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:12.030
became SHLD, or Sears Holdings, as did Sears stock.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.979
And then later that year, Sprint changed its stock symbol

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.210
from FON to S. So, over a period of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.650
several years, three different companies were uniquely identified by

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.140
five different stock symbols. And in fact, two companies

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.850
were, depending on which point in time you're talking

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.040
about, uniquely identified by the same stock symbol. Now

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.910
when we talk about these being unique identifiers, we

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.410
should really be using air quotes. It's this kind

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.980
of problem that we'll often face, when we are looking

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.930
at data collected from different points in time.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.500
The identifiers for specific entities have a tendency to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.830
change. Now this type of data is actually

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.950
fairly difficult to find. So, in this quiz what

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.580
we're going to do is look at something

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.035
similar, having to do with when countries joined the

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:02.370
eurozone and what that means for what currency

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.720
they were using at a given point in time.
