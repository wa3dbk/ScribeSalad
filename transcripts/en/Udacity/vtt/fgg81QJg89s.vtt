00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.650
Now calculate the t critical value so that we can conduct a t test at alpha

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.462
equals 0.05. Remember that this is a two tailed test due to what we chose for

00:00:09.462 --> 00:00:15.054
our alternative hypothesis. Based on this t critical value and the t statistic

00:00:15.054 --> 00:00:19.360
you calculated do we accept the null or reject the null?
