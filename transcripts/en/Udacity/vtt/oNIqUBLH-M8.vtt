00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.240
Your favorite shoe company now only has 200 pairs of shoes in stock. Shoes are

00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:08.635
selling fast because of the sale. If the company increases its shoe inventory by

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:13.250
25%, how many pairs of shoes will the company have? So the company is going to

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:17.250
be running out of shoes. If the company doesn't get any new pairs of shoes,

00:00:17.592 --> 00:00:22.566
they'll have a 100% of their inventory. Their current inventory is 200, so

00:00:22.578 --> 00:00:27.550
they'd have a 100% of 200. I know that as a decimal, a 100% is just 1. I divide

00:00:27.562 --> 00:00:32.585
by a 100 and move the decimal place left, so, I have 1 times 200. The company

00:00:32.597 --> 00:00:37.697
doesn't want this. If they just have 100% of the shoes, the inventory won't

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:42.410
change and they'll run out of shoes. So, in the last problem, we had to decrease

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:46.385
our percentage, because we had a percent off, but this time the company wants to

00:00:46.397 --> 00:00:50.255
increase their percentage. Let's see if you can figure out what percentage of

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:52.460
the pairs of shoes you actually want to find.
