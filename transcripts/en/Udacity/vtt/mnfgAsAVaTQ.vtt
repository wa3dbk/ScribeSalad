00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.618
Correct answer is 0.21 or 21%. Remember that R squared is given by this

00:00:07.618 --> 00:00:13.125
formula. So for our purposes, remember that t was 2.5 negative. So we take our

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.814
negative 2.5. We're going to square it here. We'll square it here, and then add

00:00:16.814 --> 00:00:21.652
the 24, and then divide. So we end up with 6.25 divided by 30.25, which gives

00:00:21.652 --> 00:00:26.825
us 0.21, again rounded to two decimal places. This tells us that the

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:30.353
differences in food prices for the sample of 25 people, 21% of those

00:00:30.353 --> 00:00:34.559
differences are due to the cost saving program.
