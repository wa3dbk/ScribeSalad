00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.220
So similar to what we saw in the data binding,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.650
we can have D3 objects which exist in our JavaScript scope, but it is not until

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.610
we actually choose to select some elements on the page, either HTML or SVG.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.890
And append something to them which has some visual representation that

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.230
the actual axis objects themselves get rendered as SVG.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.010
In this case we first select the SVG which contains our chart,

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.400
we append a group in this case SVG g-element.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.970
And again you can think of this analogous to a div tag in HTML, simply a way to

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.890
group other SVG elements which doesn't have intrinsic visual display itself.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.580
So think of a group in SVG.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.530
As some invisible fence around a bunch of other SVG objects.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.170
We add a class to it.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.610
Actually two classes.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.430
Both class x and class axis.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.020
And then, change the transform attribute on the group

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.525
to move everything contained within the group,

00:01:04.525 --> 00:01:09.510
zero pixels in the x direction, and height pixels in the y direction.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.100
Since SVG has an inverse coordinate space by translating rg we

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.420
move it zero in the x and

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.790
height in the y which corresponds to the bottom of our chart in this case.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.930
And for the y-axis we do the same.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.700
This time, instead of giving it the classes, both x and

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.280
axis, we give it the class y and axis.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.430
Notice that the axis class is common between the two.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.680
This allows us to apply CSS selectors to both the x and y axis.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.010
But since we also attached a separate x class and a separate y class

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.960
we can then further specialize the x and the y styling independently.
