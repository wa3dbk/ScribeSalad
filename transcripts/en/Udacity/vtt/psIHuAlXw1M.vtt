00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.880
Awesome job.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.250
You've uncovered a simple but

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.770
powerful technique to make your pages faster and easier.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.540
And along the way, you've made a portfolio that you can share with everybody.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.010
&gt;&gt; However, sometimes you need to use more complex styles and features.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.230
Now, luckily you don't need to build these complex frameworks on your own.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.970
There are many full featured frameworks available for use on the web.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.580
You just have to choose one and learn how to use it.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like Twitter's popular Bootstrap framework.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.020
In the next lesson,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.700
I'll help you take advantage of Bootstrap to make your pages professional.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.280
Let's get started.
