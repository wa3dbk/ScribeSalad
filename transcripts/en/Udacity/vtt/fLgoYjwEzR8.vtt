We know one way to articulate what we do to find the slope of a line, but there

00:00:04.207 --> 00:00:08.495
are definitely other ways that we can think about this as well. Please pick the

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.775
best one of these choices. When we try to find the slope of a line, do we divide

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:17.015
the x coordinate by the y coordinate, divide the increase in x by the increase

00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:21.330
in y, divide the increase in y by the increase in x, or multiply the increase in

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:22.500
y by the increase in x?
