What we eat is clearly not just based on biological influence, but culture

00:00:04.528 --> 00:00:09.708
plays a factor as well. The psychology of what we eat has to do with external

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:13.800
factors, such as the sight of food, the smell of food, and importantly, the

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.655
culture in which we were raised. That is, when one person may find delicious,

00:00:19.655 --> 00:00:24.420
another person may find inedible. Children, for example, who are exposed to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.016
spicy foods early in life quickly develop a taste and even cravings for the

00:00:28.016 --> 00:00:34.086
spicy foods later in life. Likewise, people who were not exposed to spicy foods

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:39.856
find them too overpowering for them. Similarly, brains and intestines are

00:00:39.856 --> 00:00:45.610
delicious in some cultures. Yet beef is disgusting, or even sacrilegious in

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.680
others. In most cases, except for sweets, food preferences are acquired, and

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.978
learned tastes. It's safe to say that food and cuisine are key traits of any

00:00:55.978 --> 00:01:00.890
culture, with each culture having it's own unique cuisine and food.
