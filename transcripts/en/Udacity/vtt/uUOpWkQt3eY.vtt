00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.040
So what would be a piece of
information that if we knew it,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.490
would make it relatively straightforward
to figure out what new state we were in?

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.600
&gt;&gt; Well if we knew what state we were
in before, since we have a transition

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.180
model we know which states
we are likely to be in next.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah okay, let's just write that.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:18.840
That's a that's a really good start.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.920
So what we're saying is,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.680
let's break things down by
the possible state that we started in.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.880
And what we want to know and
we're going to weight things by,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.830
what's the probability that
that's the state we started in?

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.340
Given B A Z.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.630
Then given that, what's the probability
of the next state given that state?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.320
So this is going to help us
break things down, successfully.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.340
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.130
So what do we know about
the probability of being in a state,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.950
given a belief state that we took
an action and we made some observation?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.400
So I think the thing to point out here
is that the observation that we saw

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.650
is generated by the state
that we ended up in.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.250
And so we're actually trying to figure
out what state we are in, basing

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.080
observation we got, when, in fact,
the generative model goes the other way.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.772
So this is a prime situation
to try to use Bayes' Rule.

00:01:08.772 --> 00:01:11.100
&gt;&gt; Prime.
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It's an s prime situation for

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.830
using Bayes' Rule.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.180
So that gives us the probability of
making an observation, given the state

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.920
that we're in, or that we arrived in s
prime and carrying over the a and the s.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.320
And the probability that that's
the state we ended in, given a and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.270
s, divided by the normalization factor.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.910
The probability of the observation,
given a and s.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.880
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.040
So now we're getting really close
to quantities that we recognize.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.410
In particular, the probability of an
observation given the state that we just

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.660
landed in is independent of the action
and the state that we just talked.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.900
So this is going to be
the observation function.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.590
This right here is the transition
function the probability of landing in

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.510
some state as prime given that we
were in state S and took action A.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.980
And then this is just going to be
a normalization factor at the bottom.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.360
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So substituting those quantities in

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.330
and rewriting out this
normalization factors is basically

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.360
the numerator divided by the sum of
all the possible next eight s prime.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.800
We get one component of the new police
state be prime if we apply the same idea

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.639
over all possible states as prime.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.750
Then we get a probability distribution
over all the states that represents

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.590
the likelihood of being in those states
given that we In belief state b,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.760
took action a, and made observation z.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.570
&gt;&gt; So that's intuitively obvious,
even to the most casual observer.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.045
But more importantly, it just uses
all the quantities we already had.

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.940
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] It does, it seems like
sort of when a TV series is over and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.040
they bring all the characters back for
one last show.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.960
It's like we've got to B back,
and the O back, and the Z back.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.550
Everybody is friends again.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.235
&gt;&gt; And it spells bOT.

00:02:41.235 --> 00:02:43.470
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] And it spells bOT.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.560
So my point is that these quantities
can be easily calculated from.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.560
Or sorry, this quantity, this b prime
s prime can be easily calculated from

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.010
quantities that we have lying around
because we have the model, the POMDP.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.800
And we know what the previous
belief state is and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.820
we know what action we just took and
what observation we made.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.560
And so all this can be updated.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.220
And so we can keep track of
this notion of where we are.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.410
This belief state notion
of the belief MDP.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.700
&gt;&gt; I like it.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.610
&gt;&gt; Cool.
All right so

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.620
this doesn't actually tell us how to
do decision making because all we

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.980
done actually it's we
turned a POMDP into an MDP.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.590
That by the way has
an infinite number of states.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.600
So we can you know we have a number of
algorithms that we can run like linear

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.082
programming or policy iteration or
value iteration.

00:03:32.082 --> 00:03:36.530
And [LAUGH] they all at best grow
polynomial in the number of states.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.100
So it's polynomial in infinity,
so infinity.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.010
&gt;&gt; So it's a constant.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.865
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no.

00:03:41.865 --> 00:03:44.110
[LAUGH] It's bigger than any constant.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.350
So this is problematic.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.430
We can't just Take this MDP now that
we've defined it and just solve it using

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.420
our existing algorithms, we're going to
have to be a little bit more careful.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.430
And so I want to step through
the algorithmic process for

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.220
how you can actually do that.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.510
It's kind of nice I think.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.130
&gt;&gt; Okay, I mean, I can't wait to see
how you make infinity finity, so

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.950
let's do it.
