00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.780
Let's try using our knowledge of completing the square to solve this quadratic

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.915
equation. Now, we want the left-hand side of the equation to contain a square

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:12.382
so that we can take the square root of both sides. In other words, our goal is

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:16.024
to make the left side look like a perfect square. And the right side to be some

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:18.982
sort of number. Then, we could use our square root method that we learned

00:00:18.982 --> 00:00:22.998
before to continue solving. First, let's move this positive seven to the other

00:00:22.998 --> 00:00:26.772
side of the equation. We do this so we can start working towards getting a

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:32.148
perfect square trinomial on the left. And a number on the right. Now that we're

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.262
here, we want to add some amount to both sides of our equation. Remember, we

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:39.664
can only perform the same operation to the left hand side of the equation and

00:00:39.664 --> 00:00:42.850
the right hand side of the equation, in order for our equation to remain

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.645
balanced. So, what amount will we have to add here to complete the square? And

00:00:48.645 --> 00:00:51.945
since we add this amount here, remember, we'll add the same amount on the

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:53.130
right.
