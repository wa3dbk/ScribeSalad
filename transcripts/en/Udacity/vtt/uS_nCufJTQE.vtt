00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.094
So on this graph we can look at the process of classical conditioning. On the

00:00:04.094 --> 00:00:08.840
bottom we have successive trials, and on our vertical axis we have strength of

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.596
the condition response. Notice here we're pairing the condition stimulus with

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:20.401
the uncondition stimulus. That results in acquisition. Next, we present the

00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:25.827
condition stimulus alone. Just the tone. And here, we see the strength of the

00:00:25.827 --> 00:00:31.982
condition response decreases, and it eventually stops. This is extinction. Next

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:37.203
we have a rest period, where we do not present the tone to the dog. Following

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.223
the rest period we present the CS alone, and notice we do have a condition

00:00:41.223 --> 00:00:45.990
response. This is term spontaneous recovery.
