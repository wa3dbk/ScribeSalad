00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.520
So, this was one way that we could find the inverse function. First we switched

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.339
the values of x and y, and then we solve for y and replace that with f inverse

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:17.007
of x. Now there is a quicker way to find the inverse of a linear function. I

00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:21.760
could jet list out what I did to x. First I multiplied x by 2, and then I took

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.536
that result and I added three. So, to undo these operations I would want to

00:00:27.536 --> 00:00:32.753
start with the results and do the inverse of this step. So, I start with the

00:00:32.753 --> 00:00:37.910
result, which is x, and I'm going to subtract 3 first. Then I'll take that

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.654
result and divide it by 2. Notice that to find the inverse function, we first

00:00:42.654 --> 00:00:47.600
undo the last step that we performed for f of x. Then we work backwards and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.750
undo each of the steps before. We can see this for an input like x equals 1.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.830
We'll multiply the input by 2, which equals 2, and then we'll add 3 to that

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.310
result, which equals positive 5. So, if this is a true inverse function. If I

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.474
put in positive 5, I should get out the original input which was 1. So notice,

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:16.088
we'll take 5, use that for the input of our inverse function. And first, we'll

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:21.720
subtract 3, which equals 2. Next, we'll divide that result by 2, so 2 divided

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.693
by 2, equals 1. So, notice how our inverse function undoes the operations that

00:01:27.693 --> 00:01:32.378
was performed on 1. Our original function with an input at 1 gave us an output

00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:37.596
of 5. And then our inverse function with an input of 5 gave us our original

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:40.090
input which was 1.
