One of Bowlby's students, Mary Ainsworth, decided to test his theory in a lab,

00:00:04.038 --> 00:00:07.758
by creating situations of security and separation between infants and

00:00:07.758 --> 00:00:13.330
caregivers. She called this the Strange Situation Test. Ainsworth would have

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.100
the caregiver and the baby come to the lab. The caregiver was often the mother.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.850
And the baby was between six to 12 months old. She would let the two get

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.115
comfortable in the lab and just hang out. Then Ainsworth would have the

00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:27.827
caregiver leave the room for a few minutes, then Ainsworth would observe how

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:33.722
the baby responds when his or her caregiver is gone. Ainsworth focused on two

00:00:33.722 --> 00:00:39.715
things. First, how the baby reacted when the caregiver left. Second, is how the

00:00:39.715 --> 00:00:44.676
baby reacted when the caregiver returned. Ainsworth had hundreds of babies and

00:00:44.676 --> 00:00:48.980
caregivers go through this strain situation test. What she found was clear

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.420
evidence for three distinct kinds of attachment styles.
