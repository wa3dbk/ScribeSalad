00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.270
When dividing bases, we subtract the exponents. So we have 3 to the 2 minus 4 or

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.935
3 to the negative 2. This negative exponent moves the base of 3 to the

00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:15.187
denominator with the power of 2. So we'll have 1 over 3 squared or 1 9th. Here

00:00:15.187 --> 00:00:20.530
I'll subtract the exponents again, f to the 5 minus 8 or f to the negative 3. We

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.249
know this f will be moved to the denominator with a positive power. So 1 over f

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.782
cubed. In both this first example and the second example, you want to think,

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:34.538
where did you have the higher exponent? It was in the denominator. The 3 to the

00:00:34.538 --> 00:00:38.929
4th had the higher exponent than 3 squared. And f to the 8th had a larger

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.732
exponent than f to the 5th. If we look at expanded form, we can see that the 3's

00:00:43.732 --> 00:00:48.394
will simplify, and we're left with 3 of the 2's in the denominator or 1 9th. The

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:53.334
same is true with the f's. 5 of the f's simplify to 1, and then we're left with

00:00:53.334 --> 00:00:57.469
f cubed in the denominator. This should make sense. I have more f's in the

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.964
denominator than I do in numerator. We use a similar resoaning to figure out the

00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:06.585
last one. We should have five more w's in the denominator than the numerator. So

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:10.861
I know w to the 5th is that my denominator. Now I need to figure out the other

00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:14.888
two numbers, 8 divides into 16 and 40 so I'd be left with 2 5th. So I have 2

00:01:14.888 --> 00:01:19.090
divided by 5 times w to the 5th. There's my last fraction. I hope you found a

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.368
lot of different ways to make sense of these exponents. There's no one way or

00:01:23.368 --> 00:01:27.842
wrong way to figure them out. You can apply the properties of power or look at

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:32.200
the expanded forms to get your answers. Just be sure that it's making sense

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.057
along the way.
