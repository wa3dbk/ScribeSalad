Since we know that taking an even root of an equation creates a positive and a

00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:09.160
negative result, we need to be able to enter this new sign, this plus or minus.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.962
Luckily Math Quill has a way for us to do that. To enter this plus or minus

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.771
sign, you want to type in a backslash, and then the letters p and m. Of course,

00:00:17.771 --> 00:00:21.321
p and m here stands for plus or minus. But like most things in math quill, we

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:26.134
also need to enter a space in order for this symbol to appear. Try typing these

00:00:26.134 --> 00:00:30.075
first two expressions using the keystrokes on the screen. And then see if you

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:34.260
can figure out these last two. Keep learning, and good luck.
