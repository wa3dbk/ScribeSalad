Now let's see how many bacteria are alive after some hours of treatment. Please

find B of 0, B of 1, the number of bacteria left after 1 hour, and B of 2, the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.298
number left after yet another hour has passed. You can use a calculator to work

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:18.584
these out and please round to the nearest integer since we are calculating

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.749
bacteria after all.
