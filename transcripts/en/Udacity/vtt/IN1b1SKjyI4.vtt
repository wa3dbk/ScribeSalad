00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:09.018
When we divide 7 by 16, we get 0.4375. And
when we divide 1 by 3, we get 0.3

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:18.516
repeating. If we round this to five
decimal places, we get 0.33333. Though, of

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:25.057
course, this is just an approximation of
the actual fraction. So with this problem,

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:31.192
we see two different types of decimals.
Terminating decimals like .4375 and

00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:37.164
repeating decimals like .3 repeating.
Decimals of these 2 types can always be

00:00:37.176 --> 00:00:42.245
written as fractions. So that means they
are rational numbers.
