One thing to keep in mind,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.120
browsers make no promises that
they'll keep data around forever.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.970
Data can be removed without warning.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.080
For that reason,

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.329
it's important to sync critical data
to the cloud as soon as possible.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.630
The other advantage of doing this is
when the user signs into your app on

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.190
another device, their settings, data and
other information is right there for

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.730
them, and they can pick up
right where they left off.
