00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now let's see how we did.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I'm going to define a set of strategies--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the clueless strategy we expect to do the worst;

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
strategies that try to

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
solve the problem in 4 chunks, in 3 chunks in 2 chunks,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and to solve it all in one win;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and then the max win strategy.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, we play a tournament with these strategies,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and here's the results we get back.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So you can see that the clueless strategy does very poorly--

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
only wins 23 games out of 500.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The max win strategy does the best of all--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
wins 325, but there's some competitors that are pretty close.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So hold at 20 wins 314--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
not that much worse off than the optimal strategy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And that holds up if we play a tournament with more games

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
just to get a little bit more accuracy.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You wouldn't be able to hit the run button and do this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
because it would time out,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but if you bring it in to your own development environment, you can do that.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And here we see max wins gets

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
13,100 wins, and hold at 20 is 12,900.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So only a couple percent better for max wins

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
over hold at 20, but still it's nice to know

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that no strategy can do better.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And it turns out that if we increase the goal

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and made a longer game than just playing to 40 points--

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that the advantage for max wins over any of these other strategies

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
would only increase.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In the betting game, we had different utility functions.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We tried out the linear utility,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and we tried out the logarithmic utility.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What about here?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Well, we defined our utility as a probability of winning,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the way the game is defined, that's really the only sensible one.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
If you're trying to win the game,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you should maximize the probability of winning.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But maybe your only goal isn't just to maximize

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the probability of winning.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Maybe you're in a big Pig tournament,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and your seated at the Pig table, rolling the dice,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and in the stands are lots of spectators,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
watching the game with excitement.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And you know that somewhere in the stands,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
there's a scout from the NPA--the National Pig Association.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And what you want to do is not just win the game--

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
because lots of people are going to win the games--

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but you really want to get the attention of that NPA scout

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
so that you can move on and have a professional career.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So maybe what your utility function would be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
would not just be to win the game,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
maybe your utility would be

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to maximize the differential, to say, "If I just won the game by a couple points,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
nobody is going to notice, but if I won by a lot--

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
if I really clobbered my opponent--

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
then maybe this guy would take notice, and that would be worth more to me."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So you'd give up on the goal of just winning,

00:02:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and try to go for the maximizing your differential.
