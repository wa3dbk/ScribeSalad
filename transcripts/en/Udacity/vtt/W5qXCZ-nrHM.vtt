00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.792
No, we can't necassarily say Andy's more unpopular, even though he has less

00:00:03.792 --> 00:00:08.430
Twitter followers than I have Facebook friends. Because look at the

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.270
distributions, they're both different and we can compare them by looking at

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.849
them on the scale. In other words, in terms of their unique standard

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.841
deviations. This is called standardizing the distributions, using 0 as our

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:26.816
reference point. When we standardize Andy's and my individual scores, I am

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:31.888
further from the mean. Our standardized scores show us the proportion that have

00:00:31.888 --> 00:00:36.600
a lower or higher score in that distribution. In the distribution of Facebook

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.620
friends, there's a greater proportion of people with more friends than me, than

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.876
the proportion of people with more Twitter followers than Andy. So basically

00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:48.713
I'm more unpopular.
