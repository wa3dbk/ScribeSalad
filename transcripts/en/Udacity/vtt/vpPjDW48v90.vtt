00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.880
So let's consider the example of this program here where we do an R and

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.020
then we should branch to the label but instead we mispredicted and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.100
go to a divide, and we really should have executed this multiply.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.340
As far as the processor is concerned, it could look like we first did this,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.470
then we did this, then we finally did this,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.510
resolve the branch, undone this, done this. So at some given point in time.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.990
The processor sees maybe this as fully executed, but not committed,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.180
at that same point in time, only this instruction is percepts committed. So

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.820
the Programmer sees just this as done. If the program finishes this,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.200
until the processor finishes this here. The Programmer is not going to say

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.830
that is executed. So the Programmer never really sees, for example, this divide.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.370
Because by the time the Programmer sees something after the branch execute,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.810
the branch completes execution. And at that point we kill the divide.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.230
We remove it from the row so the Programmer will finally see the branch execute.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.500
But after that. The processor will start fetching from here so the next thing

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.129
the Programmer sees is this. So the Programmer never really sees execution of,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.920
of any wrong path instructions. And on exceptions, the Programmer never sees any

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.570
instructions other than those that should have been executed. So

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.200
basically,. This commit is really kind of the officially executed.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.870
Whereas the actual execution before we broadcast the result, is simply kind of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.170
the internal state of the processor that is maybe not reflected to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.180
the outside world, until we are sure that everything is fine with the result
