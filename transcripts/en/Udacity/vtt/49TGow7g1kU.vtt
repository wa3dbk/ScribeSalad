00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.178
Now that we know how to calculate slope or just the steepness of a line, let's

00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:10.256
go back to our original lines, y equals 2x plus 3 and y equals 1 half x plus 3.

00:00:10.256 --> 00:00:15.435
Well they each have an intercept of 3. So 0 3 is on both of the lines. This blue

00:00:15.435 --> 00:00:20.944
line has another point 1, 5. And this yellow line has another point 2,4. Using

00:00:20.944 --> 00:00:25.171
this information, can you tell me what the slope of each line is?
