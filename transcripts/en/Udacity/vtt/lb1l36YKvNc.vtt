00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.480
In the last level, we learned a ton
about libGDX's drawing capabilities.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.340
In this level, we'll warm up
by drawing some circles and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.650
a stick figure using shape renderer.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.510
Next, we'll create a camera
that allows us to zoom in

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.630
on parts of a larger scene.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.060
Cameras can require you to keep
track of a lot of details,

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.070
especially when you need to
support screens of any size.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.550
So we'll learn about viewports,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.640
which can manage a lot of
these details automatically.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.830
Finally, I've got a few
more drawing challenges for

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.630
you, which will be made a lot
easier using viewports.
