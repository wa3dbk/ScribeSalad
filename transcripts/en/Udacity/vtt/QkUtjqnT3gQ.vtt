00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.028
In our app, we just finished using
what we call a black box for

00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:03.812
handling UI updates.

00:00:03.812 --> 00:00:07.302
We're going to continue to use that
code for the remainder of the course.

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:10.860
I'm going to give you two choices, if
you want to continue the course without

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.796
knowing how the black box works,
then take this blue pill.

00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:18.690
But if you want to see how deep the
rabbit hole goes, the black box goes,

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.110
then take this red pill.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.020
The choice is yours.
