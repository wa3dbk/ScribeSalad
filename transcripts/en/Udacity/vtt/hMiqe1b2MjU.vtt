00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.680
Let's look at the solution
to our block size quiz.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.650
We have a 32 kilobyte cache,
with 64 byte block size.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.970
And the program that
accesses N variables,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.160
that have lots of temporal locality.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.130
Meaning each of these variables is
accessed often in the program, but

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.260
no spatial locality, meaning they're
nowhere close to each other.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.220
The question is what is the largest N,
the number of these variables,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.580
that still results in a high hit rate?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.090
Now X1, when we bring it into the cache,
we will bring an entire

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.120
block worth of stuff around it, and
because there is no spatial locality,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.190
that means that none of the other
variables will be in that block.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.120
When we access X2, same thing,
we will bring 64 bytes worth of stuff

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.470
that doesn't include any
of the other variables.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.000
So every time we access
one of these variables,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.770
we will need 64 bytes worth
of space in the cache.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.380
If we want to have a high hit rate,
because these variables have lots of

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.660
temporal locality, we want all
of them to remain in the cache.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.307
That is,
we want all of them to fit in the cache.

00:01:09.307 --> 00:01:13.918
So the largest N that still results
in a high hit rate Is how many

00:01:13.918 --> 00:01:16.947
blocks can we fit in our cache, really?

00:01:16.947 --> 00:01:21.876
It's a 32 kB cache,
there are 64 byte blocks,

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:26.691
how many blocks do we have,
so the answer is 32 kB

00:01:26.691 --> 00:01:31.300
divided by 64 bytes, which gives us 512.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.770
So the answer here is 512.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.100
If we have 512, or fewer variables,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.990
then the fact that each one of them
has its own cache block in the cache,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.630
although the variable is probably only 4
bytes in size, is not going to hurt us

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.830
in terms of hit rate, but
if we have more than 512 variables.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.290
Then even though there is
plenty of space in the cache,

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.170
if it's four byte variables,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.980
512 variables is two kilobytes worth
of actual stuff that we are using.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.990
The block is much larger than that, but

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.850
because we are fetching an entire
block when we have a miss.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.180
We will not have a good hit rate if we
have more than 512 of these variables.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.710
In order to be able to have more
variables than this, we really need them

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.110
to be close to each other, so that we
can benefit from spacial locality.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.310
Meaning that a block we fetch for

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.590
one variable needs to include
some of the other variables.
