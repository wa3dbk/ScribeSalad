00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.520
In addition to the hardware crypto
capabilities built into each IOS device,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.110
Apple uses a technology
called data protection

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.510
to further protect data stored
in flash memory on the device.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.500
Data protection allows the device
to respond to common events.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.390
Such as incoming phone calls but also
enables a high level of encryption for

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.810
user data.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.930
Critical system apps such as messages,
mail, calendar, contacts,

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.500
photos and health data values
use data protection by default.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.590
And third party apps install on iOS 7 or

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.850
later receive this
protection automatically.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.780
Data protection is implemented
by constructing and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990
managing a hierarchy of keys.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.650
And views on the hardware encryption
technologies going to each IOS device.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.240
Data protection is controlled on
a profile basis by signing each

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.262
file a class.

00:00:56.262 --> 00:01:00.891
And access to the file is determined
by whether the class keys have been

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:01.682
unlocked.

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:06.692
Each time a file is created,
data protection creates a new

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:11.805
256 bit profile key and
gives it to the hardware AS engine

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:17.734
which uses the key to encrypt a file
as it is written to flash memory and

00:01:17.734 --> 00:01:21.542
the encryption is sent
through ASCBC mode.

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:26.920
The profile key is wrapped or encrypted
with one or several class keys.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.980
And the wrapped per file key is
stored in the files metadata.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.290
That is, the file key is used
to encrypt the file contents and

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.380
the key itself is encrypted using
the class key and the encrypted or

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.510
wrapped key is stored
in the files metadata.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.750
The file metadata itself is
encrypted using a file system key.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.670
Then when a file is opened or

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.250
accessed this metadata is encrypted
using the file system key.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.310
This will reveal
the route to profile key

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.340
then the profile key is
unwrapped with the class key.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.620
The profile key then can
be used to decrypt the file

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.790
as it is read from the flash memory.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.430
The metadata of all
files in the file system

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:12.290
is encrypted using the same random key.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.200
We call it the file system key.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.870
This key is created when
iOS is first installed, or

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.380
when the device is wiped by the user.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.070
The class key is protected
with the hardware UID, and for

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.730
some classes, with the user's passcode.
