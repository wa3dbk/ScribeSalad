00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.910
So now that we know the inputs and the outputs,

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.990
the procedure almost writes itself. Especially since we already know the

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.180
code that we wanted to execute before we defined the procedure.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.370
So I'm going to write the procedure, by modifying the code here.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.600
So first what we're going to do is make a little space.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.230
Erasing the code that's not part of the 4 lines that we

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.350
want to turn in the procedure. So now I've, I haven't

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.760
modified the code at all. What I have is, almost exactly what

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.330
I need for the body of the procedure. This is what

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
we want to do. What we need to do is modify that to

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.780
get in the inputs, and turn it into a procedure. So, to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.760
make it a procedure, we need to use the def name syntax.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.000
So we're going to define the procedure. Get next target. So

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.250
now we need our parameters, the parameters are the inputs for

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.600
the procedures and we decided what the input should be.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.420
Is the web contents that's the string giving the contents to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.000
the webpage and that's what we had in the variable

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.010
page. So we can call that page again here, that's what

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.620
we are passing in as our input and now we have

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.020
the body of the procedure. The code is exactly the same

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.180
as the code we had before. But this time, instead of page

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.860
being whatever it was here, page is whatever we pass in as

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.570
the input to the procedure. And we can change the name of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.500
the page. It sort of makes sense to change that name. This

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.110
code works no matter what we pass in. It doesn't have to

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.500
be a webpage. Any string that we pass in, this code will

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.230
find it. So it makes more sense to give it a slightly

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.280
more generic name. We'll change the name to S. If we change

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.160
the name of the parameter, well everywhere that we use page,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.530
now we don't have the value of page. What we have

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.060
is the value of S, which is the name of the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.180
parameter. So we'll change all of those to S's as well. So

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.550
we're almost done. There is one big thing we have left

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.630
to do and that's how do we get the outputs. Right

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.640
we said what we wanted the outputs to be is the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.500
URL and the value of end-quote. We need some way of getting

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.660
those back and the way that you do that

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.772
is to use return. Return's a special construct in

00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:05.490
python. So we have the keyword return, followed by

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.340
a list of all the things that we want

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.250
to return from the procedure. So what we return

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.000
is a list of any number of expressions, seperated

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.030
by commas. We can have zero return expressions, that

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.510
would mean there's no output. And it actually is useful

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.630
to have procedures with no output sometimes. That's not true if

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.950
we just think of procedures as things that map inputs to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.270
outputs, but procedures can also do other things. They can do

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.970
what we call side-effects, and what side-effects are, are things that we

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.760
can see, but that aren't the outputs. And an example of

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.170
a side-effect would be, well, if we printed something out, we would

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.870
see that result happen. We'd see everything that happens when the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.840
code and procedure runs. But we wouldn't get it as an output.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.920
So, in this case, we do want to have outputs from get

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.250
next target. We want to return results, so we know how to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.290
continue. And we decided what the output should be, are the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.880
value of the URL. So we want to find the string that's the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.640
next target. And the value of the end quote, so we

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.800
know the position where it was found. So let's see if you

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.390
can figure out how to finish the return statement. And your

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.850
goal is to figure out the code that we need after the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.090
return, to finish this procedure.
