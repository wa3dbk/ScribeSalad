00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.548
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Thanks, Chris, for telling us all about how to solve absolute value

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:07.482
equations. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; For the first practice problem I want you to try, we're going to

00:00:07.482 --> 00:00:11.384
have the absolute value of 2x minus 5 equals 3. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; You can put your two answers

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:15.433
in these two boxes, because we know absolute value equations have two answers.
