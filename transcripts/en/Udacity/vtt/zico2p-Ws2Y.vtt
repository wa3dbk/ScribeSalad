00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.210
In this demo, we're going to do exactly what we

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.370
did just now in the lesson. We're going to use

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.250
the category partition method to go from a high-level

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.930
description of a piece of software of a program to

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.512
a set of test cases for that program. To

00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:17.640
do that, we're going to use a simple tool. So

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.040
I'm going to show you here the tool that is

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.380
called a tsl generator right here. This tool is available

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.520
to you, so you can look in the class notes to

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.900
see information on how to download it. And together with the tool,

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.890
we are also going to provide a manual for the tool, and

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.680
a set of files that I'm going to use in this demo. So

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.420
you should be able to do exactly what I'm doing. So

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.110
again, all of those are available from the class notes. So specifically,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.390
today we're going to write test cases for the grep program. So in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.970
case you're familiar with the grep utility, this is a simplified version

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.060
of that utility. So basically the grep utility allows you

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.410
to search a file for the occurrences of a given

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.552
pattern. So you can invoke it, as it's shown here

00:01:01.552 --> 00:01:05.570
in the synopsis, by executing grep, the pattern that you're

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.310
looking for, and the filename in which you want to

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.300
look for the pattern. And let me read the description

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.650
of the grep utility. The grep utility searches files for

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.110
a pattern and brings all lines that contain that pattern

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.900
on the standard output. A line that contains multiple occurrences of

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.350
the pattern is printed only once. The pattern is any sequence

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.700
of characters. To include a blank in the pattern, the entire

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.060
pattern must be enclosed in single quotes. To include a quote

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.420
sign in the pattern, the quote sign must be escaped, which

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.260
means that we have to put a slash in front of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.290
the quotes sign. And in general, it is safest to enclose

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.210
the entire pattern in single quotes. So this is our high

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.420
level description for the program, for the softer system, that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.270
we need to test. So now let me show you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.600
what a possible set of categories and partitions could be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.770
for this program. So what I have here is a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.080
file, a textual file, which contains all the categories and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.760
partitions for the elements that are relevant for my program.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.240
In particular, when we look at the file, we can

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.809
see that the file can be characterized by its size.

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.160
And in this case, I've got two choices. The file can

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.050
be empty or not empty. The second characteristic of the file

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.490
that I'm considering is the number of occurrences of the pattern

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.320
in the file. And I'm considering that the pattern might not occur

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.780
in the file or it might occur once, or multiple times.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.264
I'm not going to go through the rest of the file because we

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:31.234
already covered how to apply the category partition method in the

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.226
lesson. So if you had doubts about that, about the method and

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:36.952
how to apply, you might want to go back and watch again the

00:02:36.952 --> 00:02:40.040
lesson. What I want to show you here is how you can go

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.670
from this information that you have here, that we have derived by

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.020
applying the, the first steps of the method, to a set of

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.650
test frames, and then, a set of test packs. So to do

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.240
that we're going to use the tool that I just mentioned. So let

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.670
me bring back my terminal. So first of all, let's see how

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.570
we can run the tool. So you have a manual that will explain

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.180
all the details on how to build the file that we're

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.350
going to feed the tool. So what is the format and so

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.780
on. Here I'm just going to see how I can run the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.828
tool. So first of all, let me point out that this was

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:15.028
developed together by professors from the University of California Irvine and

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:18.020
Oregon State University. And as you can see, we can run

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.968
TSL generator and specify that we want to see the main

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:24.361
page. So in this case if we run it this, this way,

00:03:24.361 --> 00:03:27.723
you'll have some basic information on how to run

00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:30.720
the tool. And from the main page you can see

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.520
that you can specify the minus c flag and in

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.360
this case the TSL generator will report the number of

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.410
test frames generated without writing them to output. For

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.828
example, you might want to use this as we will do

00:03:43.828 --> 00:03:46.308
to see how many tests that you will generate with

00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:49.630
a current set of category partitions and choices. The minus

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.620
s option will bring the result of the TSL

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.620
generator on the standard output. And finally, you can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.330
use minus o to specify an output file, where

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.010
to put the output of the program. So let's

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.070
at first run our TSL generator by specifying the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.620
minus c option and by bypassing our current set

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.860
of category partitions and choices. Okay, so let me

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.140
remind you that what the, the tool will do

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.790
is what we will do manually. Otherwise, which is

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.380
to combine all these choices so as to have one

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.305
test case for each combination. So if we do

00:04:23.305 --> 00:04:27.412
that, you can see that the tool tells us that

00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:32.383
we will generate 7776 test frames in this case.

00:04:32.383 --> 00:04:34.660
And this seems to be a little too much for

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.868
a program as small as the one that we are

00:04:36.868 --> 00:04:40.341
testing. And assume for instance that we don't have the

00:04:40.341 --> 00:04:43.149
resources to run this many test cases for, for

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.518
the grep program. In addition, consider that in this case,

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:50.356
we're computing all possible combinations of choices. And there's going to

00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:52.384
be some combination that do not make sense as we

00:04:52.384 --> 00:04:54.945
discussed in the lesson. So what we might want to

00:04:54.945 --> 00:04:57.051
do in this case is to go back to our

00:04:57.051 --> 00:05:03.120
spec and start adding constraints to eliminate this meaningless combination.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.980
So I'm going to show you the result of doing that.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.690
And I'm going to show you a few examples.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.670
For example here, when the file is empty, I'm going to

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.010
define this property empty file. And how am I

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.490
going to use this property? Well for example here, it

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.760
doesn't make sense to consider the case in which

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.660
we have one or many occurrences of the pattern in

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.020
the file if the file is empty. Therefore I'm

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.650
going to tell the tool that it should consider this specific

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.780
choice only if the file is not empty, only if

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.660
empty file is not defined. And that will skip, for

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.330
example, all of the combinations in which the file is

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.171
empty. And I'm trying to generate the test case that has

00:05:44.171 --> 00:05:46.364
one occurrence of the pattern in the file, which is

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:49.355
simply not possible. For another example, in case I have

00:05:49.355 --> 00:05:52.824
an empty pattern, I define the property empty pattern. And

00:05:52.824 --> 00:05:56.725
then I avoid the choices that involve the pattern in case

00:05:56.725 --> 00:05:59.820
the pattern is empty. because, for example, I cannot

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.900
have quotes in a pattern that is empty. For example,

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.760
it doesn't make sense to have blanks. So, one or

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:10.250
more blanks if the pattern is empty. So I'm going to

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.180
specify again that this choice should be considered only if

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.140
we don't have an empty pattern. And so on and

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.080
so forth. So now after I edit these constraints, I

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.890
can go back and compute again the number of test

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.970
frames and therefore the test cases that will be

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.530
generated with these constraints. So let me go again

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.381
to my terminal. Okay, so now I'm going to run

00:06:30.381 --> 00:06:34.061
my TSL generator again, and I'm going to run it on

00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:37.389
the second version of this file. And you can

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.546
see that I reduced the, the number of test frames

00:06:40.546 --> 00:06:43.889
from about 7800 to about 1700. So it's quite

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:46.967
a, quite a big reduction by eliminating all these combinations

00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.540
that do not make sense. But let's assume again that

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:52.040
we want to reduce this further so that we don't want to

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.610
generate those many test frames and therefore test cases. So

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.660
what can we do? We go back to our spec. And

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.280
in this case, we start adding error constraints. So if

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.200
you remember what we said in the lesson, error constraints are

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.310
constraints that indicate a choice that has to do with an

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.980
erroneous behaviour. For example, an erroneous input provided to the problem.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.210
So here for instance, we're indicating the presence

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.060
of incorrectly enclosing quotes as an error choice. Same

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:22.270
thing if there's no file corresponding to the

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:23.970
name that we provide to the tool, we say

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.760
that this corresponds to an error. So how

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.130
is the tool going to use this information? It uses

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.980
this information by producing only one combination that involves

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.270
error choices, instead of combining them with other choices.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.780
So let's see what happens after we added this

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.370
error constraints. So we go back to our console

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.920
once more. And in this case, we want to run

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.910
the TSL generator with the version of the, of my

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.900
file that contains the area of constraints. And again,

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.390
I reduce quite a bit the number of test frames.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.110
So now I have only 562 test frames that

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:02.660
will be generated by using the file that I provided.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.460
So for the last time, let's assume that we really want

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.780
to cut down the number of test frames or the number of

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.380
test cases. So once more, we go back to our file, and

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:12.980
at this point what we can add is the final type of

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.170
constraints that we have, which are

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:17.245
single constraints. And single constraints are

00:08:17.245 --> 00:08:21.360
basically indicated choices that we don't want to combine with other choices.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.210
So they have the same effect of the error constraints, but they

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.120
have a different meaning, so they do not indicate choices that corresponds

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:29.860
to an error. In other words, I can use a

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.280
single constraints to identify choices that I want to test only once.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.510
So for example in this case, I might decide that I

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.520
want to have only one test frame that tests my program

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.420
with a file being empty and I can do the

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.370
same for other choices. So basically I can continue adding this

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.400
single constraint until I get down to the number of test

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.410
frames and therefore the number of test cases that I want.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.770
So now let's go back once more to our console. And so now if we run

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:04.450
using this file as input, you can see that we have 35 test frames generated. So

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:07.750
this is a fairly low number of test cases, so we might decide that we want to

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:13.380
go ahead and write these test frames to a file. So now let's open this file

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:25.500
that we just generated. And as you can see here, I have exactly 35 test frames,

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:30.900
as expected. Some of those correspond to the single and error cases. So in this

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.330
case, the only choice that I have indicated

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:35.690
is the one that corresponds to the single

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.310
or error constraint. What is for the other

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.170
ones? I actually have the whole test spec.

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.530
So let's pick one just to give you an example.

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:48.440
In this case, that's frame number 15 that will correspond to

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.910
test case number 15. And here you can see that

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:55.280
we have all the information. So this is a test specification.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.560
All the information that we need to generate the corresponding

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.760
test. We know that we need a file that is not

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.810
empty. That we need to have one occurrence of the pattern

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.580
in the file. One occurrence of the pattern in one line.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.360
The position of the pattern in the file can

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.740
be any position. The length of the pattern must

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.640
be more than one character. The pattern should not

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.140
be enclosed in quotes. There should be one white

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.460
space, one quote within the pattern, and finally the

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.230
file that would pass through the program should exist.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.680
So the file should be present. So I can

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:33.950
easily transform all of this into an actual test case.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:35.540
And notice that even though we're not, we're not

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.420
going to do it here. In cases like this, it might

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.190
even be possible to automatically generate the test cases

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.020
from the test specifications because, here for example, here it

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.150
should be relatively straight forward to parse these test

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:52.450
specifications and generate test cases accordingly. So, just to summarize,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.910
what we have done is to go from one high-level

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.880
description of a program to a set of categories, partitions,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.820
and choices for that program. Then we have combined them

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.930
in different ways, adding more and more constraints to reduce the

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:07.600
number of combinations until we ended up with the right number

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.650
of test cases, so the number of test cases that we

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:14.630
were fine generating. We generated the corresponding test specifications. And at

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.340
that point, we could just go ahead, generate the test case,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:20.660
and test our application. So, and you can see how this

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.720
can result in a much more thorough testing of your application.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.890
Because instead of reading this description and just trying to come up with test

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:33.900
cases for it, we can break down the process in steps that are easy to perform

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.960
individually. They can be automated as much

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.600
as possible. And they will end up with

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.380
a set of test cases that will test

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.790
all the interests and aspects of your application.
