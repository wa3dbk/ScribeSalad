00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.830
Before we go on, I actually do want to, throw a little bit of a,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.090
a wrench into this, whole analysis method.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.906
We're going to use a 1-D example to help us understand this.

00:00:09.906 --> 00:00:16.120
Imagine a 1-D signal, basically has a lot of value down here, minus 1,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.220
then a ramp up and positive 1, you can imagine this to be a simple signal,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.400
that basically could be an image, which has black,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.710
here, and white there, and of course, we is counting it this way.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.090
And of course, there's some sort of blurry, boundary between them,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.720
therefore the ramp.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.420
Of course, now the question is, what happens when I actually do a column by

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.020
column, that is just in this direction a differential of this.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.100
There's a lot of noise here, and you can see some of the noise in this, there.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.670
The derivative of this signal, just the 1-D signal,

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.610
in its x will only be kind of capturing the details of the local differences,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.280
and in fact, when it gets to this point here,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.880
you can see a little bit of change, but not much, and in fact,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.670
by looking at this, you can imagine that, it would be hard to actually look for

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.440
a sudden change in gradient, just because it's mostly capturing the noise.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.410
So the essence, in essence, it's, really gets harder to detect an edge, and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.710
there is significant noise in the signal,

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.300
something we will have to start thinking about how we can avoid.
