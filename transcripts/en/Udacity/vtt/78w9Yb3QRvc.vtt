00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.231
So far, the matrix class hasn't done all that much for us. I've shown you how to

00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.326
do exactly what you already knew how to do, translate and rotate around the x, y

00:00:08.326 --> 00:00:12.565
or z-axis. Here's a transform that isn't built in to the object 3D class, axis

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:16.782
angle rotation. And for that, you really do need to use a separate matrix. Say I

00:00:16.782 --> 00:00:20.560
want to make a little star shaped ornament out of four cylinders. Or if you're

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.940
feeling more dramatic, I want to make some carbon fiber caltrops to trip up the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.372
robo-minotaurs about to launch a final assault on our base on[UNKNOWN] Prime,

00:00:27.372 --> 00:00:32.500
it's really our only last hope. I'm better now. Well anyway, I want to align the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.158
four cylinders with the four diagonals of a cube. The hard part is figuring out

00:00:37.158 --> 00:00:41.388
the rotation matrix I want to use. If I'm stuck using Euler angles, do I rotate

00:00:41.388 --> 00:00:45.985
in y, and then in x, or z and then in y, or something else? With the axis/angle

00:00:45.985 --> 00:00:50.710
function, I need to figure out what axis I want to rotate around, and how much

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.690
to rotate. We're going to use cylinders to make our object. Here's a cut-away

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.650
view of the cube, showing the original position of the cylinder and its desired

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.718
location in the wire frame along one of the diagonals. Every cylinder starts

00:01:02.718 --> 00:01:07.883
pointing up along y-axis. Step one is to figure out around which axis to rotate

00:01:07.883 --> 00:01:13.020
this vertical cylinder. I want to rotate the cylinder to the point x y z all

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.600
equal to 1. The question to you is which axis do I want to rotate around in

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.534
order to get this cylinder into its final position? Your choices are axis one,

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:28.238
which is along the y-axis, axis two, which goes along negative x and z, axis

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:34.402
three, which goes along this xyz-axis itself, and your last choice is axis four,

00:01:34.402 --> 00:01:39.498
which goes along the z-axis. Mark each that is correct, if any. If you get

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:43.971
stuck, you might want to go back to the answer for how we formed a disc-shaped

00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:47.673
object out of the swept clock hands, as that might help you out.
