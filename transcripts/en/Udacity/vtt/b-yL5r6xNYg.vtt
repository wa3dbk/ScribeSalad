00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What we've been doing in this unit is looking at a progression of random testers,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
from the simpler ones to the more complicated ones.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And as we've seen, one of the major things creating difficulties for us

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is that structure is required in inputs.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What we're going to do now is look at the next level of structured inputs,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and that level of structure is required for random testing of APIs.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So if you remember from our pictures earlier in the course,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
we have some software under test, and it's providing an API

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or several APIs for other code to use.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And this is the kind of APIs that we're going to focus on testing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
What an API is is basically just a collection of function calls that can be invoked.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And what we're going to find when we test APIs

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is that a single random test is not going to be something extremely simple

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
like a credit card number or a couple of inputs to a single API call

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but rather, a single random test is going to constitute a string of API calls.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
There are a couple of things that make this situation

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
more complicated than what we've seen so far.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The first possibility is that there are dependencies among API calls.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
What this means is there might be certain orderings of API calls,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
perhaps even combined with dependencies on the arguments to those API calls,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that are either illegal or undesirable,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and we're going to need to teach our random tester to avoid those.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So let's just for the moment take the example of randomly testing a file system.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
What file systems are are pieces of code that take the raw abstraction

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
exported by a hard disk driver--so here's the disk itself.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The disk is going to talk to a driver.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The driver is a piece of code running in the operating system

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that understands the details of interacting with whatever kind of particular hard drive

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we're dealing with, and what it exports is the abstraction of a block array.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
A block array just means that from the point of view of the file system,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
what the hard disk looks like is an array of blocks

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where blocks are numbered 0, 1, 2 all the way up to some very large number

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
for a modern hard drive.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And so the purpose of the file system is to take this low level interface of a disk block array

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and build on top of it a hierarchical namespace--that is to say, a directory structure

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
provided by file systems in UNIX or Windows--

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and then those directories, of course, contain files

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and files are just variable sized bags of bits that we can create and delete dynamically.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And so the file system has to manage all of that structure just to manage the free space;

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it has to efficiently respond to all sorts of calls that perform file system operations.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And so let's look at what the file system operations are.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The question is, what are the contents of the file system API?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We have things like mount and unmount,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and these are the calls that invoke the file system code in the first place.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So if a file system is not mounted, it's just sitting there on disk.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's not being used at all.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Once it's mounted, its contents are available to the operating system.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
We have calls like make directory.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Mkdir creates a directory, and remove directory deletes one.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Open can be used to create or just open an existing file.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Unlink deletes one. I'm talking about the UNIX style file system interface.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And then there are a bunch more calls.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So if we want to do random testing of a file system,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
we're going to be issuing sequences of calls in the file system API.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Before we get into the details, let's just think about

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
why we might want to do random testing of a file system.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
First of all, file systems are fairly long and complicated,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and so I looked at the size of 5 of the file systems commonly used on Linux,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and they're all between 15,000 and about 70,000 lines of code.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
File systems end up being substantially large chunks of code,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and what's more, the integrity of our data

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
depends on the correctness of that file system code.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So for example, if we save some critical data to the disk

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and the file system messes it up--that is to say, it saves it in some wrong place

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or corrupts it in some other way--then we're not going to get that data back ever.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And so it's really, really important the file systems work well.
