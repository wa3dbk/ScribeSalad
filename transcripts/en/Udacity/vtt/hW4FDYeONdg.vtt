00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.670
Same document fragment as before, except we've

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.700
now added a CSS style sheet at the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.570
top that renders all paragraph text in

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.390
black. Now, consider what happens when we try

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.190
to execute our inline JavaScript. We region to the document and find all the

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.150
paragraph tags. Grab the first one and set up it's CSS on color style to red.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.890
&gt;&gt; The style sheet says that all paragraphs

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.410
should be rendered with black text. What if this

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.950
CSS style sheet arrives after the script is already executed and sets the color

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.350
to red? Would the browser be smart enough to figure out which color to use?

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.580
&gt;&gt; Yes, it would. Here's a quick diagram that illustrates what actually happens.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.460
The browser requests the HTML, and as soon as it gets the response,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.610
it starts building the DOM. It then discovers the CSS and sends the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.650
request. Then, the parser continues and finds the script tag, at which point

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.440
it has to block. It doesn't know what the script is going to

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.110
do because the script may want to try accessing the CSS properties. So, it

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.209
blocks script execution until the css arrives and we build the css object

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:09.930
model. Only then can we run the JavaScript and then finish building the DOM.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.810
&gt;&gt; Wow, so CSS blocks rendering and it blocks JavaScript execution.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.480
&gt;&gt; Exactly,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.450
which is, once again why optimizing your css is so

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.060
important. On that note, I have a quick quiz for you.
