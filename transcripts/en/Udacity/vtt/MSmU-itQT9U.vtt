00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is no.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Everything we've seen so far any attacker could have generated.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If our communication was actually be intercepted,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
an attacker could generate a certificate that says all of these things.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But instead of having Google's real public key,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we have a public key generated by the attacker.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Just looking at this provides no value yet.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What we need is a signature.
