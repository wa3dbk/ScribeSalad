00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now that you have a large number of tools in your regular expression tool belt.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's put it together and build a new regular expression.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'd like you to submit via the interpreter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Assign to the variable regexp, a Python regular expression that matches lowercase words--

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
letters (a - z) or singly-hypenated lowercase words.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let me show you what that means.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we could have just a word like html or a hyphenated word like well-liked.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But we don't want doubly-hyphenated words like a-b-c or 2 hypens in a row,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
just these 2 options.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And it's worth noting that it may not be possible to get this perfect yet.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.717
Not all problems are solvable. Just do your best.
