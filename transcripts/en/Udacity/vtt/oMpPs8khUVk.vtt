00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.110
So now we saw, this set of re-factoring's. They're nice, but

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.260
how can we actually perform re-factoring's? In some cases you'll have to

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.430
do it by hand. And you'll do it in that case in

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.880
small steps, so that you can check at every step that you

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.180
didn't introduce any area. But there's also many cases in which at

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.640
least for the more standard re-factoring's, you can just apply, you can

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.530
just use a tool that actually supports re-factoring. I'm going to show

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.550
you how that works, into a specific ID, Eclipse through a demo.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.425
To show you how Eclipse, can help in performing

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:31.880
re-factoring, in an automated way, I just opened the Eclipse

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.050
editor and I maximized it. So that we can look

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.810
at the code more clearly. And as you can see

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.551
here, I have this class. It's called Re-factorable, it's a

00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:43.550
pretty indicative name. And what we're going to do, we're going to

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.840
try to apply the extract method re-factoring to this class.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.060
And in particular, to parts of this print owing method.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.090
So this is a matter than will print owing's,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.160
as the name says. And it will do several things

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.180
such as, for example, printing a banner first, then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.650
calculating the outstanding debts, and then printing some details. So

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.980
the starting point for an extract method re-fractoring, is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.650
the identification of some cohesive code fragment. And here, for

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.970
instance, we can see that, if we can see there,

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.350
these three print statements. They are basically printing some banner,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530
for the method. And I also put a comment here

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.160
just to make that even more explicit. So this is a

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.970
perfect case in which we might want to just extract

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.220
this part, create an independent method, so that we can make

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.410
the code more readable and maintainable. So I select, the

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.320
part of the code, that I want to put in my

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.080
method. I invoke the contextual menu, and as you can see

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.287
there is a re-factor entry here. Here are some re-factoring's [UNKNOWN],

00:01:41.287 --> 00:01:45.039
re-factoring's that I can apply, and I'm going to select extract

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.120
method. When I do that, Eclipse is going to ask me to

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.610
specify a method name. I'll just call this one print

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.260
banner. And as you can see, as soon as I do

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.310
that, Eclipse will show me the preview, for the method

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.010
that will be generated. I'm going to leave the access modifier. To

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.290
public and I'm not going to change anything else. So,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.760
now when I click Ok. As you can see Eclipse modified

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.669
my code so that now I have the Print Banner method

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.050
down here that does exactly what that piece of code was doing

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.090
before. And I just have an invocation of the Print Banner

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.440
method, up here, where the code was before. And of course, this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.830
is something that we could have done by hand. It's pretty

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.480
easy to do, but it's even easier, to do it using Eclipse's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.040
capabilities. And this will become even more apparent, when we consider slightly

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.866
more complex case. So here, if we look at this piece of

00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:35.234
code for instance, we can that see this code

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:38.264
prints some details, about the always. And the reason

00:02:38.264 --> 00:02:41.351
why this case is likely more complicated, is because

00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:45.210
this code needs to know about the value of outstanding.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.130
And whereas that underscore name, is a member of

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.150
the class, and therefore will be available to the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.110
method. Outstanding is a locker variable, so a method

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.310
different from print, oh it wouldn't know anything about outstanding.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.070
So let's see what happens when we try to apply

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.460
a re-factoring for this code. So we go again here

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.410
to the re-factor menu, we select extract method, we will

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.080
pick a name again. So let's call it [SOUND] print details,

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.660
since this is what the code does. And as you

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.270
can see here, Eclipse was able to figure out, that outstanding

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.290
has to be a parameter, of this method. So if

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.340
you look at the signature here, this will be very clear.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.270
So outstanding has to be passed to the matter because

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.230
it's a locker variable of the print owing method. so

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.600
it will not be visible to the other methods otherwise.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.990
So since eclipse figured it out, all I have to do,

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.630
is to press Ok. And at this point what I

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.280
will have here is my new method, for in details

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.140
that takes outstanding as a parameter. And does exactly what

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.880
the code was doing before. And here, where the code was,

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.630
I will have my print details invocation, with outstanding

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.930
as a parameter. So now, let's continue to extract methods.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.470
And let's look at a even more complex case. which

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.550
is, the one involving this piece of code. So this

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.900
piece of code, as you can see, will calculate

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.820
the value of the outstanding debt. Will calculate the owing's,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.600
and the way in which it does that, is by

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.080
considering all the orders, that are part of this enumeration.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.519
That is the declared here, and it will

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.769
compute for each one, of these orders, the amount,

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.520
and then added to outstanding. So what is the

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.160
additional complication here? Well, the additional complication here is

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.520
that this code needs to know, not only

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.220
about outstanding. It also needs to know, about this

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.160
enumeration, because this one is also a local variable.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.140
And in addition to that, this code also has

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.280
some side effects. So outstanding, is modified as a

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.600
consequence of the execution of this code. So how can

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.120
we do that in the extracted method? Well let's

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.000
see what the clips will do and what the clips

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.950
will suggest. It will try to again re-factor this

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.030
code and extract the method. In this case as you

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.160
can see. The clips does two things. First of all,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.180
it figures out as before, that there are some parameters,

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.650
that are needed for this method to operate correctly. The

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.600
enumeration e, as we said, and the outstanding variable. In

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.880
addition, if you look at the method signature Eclipse will

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.490
also figure out that this method has to return, a

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.530
double value. So what does this value correspond to? This

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.700
value corresponds to a new value of outstanding. So if

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.490
we, give a name to this method, so we just

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.620
use the name, [SOUND] that I put in the comment

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.510
over there. We click Ok, and this will create

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.560
a method by extracting the code. And here, where the

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.100
method used to be, we will have that the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.169
value of outstanding is updated. Based on the return value

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.260
of calculate outstanding. So in the end if we

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.730
look at this code, you can see that if we

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.980
just focus, on this code it's very easy to

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.150
understand what it does. It prints the banner, it calculates

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.180
an outstanding value, and then it prints some details. And

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.520
in case we don't care, as I said before, about the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.840
details of what these methods do, we're done. And if we

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.740
care about the details we can look at each matter individually.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.580
And get exactly the same information that we got before,

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.650
in a sort of a separation of concerns kind of way,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.420
by focusing on one problem at a time. So now let

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.345
me do one last thing. So let me modify the code,

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:23.170
slightly. So i'm going to go back, to the version of

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.610
the code before re-factoring. So this is what we had.

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:32.480
And I'm going to add, an additional variable here, [SOUND] called count,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.870
which I initialize to zero. Here I'm going to increase, [SOUND]

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.360
the value of count at every iteration. And

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.570
finally, here I'm going to print out the value

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.130
of count. Okay, now that I have this code up. So let's imagine that I

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.665
want to, again as I did before, extract this matter. So, I'm going to

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:58.430
give you a second. Have a look at this and see, if you see

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.170
any problem with that. Feel free to stop the video, if you need more time.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.440
So the problem here is that I have two side effects.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.820
Both outstanding and count are modified. And therefore it's not really

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:19.600
possible to extract this method, and preserve the semantics of this

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.260
code. Let's see if Eclipse will be able to figure that out.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.950
And it does. If we try to extract the matter here,

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.250
you'll tell us that's an ambiguous return value. The selected block

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.800
contains more than one assignment to look at variables. And the

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.170
affected variables are outstanding, just a Double and Count which is

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.780
an integer. So it will refuse to extract the method. So

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.470
at this point if we wanted to do that we have

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.650
we'll have to do the re-factoring a different way, but I

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.110
don't really want to get there. I want to conclude here,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.440
and I hope this this little demo helped you

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:55.310
realize how useful it can be to use an

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.270
id that supports re-factoring that can automate this important

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:00.160
task. And I also encourage you to try to play

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.170
with this, and try to use different re-factoring's, on

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.480
your code. So as to get familiar with the kind

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.060
of re-factoring's that are supported by the ID. And

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.800
also with the re-factoring's themselves and how should be used.
