00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.629
So that concludes this lesson on problem solving, but developing better problem

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.068
solving skills is reallhy a lifetime of effort. I hope some of the guidelines

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:10.500
I've given you today will be useful for solving many problems you'll encounter

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.272
in the futrue. Our first step is alwasy to not panic. Then to think about the

00:00:14.272 --> 00:00:17.200
inputs and the outputs and make sure we understand the problem by working

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.048
through some examples by hand. Then to try and come up with simple mechanical

00:00:21.048 --> 00:00:24.966
solution that will be able to turn into code. And then the final step I'll

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.624
mention, which is what we've been doing the last part, is to develop our

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:32.603
solution incrementally in small steps that we can test as we go. Thank you for

00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:35.836
sticking with the lesson, and I hope you'll solve lots of hard problems in

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:36.273
future.
