00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now the task is to actually write a Python function

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
to compute the acceleration that we have derived before.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
The mass of the earth and the mass of the moon

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and the gravitational constant are already given in that code.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The function that you should write gets the position of the spaceship as 2-dimensional vectors

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and should return a 2-dimensional vector that describes the acceleration of the spaceship.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
There is one nice function of the NumPy package that you will be needing,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
namely, the norm function which computes the length of a vector.
