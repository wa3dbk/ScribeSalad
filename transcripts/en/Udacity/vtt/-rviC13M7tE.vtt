00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's go through the answers together.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If we call ironcrutchli with x as 0,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
then 0 is less than 2, so we're going to return 0.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If we call ironcrutchli when x is 1,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
1 is also less than 2, so we still return 0.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This function not so exciting thus far.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But now we pass in 2 for x, and 2 is not less than 2.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It is equal to 2, however, so we're going to return 2 + 1, or 3.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And then over here if we pass in 9, 9 is not less than 2,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so we're going to return 10.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Iron Crutch Li was one of the 8 immortals of traditional Chinese mythology.

00:00:40.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Not a particularly nice guy, but he did help out the sick.
