00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.220
So what types of shared
memory hardware do we have?

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.020
We can have multiple single cores that
share the same physical address space,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.300
so all of them can each
address to any memory address.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.695
And the examples we have seen
of these are the UMA and NUMA.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.823
Both of them actually
are individual cores,

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:23.950
each of them being able to
access the entire address space.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.840
The other extreme is to only have one
core and then do multi-threading,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.480
basically, run two threads by
just time-sharing the same core.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.170
So, because they're now running
really on the same core,

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.010
they're naturally accessing
the same physical memory.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.698
So, we get the shared memory
behavior simply by virtue of

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.611
actually not having more than one core.

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:49.000
And now the question is,
is there something in-between them?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.782
Because this is not really capable of
benefiting from having multi-threading.

00:00:53.782 --> 00:00:58.312
We can have hardware multi-threading
support in one core that

00:00:58.312 --> 00:01:03.748
actually tries to benefit from
there being multiple threads.

00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:07.330
This hardware multi-threading
can be at the coarse-grain

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.050
where we change the thread we
are working on every few cycles.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.820
And we now need to have hardware
support that switches between threads

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.240
this often, because without hardware
support, we would be spending

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.020
all of the time just saving and
restoring registers of these threads.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.108
So we actually need to now have every
thread has its own set of hardware

00:01:27.108 --> 00:01:28.074
registers and so on.

00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:31.410
So there is hardware support needed for
this.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.160
We can have fine-grain
hardware multi-threading where

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.510
every cycle we are working
on another thread.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.970
This, of course, needs even more
hardware support because now we need to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.230
be able to very quickly
change between these threads.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.938
And, we can also have
simultaneous multi-threading or

00:01:50.938 --> 00:01:52.820
SMT, where in any given cycles,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.370
we could be doing instructions that
belong to these different threads.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.537
This is called
Simultaneous Multi-Threading or SMT.

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:07.090
And it's also called Hyper Threading
by some manufacturers of processors.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.637
So now, we need hardware support for
any one of these three.

00:02:09.637 --> 00:02:12.997
And, of course, the hardware support
becomes more extensive as we move from

00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:15.387
coarse-grain, to fine-grain,
to simultaneous.

00:02:15.387 --> 00:02:17.000
So the question is, but

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.848
what do we benefit by kind of sharing
the same core by multiple threads.

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.320
Don't we get the same thing as here?
