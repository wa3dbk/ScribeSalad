00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.760
This table is showing you the lines of code that the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.710
designers of Xen hypervisor had to change

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.690
in the native operating systems. The two native operating systems that they

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.555
implemented on top of Xen hypervisor are Linux and Windows XP. And you see

00:00:19.555 --> 00:00:26.275
that, in the case of Linux, for instance, the total amount of the original

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:32.979
code base that had to be changed is just about 1%, 1.36%. And in the case

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:39.416
of XP, it is miniscule, almost an annoyance. So in other words, even though,

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:45.304
in para virtualization we have to modify the operating system to run on top of

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:51.284
the hypervisor, the amount of code change that has to be done in the operating

00:00:51.284 --> 00:00:56.669
system in order to make it run on top of the hypervisor. Can be bound to a

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:59.888
very small percentage of the total code base

00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:03.340
of the original operating system. Which is good news.
