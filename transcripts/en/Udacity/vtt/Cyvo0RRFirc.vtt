00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The answer is the third choice, and it's really only necessary to provide the nonce,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but it's helpful to provide the k value as well.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What B needs to check--once this nonce is provided

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
B can check that the incription using A's public key of the output, which is the y2 value,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
with the nonce added--that was the part that Alice removed.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
What Bob needs to do is check that that output is equal to x of k.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And that value was provided directly to B, because all of the inputs from two links ago,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
went into this mix as well as the outputs from A.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This proves to B that for that particular output that B asked for,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that that corresponds to one of the inputs to A.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We can do the same thing all the way down the chain.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That means that A will provide its outputs both to B and C.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
C will be able to verify that B did the mix correctly by picking some random ones,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and having B prove that they're correct.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And at the final stage, B will provide its outputs to C as well as some validator

00:01:05.000 --> 99:59:59.000
who can validate that C did the correct thing.
