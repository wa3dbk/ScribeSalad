00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.949
Well that answer would be no. We can't do this simplification. We cancelled

00:00:04.949 --> 00:00:09.320
terms here. Remember we can only cancel factors, or things that are multiplied

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.146
in the numerator and in the denominator. X minus 6 divided by the quantity x

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:19.294
minus 4, would be our final answer. If you're ever trying to simplify a fraction

00:00:19.294 --> 00:00:23.448
further, ask yourself if you can factor the numerator and the denominator, or if

00:00:23.448 --> 00:00:27.264
you can cancel factors that appear in both. In this case, we can't factor

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:31.351
anything besides 1 out of the numerator and the denominator, and these 2 factors

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.673
aren't the same. So, this is our final result.
