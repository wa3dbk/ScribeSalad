So, in order to add our second JSON
endpoint, we should add a route,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.920
just like specified in the question.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.280
Then we create a new function.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.575
I decided to call it menuItemJSON,
that passes in the restaurant_id and

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.060
menu_id, since both of them
are specified in the URL.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.465
I'll then perform a query to
get the one menu ID that I

00:00:16.465 --> 00:00:18.010
want to get the information about.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.780
I will JSONify that menu item,
but serializing it first.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.800
You can see a copy of this
code in the instructor notes.
