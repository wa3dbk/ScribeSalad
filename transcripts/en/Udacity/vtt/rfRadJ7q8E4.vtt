00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
Now comes the interesting part because the answer is 2^n⁻¹.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.410
The important thing to notice here is the following.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.390
You still have two possibilities of visiting this part here. So there's still two possibilities.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.860
And you also have two possibilities for this part here and all of the other ones in between as well.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.880
But here something interesting happens.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:29.960
If we choose to travel up here then down here then it cost us one extra edge to visit clause #1

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.180
as opposed to if we had gone from this vertex here to this one directly.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.350
Just one extra edge. Now what would happen if we go down here?

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.920
If we were to visit this vertex immediately then we are over here, which means we haven't yet

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.190
visited these two vertices here so we need to go backwards, then up here, and then back.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.380
Something like that--so this is not going to be a false path because we're starting to visit

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.190
cities multiple times and even if we tried to do it another way so maybe just visit this here first

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.060
then we can't go down here again because then we would again visit cities twice.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.990
Also going over here, then up here, then backwards through this

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.560
and also revisit this city here twice.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.850
What you can see is that on a shortest path if we want to visit this vertex down here

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.970
then we must take this route.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.260
If we do not have to visit this vertex, then we don't have to take this route

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.060
then we can still chose arbitrarily.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.920
The number of shortest paths between A and B, if we have to visit that vertex, has been reduced

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.010
and that is pretty neat because that means we can only visit this vertex here on a shortest tour

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.320
if we are going the right way and now you can already see the relationship.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.100
If we connect this clause here to this part here, which represents a variable in the right way

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.380
so that we can only visit this city if the variable is set in the right way

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.780
because we said going up here means true, going down here means false,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.010
then we can ensure that a shortest path from A to B visits this vertex here,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.240
which means that we can also have a satisfying assignment for this clause here.

00:02:09.240 --> 99:59:59.000
And I'll illustrate this for you in more detail.
