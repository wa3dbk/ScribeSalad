Now, of course, we have to keep in mind that

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.930
not all mobile browsers are going to support these new

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.189
input types, at least, not right away. So the question

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.360
is, what do you think should happen if a browser

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.420
doesn't know how to deal with these? Should unknown types

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.470
fail to display? Should the browser automatically send a detailed

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.690
bug report to its vendor? Should unknown types fall back

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.390
to input type equals text? Or do they just crash?
