00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.573
And the way we do that is the process
is called de-identification.

00:00:04.573 --> 00:00:07.980
De-identification essentially
says drop or

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.050
remove all the values that
identify a particular user.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.583
Now, de-identification
alone is not sufficient.

00:00:14.583 --> 00:00:17.630
Sometimes we have to do what
is called anonymization.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.215
So, think about the example where
there was only one student with junior

00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:21.980
standing.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.700
Although we dropped the student ID
that directly identified that student.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.470
But the standing field or
attribute will tell us,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.400
even without the ID,
who that particular tuple is about.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.480
So one way to do that is you can
do some sort of anonymization.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.580
And one way to do anonymization
is what's called generalization.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.140
So you replace an exact value
by a set of values or a range.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.280
So, we may combine
junior-senior standing and

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.960
we can just say upperclassmen or
something like that.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.720
And if you only have juniors and
seniors, then that would then avoid that

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.760
problem we had where the junior standing
identified a particular student.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.270
So, even when you do
the de-identification and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.430
anonymization it has
to be done with care.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.795
Depending on your data set that you
have, or what's stored in the database,

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:12.418
this may not be sufficient.

00:01:12.418 --> 00:01:17.143
Think of an example where we're looking
at people, with certain diseases,

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:19.043
who live in various zip codes.

00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:22.865
So, well someone may be able to make
some sort of an inference based on a zip

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:27.010
code and publicly available information,
addresses, and things like that.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.023
So, we may want to drop the last
digit of the zip code, or

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.959
the last two digits of the zip code.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.918
So that's one way to generalize it.

00:01:33.918 --> 00:01:37.334
Okay?
So, Georgia Tech is 30332.

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.014
If we replace the last two by zero zero,

00:01:40.014 --> 00:01:44.990
then perhaps the three digits we
have match with a much larger area.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.684
But what if,
even after you do that generalization,

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:53.199
the disease that we have is the same
across all those different zip

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:56.584
codes where the first
three digits are the same?

00:01:56.584 --> 00:01:59.688
The disease values are not
diverse enough, let's say,

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.630
if they're exactly the same.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.420
Everybody has some sort of infectious
disease or something like that,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.630
which CDC maybe looking at on how
those infections are spreading out and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.380
stuff like that.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.180
Generalization won't do anything
on that case, isn't it?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.510
Because it's the same value C same
disease D for example that we didn't

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.150
want someone to see that this particular
zip code had incidence of that disease.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.420
That's why we do the realization saying
well it could be any of the four or

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.037
eight or whatever number of zip codes
when you replace the last two digits by

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:32.580
zero zero.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.560
But if the values,
the disease values are not diverse then

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.880
just generalizing or anonymizing
the zip code value doesn't go very far.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.831
So in a generally,
either this transformation involves

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:45.970
de-identification, generalization,
anonymization.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.330
There are things called k-anonymities so
they're at least multiple tuples and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.650
you focus on certain subset of
the values that could be used as a quasi

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.800
identifier are the same in the database
And then we have to see that

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.070
across the same set of quasi-identifiers
that we have, they're multiple values,

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
so we can't say that given
an identifier that we have here, for

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.920
sure we know that this must
be the sensitive value.
