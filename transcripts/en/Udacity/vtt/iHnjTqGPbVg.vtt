00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:06.218
Well, we have that the z-score is 0.56 and we want to find out what value

00:00:06.218 --> 00:00:12.852
corresponds to this in a normal distribution with mean of 50 and a standard

00:00:12.852 --> 00:00:19.672
deviation of 10. So here, we have our setup, so all we do is multiply 0.56 by 10

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:25.971
and then add 50. So this gives us 55.6, so basically, what we did is we took a

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:32.444
pretty spread out distribution with mean 190 and standard deviation 36. We

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:38.588
converted it to the standard normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:45.392
deviation 1. And then, we converted that to a normal distribution with mean of

00:00:45.392 --> 00:00:52.290
50 and standard deviation 10. So the score for each of these distributions

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:59.587
corresponds with the same percentage less than that score. So a score of 210,

00:00:59.587 --> 00:01:06.367
here, the proportion less is exactly the same as a score of 0.56 here. And

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:11.552
that's exactly the same as the proportion less than a score of 55.6 in this

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:17.343
distribution. Hopefully, that makes sense, and if it doesn't, don't worry. It's

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:22.159
going to make more and more sense as you get used to working with normal

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.306
distribution. And in the next lesson, you're going to learn how to calculate the

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:34.278
percentages less than or greater than certain values on the x-axis. Good job.
