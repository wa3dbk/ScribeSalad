Changes on your screens based on the
feedback you've received is fairly easy.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.570
You can quickly draw new versions of
your screens using paper and pen, or

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.750
use a design tool you feel
most comfortable with.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.470
Once you've edited your screens and
saved them as JPEGs, PNGs or GIFs,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.280
simply upload the screens to Envision
once again to replace your screens.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.240
Or, if you're using Envision's sync
tool, simply save your screens with

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.950
the same file names as you had before
in the screens folder of your project.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.820
Envision will automatically handle the
version control of your screens for you.
