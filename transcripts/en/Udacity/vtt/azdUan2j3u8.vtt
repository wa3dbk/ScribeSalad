When creating a visual design layout, it's tempting

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.250
to think of your design surface like a

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.420
canvas, a fixed surface. Now web design used

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.870
to be like this. You drew on this canvas,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.570
it was a fixed size and shape, just like an artist draws on a canvas. What

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.790
do you think the problems with this will

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.850
be, as you move to a mobile first design.
