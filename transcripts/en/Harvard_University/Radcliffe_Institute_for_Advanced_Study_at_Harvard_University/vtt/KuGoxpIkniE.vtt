00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.220
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.280
I'm Tomiko Brown-Nagin,
the dean of the Radcliffe

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.750
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.650
And I'm so pleased to
welcome you all here today

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.390
for this important convening
on unsettled citizens.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.050
Citizenship rights,
or the lack thereof,

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.230
affect individuals,
families, and communities

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.990
in very concrete ways.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.060
Citizenship also
shapes our sense

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.720
of identity and
belonging, so much so

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.000
that many people tend
to think of citizenship

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.100
as immutable, or at the
very least, as settled.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.490
And yet, as we'll explore
today, many individuals

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.910
find that their citizenship
is quite unsettled.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360
Consider, for example,
the US territories.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920
Later today, we'll hear from
Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz Soto

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.225
of San Juan, Puerto Rico.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.670
And as we hear from her,
we should bear in mind

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.200
that people born in her city,
like nearly four million others

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.050
across Puerto Rico,
Guam, the US Virgin

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.440
Islands, and the northern
Mariana Islands, formerly

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.370
lack full protection
under the US constitution

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:17.880
despite birthright
American citizenship.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.940
And American Samoans
as US nationals

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.000
enjoy neither full
citizenship rights

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
nor full constitutional rights.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
These facts aren't
well understood.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.110
In the fall of 2017,
after Hurricane Maria,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.040
the New York Times ran an
article under the headline

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.980
"Nearly Half of Americans Don't
Know Puerto Ricans Are Fellow

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.390
Citizens."

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.110
What's more, the federal
government's response to Maria

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.720
did not fully
reflect the reality

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.660
that the hurricane caused a
domestic humanitarian crisis.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.110
Just 13 days after the
hurricane made landfall,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.530
President Trump visited
Puerto Rico and said,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.730
"I hate to tell
you, Puerto Rico,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.350
but you've thrown our budget
a little out of whack."

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.385
Language that seemingly
defined Puerto Ricans

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:17.820
as other, not a part of us.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.400
Later, in an interview,
he lamented--

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.530
and I'll quote him again--

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.180
"Instead of getting in thank
you, we got bad publicity,"

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.630
as if fulfilling the nation's
obligations to Puerto Rico

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.000
merited special gratitude
from the islanders.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.250
Now, it's a century
old legal doctrine

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.210
that underlines why the US
territories enjoy only limited

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.340
constitutional protections.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.420
And this doctrine emerged
when law and official policy

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.900
were steeped in the
ideologies of white supremacy

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.270
and colonialism.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.300
Just five years after
the US Supreme Court

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.200
upheld racial segregation
in the 1896 case of Plessy

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.720
versus Ferguson,
the court started

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.910
to issue decisions
that differentiated

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.720
between incorporated territories
that would officially

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.750
get statehood like
Arizona and New

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.480
Mexico and unincorporated
territories

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.530
like Puerto Rico that would not.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.800
This doctrine, which
is still in place,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.670
holds that territories acquired
in and following the Spanish

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.150
American War belong
to but aren't

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.570
a part of the United States.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.360
This entirely constructed
difference help

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.820
explains why Americans
in the territories

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.480
can, for instance,
serve in the military

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.260
but can't vote in
national elections.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.520
American citizenship is
then decidedly unsettled.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.820
As immutable as it
may sometimes seem,

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.040
citizenship is constructed.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.380
And it's often directly
linked to histories

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.940
of colonialism, discrimination,
and class distinction.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.820
This conference will wrestle
with several examples

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.070
of unsettled citizens and
unsettled citizenship.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.380
It is a crucial, and it is an
urgent conversation, especially

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.620
now.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.769
A conference like this isn't
possible without the efforts

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.450
of many, many people.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.510
I'm grateful to all of our
conference participants

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.630
for sharing their time
and expertise with us.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.500
Thanks as well to Rebecca
Wassarman, Executive Director

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.100
of Academic Ventures; to
Jessica Viklund, Director

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.940
of Events here at Radcliffe;
and their excellent teams.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.460
And let me also acknowledge
the members of our Radcliffe

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.970
Institute Leadership Society
and all our annual donors who

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.560
support the institute's work.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.170
Thank you.

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.900
Finally, thanks to my
colleague, Dan Carpenter,

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.360
for chairing the Conference
Planning Committee

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.270
and to all of the planning
committee members.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.940
Dan is the Faculty Director
of Social Sciences here

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.580
at Radcliffe as well
as the Allie S. Freed

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.930
Professor of Government.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.810
And it is my pleasure
now to turn things over

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.350
to Professor Carpenter.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.850
Thank you.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.308
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.366
- Thank you, Tomiko.

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:28.100
[CLEARS THROAT] In the presence
of so many of Harvard's

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.010
indigenous sisters
and brothers, I

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.720
want to begin by acknowledging
the indigenous Massachusetts

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.050
homeland on which
we gather today.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.920
And recognizing Harvard as
an organ of the Commonwealth

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.090
of Massachusetts, itself
endowed by a charter that

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.100
commits this university
to the inclusion

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.870
and education of
indigenous peoples,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.740
I want also acknowledge the
Nipmuc and Wampanoag peoples

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.290
on whose traditional homelands
the Commonwealth sits.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.900
People at Radcliffe,
not least the thousands

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.630
of women who experienced
a form of citizenship

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:06.270
at once both limited and
enabled here in Cambridge,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.790
Massachusetts over
many, many decades,

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.910
have been thinking about
citizenship for a long time,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.610
but especially in
the past two years,

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.160
as the nation begins to
examine the centenary

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.180
of the 19th Amendment
and the 150th anniversary

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.370
of the 14th Amendment,
which established

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.420
different kinds of citizenship.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.050
These initiatives are
many, and they are outside

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.630
of this conference,
including last year's gender

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.960
and citizenship conference
entitled "Who Belongs:

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.910
Global Citizenship and
Gender in the 21st Century."

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.550
They also include the long
19th Amendment initiative

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.940
at the Schlesinger
Library; the institute's

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.280
emerging work on incarceration;
research projects on lobbying

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.040
and the financial
services industry;

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.490
our November conference on
disability and citizenship

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.820
and another in December on
the meaning of the midterms;

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.620
and not least, the
digital archive

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.530
of Native American
petitions in Massachusetts,

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:12.700
which Radcliffe has generally
generously supported.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.730
When it came time to
plan this conference,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.710
the Academic Ventures
Group at Harvard,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.830
led by Becky Wassarman, put
together an amazing committee

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.930
of faculty from the University.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.060
I'm proud and honored
to have worked with them

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.260
and to have chaired them.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:30.790
They are, in alphabetical order
of last name, Philip Deloria,

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.620
Professor of History
at Harvard and Chair

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.420
of the Committee on
Degrees in History

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.660
and Literature; Ju
Yon Kim, Professor

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.330
of English at Harvard;
and Gabriela Soto

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.550
Leveaga, Professor of the
History of Science at Harvard.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.940
Our word "citizen" in English
and its equivalent in other

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.110
European languages derives
from the Latin "civitas,"

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.440
"the city," or more
properly, "city-state."

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.780
It is that city-state
and that community

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.630
which defines and
regulates citizenship,

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.350
and citizenship which in
turn composes, reconstitutes,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.890
and reforms the city.

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:12.130
We start with a panel on
economics citizenship.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.340
The communities that defined
and awards citizenship

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:20.290
are also engines of social
and material wealth creation.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:23.020
And the relationship of
community belonging to wealth

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.020
has always raised important
and sometimes troubling

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.790
dimensions of conflict.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.210
Do the duties and rights
attendant to citizenship

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.299
require a minimal level
of material wealth

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:37.669
in order for their realization?

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.950
If so, how much wealth?

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.559
What variety of goods?

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:47.630
Do concentrations of wealth
properly acquire citizenship?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.670
If so, should that citizenship
be limited or fully free?

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.730
The Supreme Court case,
as many of you know,

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.920
that endowed corporations
with free speech

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.400
rights sufficient to strike down
a set of federal contribution

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.100
limits and campaigns
was entitled,

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.040
in all of its delicious
and disturbing irony,

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.400
Citizens United versus the
Federal Election Commission.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.330
But corporations are far more
than concentrations of capital.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.150
Harvard is a corporation.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.030
And this corporation lobbies.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.280
And as we're pleased to hear
from our wonderful guest

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.310
from Alaska momentarily,
Rosita Worl,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.970
Alaska native corporations
are corporations.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:35.470
And so these are often
more complicated issues

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:37.750
than they might seem.

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.700
We next move to a
panel on citizenship

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.440
and its gatekeepers.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.830
Citizenship does not descend
like manna from heaven

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.760
but is made on earth.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.090
It is a human construct,
humanly fashioned.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.490
The community determines
the rules of citizenship

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.530
and how they are applied.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.020
So how do indigenous
nations, for instance,

00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:00.100
regulate belonging based on
aspects of race, genetics,

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.710
and the calculus
of blood quantum?

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.600
How do modern states
such as France

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.990
shape citizenship based
upon language, race,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:10.090
and cultural belonging?

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.670
And what happens when
nations grant citizenship

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.170
to those previously considered
external to its community,

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:19.150
but who have been
let in at some level

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.570
because they provided an
alliance or some service?

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.490
The case of the Hmong
in the United States

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:27.610
provides a window
into these questions.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.390
After lunch, we'll hear
from Mayor Cruz of San Juan.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:33.340
And she'll offer
our keynote address.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.027
I met the mayor last night.

00:10:35.027 --> 00:10:36.610
And let me just tell
you what an honor

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:37.960
it is to have her join us.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.540
I cannot do justice
here-- and I won't--

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.150
to the commitment, the
humanity, and passion

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.170
with which she speaks.

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:45.640
But I will say this.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.380
Won't take too long
getting your lunch.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.060
And the afternoon panel
is entitled citizenship

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.630
on the move.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.300
It speaks to the
fluidity of citizenship,

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.280
it's unruliness in a world
of rule, if you will.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.830
It talks about citizenship
in our ever more mobile world

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.420
where the migrant
and the refugee

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.570
challenge the notions of
citizenship governed by nation

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.610
states and call
upon us to rethink

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:12.930
the geography of community.

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:15.620
We'll consider
citizenship in communities

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.930
that pre-date colonial
and settler state

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.930
borders and even the
categories of citizenship

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:23.520
fashioned by those societies.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.340
And we'll hear how
white Americans consider

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:28.130
their own identity under
threat and how some of them

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:31.350
are redefining that identity
and a form of citizenship

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.330
in increasingly racialized
and eugenic ways.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.430
There are, of course,
themes, many of them

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.320
that we could've
included or interrogated

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.940
more profoundly today.

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:43.700
What is global
citizenship, for instance?

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.530
That is, for what
it's worth, a question

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.720
that we addressed directly
at last year's gender

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.300
and citizenship conference.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.220
It figures not as explicitly
in today's discussions,

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.250
but it's always there.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.500
How has war and
military service,

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.960
or how have they
defined citizenship?

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:04.080
What is the proper balance
between rights and duties

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.520
in thinking about citizenship?

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.770
And what is the
role of education

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.650
in attaining or promoting the
flourishing of citizenship,

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.150
the optimal balance in that way?

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.860
One could also talk
about other areas

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.350
of our planet such as
India and its caste system

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.380
regulating citizenship
for millennia and the way

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.220
that those kinds of systems
have powerful legacies today.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.230
Our discussions
today are necessarily

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:30.860
constrained by the
address of time and space

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.380
and in the aperture
of political regime.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.120
We have but eight
hours before us.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.400
But as with all
such conversations

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.190
at Radcliffe under its
capable leadership,

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:44.240
they will lead to still other
conversations not so commonly

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.990
webcast among students,
scholars, and yes,

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:51.960
citizens for days, weeks,
months, and years to come.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.660
And with that, I want to ask
our first panel to come up

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:59.430
on economic citizenship.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:04.760
It is chaired by my fantastic
colleague at the University,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.650
Professor Kenneth Mack.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:10.910
He is the inaugural Lawrence
Biele Professor of Law

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.580
and Affiliate Professor
of History at Harvard.

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:16.190
You can find other
information about him

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.350
in the conference program.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:19.910
Professor Mack and panelists.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:25.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.170
- Well, thank you
all for coming.

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:31.790
Thank you, Dan, for that
wonderful and capacious

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:35.720
introduction to what we're
going to talk about today.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.810
The title of our panel is
"Economic Citizenship,"

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:43.235
which is obviously a
timely issue at present.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.080
There's been a
revival of interest

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.240
in issues of
economic citizenship

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.960
over the last decade.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:57.730
Commonly cited causes include
the global financial crisis

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.290
and the still unresolved
question of accountability

00:14:02.290 --> 00:14:06.390
for that crisis; the
emergence of new forms

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.570
of economic populism both
within the United States

00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.030
and around the world,
both on the left

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:17.880
and on the right; questioning
the relationship of membership

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.360
in the nation state
to social provision

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:26.060
within and across the
boundaries of nation states;

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.640
the emergence of
questions prompted

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.950
by new forms of knowledge--

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.860
scholarly knowledge--
most famously,

00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:37.490
the research of Piketty
and Saez on the history

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.200
of economic inequality.

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:42.140
But there's been an
outpouring of scholarship

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.720
in many, many fields
on the question

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.940
of economics citizenship
over the last decade.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:50.690
And then law, my own field.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:52.820
As Professor carpenter
noted, there's

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.930
been a sustained debate in
light of the Citizens United

00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.860
decision over the ability of
corporations and the wealthy

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.660
to mold the contours of
citizenship to their liking.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:10.880
Economic citizenship obviously
is also an old question.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.900
It's been debated over
and over across the world

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.380
ever since the advent of
the transition to the system

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:21.140
that we now call capitalism.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.430
And ever since the emergence
of modern nation states

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.950
that made questions of
citizenship and membership

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.920
of all kinds paramount.

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.800
Now, today's panel
is uniquely qualified

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.080
to probe questions of
economic citizenship

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.390
that have emerged
in our own time

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:40.640
in light of the long
history of such questions

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:44.630
being raised, and
also equally qualified

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:48.620
to question the conventional
contours of the debate

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.013
about economic
citizenship, including

00:15:51.013 --> 00:15:52.430
the conventional
markers that I've

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:56.500
outlined in this introduction.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.730
I'm going to introduce them
just by title and the names

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.830
of their most prominent works.

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:06.730
You can find greater
biographical summaries

00:16:06.730 --> 00:16:11.400
of their accomplishments,
which are many, in the program.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.150
Our first speaker is
going to be K. Sabeel

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.640
Rahman, who's Associate
Professor of Law

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.200
at Brooklyn Law School.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.720
He's the author of Democracy
Against Domination, Oxford

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:23.770
University Press 2017 and
the forthcoming Civic Power

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.710
from Cambridge University Press.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.340
Following Professor Rahman
will be Rosita Kaaháni Worl,

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.250
who is the President of the
Sealaska Heritage Institute,

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:41.300
who is the author of many,
many writings and publications,

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.480
among them Indigenous Value:
Strengthening Resiliency

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.740
in Arctic and Rural Communities
and Alaska's Conflicting

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.190
Objectives.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.570
Third, we're going to hear
from Zephyr Teachout, who's

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.330
an Associate Professor of
Law at the Fordham University

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:05.180
School of Law, who's the
author of many publications,

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.599
including Corruption in America:
from Benjamin Franklin's Snuff

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:15.069
Box to Citizens United,
Harvard University Press 2014.

00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:16.839
I'm going to take
them, and they will

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.200
present in the order I've
announced them beginning

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:22.099
with Professor Rahman.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:23.642
- Great.

00:17:23.642 --> 00:17:24.267
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:17:24.267 --> 00:17:29.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:32.455
Thank you so much, Ken, and
Dean Brown-Nagin, and Radcliffe,

00:17:32.455 --> 00:17:33.330
and to our panelists.

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:35.860
Really excited for this
day and this discussion.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.158
So as Professor Mack was
saying, I mean, this really

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:41.700
is such a timely moment to be
thinking about these questions.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.950
And coming into this
panel this morning,

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.710
I was thinking about
the real live fights

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.390
over economic
citizenship playing out

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.570
in so many parts of the country
and around the world, fights

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.790
over the water crisis in
Flint, or over the burning

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.210
of gentrification in cities
like New York or San Francisco

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.000
or Boston even,
the Fight for $15,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.890
and the changing nature of
war, just to name a few.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:07.710
And I name that at
the beginning to say

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.230
that what we're talking
about here is real life.

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.750
And it's not just about kind of
abstract notions of inequality

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.830
and membership.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:18.900
But these are
political fights that

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:21.900
are playing out on many
different terrains of context.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.670
And so for my
remarks here, I want

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:25.510
to sketch out three things.

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:29.070
One is just to unpack a little
bit the different dimensions

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:30.360
of economic citizenship.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.660
So we're used to thinking about
economic inequality, wages

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:34.500
and income.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.362
But there's really
much more going on

00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:37.320
underneath the surface.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.360
And want to kind
of lay that out.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.790
Second is to make the claim
that economic citizenship

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.860
or citizenship more
broadly is not just

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.940
a legal category and
an on/off switch.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:51.420
But I think really all of
us are, in different ways,

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.270
understanding citizenship
as a functional concept,

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.673
that it's really a spectrum.

00:18:55.673 --> 00:18:57.090
There are all these
different ways

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.140
in which law and policy
and politics construct

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.040
different levels of membership.

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:06.480
Who gets to be a full member
with full and equal dignity

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:11.070
and standing in this society
is a topic of contestation.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.810
And then the third, to say
a little bit about the how.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:19.080
So what are the combinations of
ideas, institutional changes,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.430
movement politics that are
needed to change our scope

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.835
and understandings of
economic citizenship?

00:19:26.835 --> 00:19:27.960
So let me start at the top.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.930
So Professor Mack
mentioned the new research

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.493
on inequality, the work of
Piketty and Saez and others.

00:19:34.493 --> 00:19:35.910
And I think that's
absolutely been

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.730
central to the opening up of
the academic conversation.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.150
But if we think back through
the political contestation

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:44.610
over academic citizenship
now and in the course

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:48.900
of American history, I'd argue
that the central concept is not

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.840
just inequality, but
really the problem of power

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.190
and domination.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:58.560
So if you flashback, say, 100
years, the late 19th century,

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.040
the populist parties
gathering in Kansas in 1892.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.080
And they issue their
party platform,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:07.320
and it's styled as a second
Declaration of Independence.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.010
Modeled on Jefferson's,
but where in place

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.190
of the sovereign-- the sovereign
monarch against which democracy

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:15.570
has to rise up--

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:19.410
here, the framing is liberation
from the concentrated

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:24.450
economic power of the new
corporate titans of then

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:26.000
the first Gilded Age.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.310
So this is the era of J. P.
Morgan, the man, not the firm.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:33.360
But still just as terrifying
then as it perhaps is now.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.910
And Vanderbilt and the
railroads and all of the rest.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.160
But the argument here
was that as citizens,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.340
as economic citizens,
people could not

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:45.840
be free when they live under
the effective subjugation

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:50.220
of private power, private firms
that can essentially govern

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.590
the economy for
their own interest

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.870
and in their own profit
without the kinds of checks

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:59.010
and balances that we expect of
any form of sovereign power.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.910
And so there is a broadening
of the idea of democracy

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.250
and citizenship and
membership to take

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:07.590
on the problem of private power.

00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:10.200
Let me give another example,
more contemporary one.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.200
If we think about the
fights over urban inequality

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.310
in recent years, Matt
Desmond's work on eviction,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.690
fights over the rise of housing
prices in New York and Boston,

00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:25.890
San Francisco, part of
what's going on here I think

00:21:25.890 --> 00:21:28.780
is about economic power
and economic membership,

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.320
but in a more subtle way.

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.450
Research shows that the
neighborhood that you're

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.800
born in has intergenerational
effects on your wealth,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.690
your well-being, your health.

00:21:39.690 --> 00:21:44.080
And the rules that govern
where construction happens,

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.690
how cities are zoned,
who lives where,

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.940
where transportation
infrastructure lies,

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:51.120
it's all very kind
of behind the scenes.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.720
But we have effectively
constructed--

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:57.900
or rather reconstructed an
even more egregious form

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.710
of segregation through
our urban policies

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.110
than what we had in
the era of Jim Crow

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.852
and prior to Brown v. Board.

00:22:06.852 --> 00:22:08.060
So there's another dimension.

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:11.340
If the populace were focused on
the problem of corporate power,

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:12.670
this is something more subtle.

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:15.300
It's sort of the accumulation
of background rules

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.450
of the game that changed
the way the city functions

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:20.490
or changed the way
markets function, that

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:23.250
restrict well-being
and opportunity to some

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:27.990
and create levels of economic
membership for others.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.200
A third example, and then
step back for a moment.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.792
The Flint water crisis in
Michigan, which actually is not

00:22:33.792 --> 00:22:34.500
just about Flint.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.690
They're actually
hundreds of cities

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:39.150
that face a similar
configuration

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.700
of lead poisoning,
decaying infrastructure,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.040
with disproportionate impacts
on communities of color

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.352
and low income communities.

00:22:49.352 --> 00:22:51.060
If you think about
what's going on there,

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.480
here you have a basic
necessity, water--

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.970
the most basic thing
that we need to live--

00:22:56.970 --> 00:22:59.100
that is actually
governed by a mix

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.310
of failing government
actors and increasingly

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.253
privatized control.

00:23:03.253 --> 00:23:04.920
Many of the water
systems in our country

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.770
have been privatized
and financialized

00:23:07.770 --> 00:23:09.270
and are actually
under the ownership

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.620
of different private equity
firms around the country.

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:15.810
And you have a
basic good that we

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.080
should be relying on for
basic human well-being that

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.170
has actually been converted into
a form of resource extraction

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.120
for the owners of
the water systems,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.570
with devastating
impacts on communities.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.860
And so this is a third
way in which we play out

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.660
the dimensions of
economic citizenship

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.050
over who gets to access
those most basic goods that

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.090
make humans and
communities flourish.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:41.970
You can tell the same story
about education, the same story

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:42.780
about health care.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.100
These are those basic public
goods that don't just appear.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.140
They're governed and
provided by a mix

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:51.510
of private and public actors.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.000
And the communities that
are able to access them

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.080
fully and freely are a
product of those policies

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.110
and decisions.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.190
So to pull all of that together,
what I think this sketches out

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.280
is three dimensions of
economic citizenship.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.180
The first is are we free with
respect to concentrated forms

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.230
of private power?

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.120
So think the monopolies
and the trusts,

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.670
which Professor Teachout might
talk about more in a moment.

00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:19.710
The second is are we free in
context of those background

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:20.790
rules of the game?

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:24.240
How we structure our city,
how we structure our markets,

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:28.380
how we structure our
firms, who is able to

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.950
access opportunity and
wealth and well-being.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.770
And the third is how
we govern our access

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.050
to basic public goods.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:38.730
Health care, education, water.

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.140
All three of these
things I think

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.930
are dimensions of
economic membership.

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.230
And all three of them are
products of law and policy.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.610
And so what that
means then to me

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.410
is that the fight for
economic citizenship

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:52.320
is really a fight over
power and governance.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:56.100
Who controls these economic
decisions on what terms

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.700
and to what ends.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.010
So then if that's
the case, then I

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.800
think that gives us a much
broader view of citizenship

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.050
as not just a binary on/off.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:09.660
I think what that shows us
is that then citizenship can

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:13.200
actually be tiered
out as a spectrum.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.540
So you may be formerly
a legal member

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.760
of the polity, a legal citizen.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.107
But if you functionally can't
access economic opportunity

00:25:21.107 --> 00:25:23.190
and well-being-- if you
functionally have poisoned

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:29.610
water, if you functionally are
segregated from the centers

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.800
of the city--

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.370
you're not really in effect
a full member of the polity.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:42.420
So the next the next
thing here though then

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:46.260
is if you think about
citizenship as being tiered,

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.960
this also is not just
a state of being.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.310
There is a politics here and
a set of deliberate interests

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.020
going on here.

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.530
So when you think about
why these policies exist

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:01.080
the way they do,
part of what we see

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.290
is the weaponization
of economic policy

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:08.250
in order to restrict who
gets to be a full citizen.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:11.130
So the re-segregation
of our cities

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:15.210
is in part the result of a
fusion of private interests

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.230
of corporations,
zoning interests,

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:22.320
coming from New York, the
Citizens United reference.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.690
Real estate and lobbying
and democracy in New York

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.570
are sort of a pretty
central configuration

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:31.408
of battles that we're fighting
in New York at the moment.

00:26:31.408 --> 00:26:33.450
But so you have a combination
of corporate power,

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:38.420
corporate interests, and
ideologies of racial hierarchy.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.490
There are ways in
which we start to use

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:44.400
these hidden forms of
economic rules and membership

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:50.970
to reassert those types of
economic and racial hierarchy.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.600
So to give another
example, after Brown,

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.110
schools are formally
desegregated.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:59.880
But what happens
is then you have

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.770
a series of efforts where
municipalities, suburban cities

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.050
secede from the central core.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.330
So now the schools are
still technically public,

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.570
but they're only serving the
public that you want to serve.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:15.150
You have the privatization
movement kicks into high gear,

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.340
again, pulling resources out
from the formal public schools.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:20.910
These are all ways of
manipulating economic rules

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:25.660
to reassert a tiered notion
of who gets to have access.

00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:30.690
So what then you have is a fight
for citizenship and membership

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:36.720
and inclusion that is at once
about law and policy and a kind

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:39.540
of technical policy
questions, but also really

00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:42.510
about those most fundamental
issues of who belongs

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:45.690
and who gets to be
part of the polity.

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.890
So let me move to the
last set of topics

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:53.660
and about how we think
about fighting these fights.

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:58.350
And I think there are
really three aspects here.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:01.910
And I think of it as ideas,
institutions, and interests.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:04.470
So on all three of
these dimensions,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:09.410
there's a battle to be waged
for economic citizenship.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:11.840
On the ideas front, I
think the first point here

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.170
is that we need to understand
economic membership

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:17.970
in these broader terms
of power and inclusion,

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:21.260
and not just in sort of narrow
terms of wages and income.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.410
And that connects us to these
long standing traditions

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.500
over economic freedom
and domination

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.350
that go back really
to the founding

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:35.090
and American political thought,
but in global thought as well.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:38.630
On the institution side,
these different dimensions

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.480
of policy making
really I think show

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.310
that we're talking
about a much wider set

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:45.860
of structural debates.

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:49.880
It's not just enough to talk
about wages or job training

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.230
or skills building.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.550
Economic citizenship really has
to be tackling those underlying

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.800
concentrations of corporate
power, those background

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:00.770
rules of the game, the
way in which we structure

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:03.920
our access to public goods.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:06.020
And then on the
interest side-- so this

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.103
is where I think things
get really sticky.

00:29:09.103 --> 00:29:11.145
Because in a lot of ways,
what we're facing now--

00:29:11.145 --> 00:29:13.550
and Dean Brown-Nagin
started with a reference

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:17.240
to the hurricane in Puerto Rico.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:20.240
In some ways, it's
remarkably clarifying

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.130
to see the way in which the
fusion of racial hierarchy,

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:27.890
corporate power,
and anti-democracy

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:34.250
drive a political coalition that
results in the kinds of highly

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.160
unequal forms of citizenship
that we're experiencing

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:39.200
in American politics right now.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.290
And so that's a particular
set of political interests

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:47.540
or ideological interests that
are driving and sustaining

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.483
these types of unequal policies.

00:29:50.483 --> 00:29:51.900
But I'm really
interested in think

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.500
about what are the
kinds of coalitions

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:57.860
and fusions of
interest and movements

00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.680
that can advance a
more inclusive vision

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:01.820
of economic citizenship?

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.040
So here, I think about moments--

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.430
brief moments, perhaps--
but really important moments

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.780
of multiracial inclusive--

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.220
a different kind
of populism maybe

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:17.060
where you think about that
moment of reconstruction

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.000
after the Civil
War where you had

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.890
the aspirations for
racial inclusion

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.230
and a transformative
vision of the economy that

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.290
came with that
before it was often

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.172
violently put down in
the switch to Jim Crow.

00:30:31.172 --> 00:30:33.380
Or you think about the ways
in which the civil rights

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:36.080
movement encompassed
an expansive vision

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:37.670
of economic citizenship as well.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:40.010
So the welfare rights
movement following

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:41.610
after the civil rights movement.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.450
That's where you start to
see some of the early debates

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.290
around things like basic income
as wages for citizenship.

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:52.220
But it's coming from a
movement led by women of color

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.530
and not Silicon Valley folks.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.540
It's a very different
approach to the issue.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.820
So we have these moments of
multiracial inclusive populist

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:02.330
movements.

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:04.850
And I think I would argue
we're in the beginnings of one

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:05.720
such moment now.

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.800
And so where I'll close is
maybe a question for all of us

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.710
to ponder.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:18.320
In this moment of unsettledness
for economic citizenship,

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.270
what are the kinds
of openings that we

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:24.200
see for new coalitions,
new social movements that

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.170
are advancing this more
transformative, inclusive,

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.620
and structural vision for
economic reform that gets us

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.650
to a more settled, but
also more inclusive

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:35.480
understanding of
economic citizenship?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:37.123
So I'll close there.

00:31:37.123 --> 00:31:37.623
Thank you.

00:31:37.623 --> 00:31:41.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.780
- Next, we'll have Rosita Worl.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.865
- [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.620
--most noble people of
the Harvard community.

00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.820
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:04.300
In our culture,
we have a protocol

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.140
of introducing ourselves.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.060
And if I may, I would
like to do that.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:10.960
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:30.815
My Tlingit name is Yeidiklasókw.

00:32:30.815 --> 00:32:31.690
It's an ancient name.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.370
The meaning has
been lost in time.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:35.530
My ceremonial name is Kaaháni.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.503
It means "woman who stands
in the place of a man."

00:32:38.503 --> 00:32:40.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.880
I reminded that to
the board members

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:46.380
that I served on in Sealaska
Corporation for 30 years.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:53.200
I am an Eagle, and I am from the
Thunderbird clan and the House

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.370
Lowered from the Sun.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:58.060
And I am very proud to be
a Child of the Shangukeidí,

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.460
the Sockeye clan.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.140
I am entitled to wear the Eagle,
Thunderbird, and Sun clan crest

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.740
and the White Bear, Killer
Whale, and Shark Spirit

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.000
designs.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.960
In addition, our clan claims
ownership and use rights

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:18.580
to the US Naval military uniform
and to the name "Lieutenant

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:24.490
Frederick Schwatka" because
Lieutenant Fred Schwatka

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:28.150
failed to pay a debt to my
great-great-grandfather.

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:32.290
The Thunderbirds are entitled
to wear Naval uniforms

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:36.190
or semblances of them.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:39.370
Alaska Natives maintain
dual citizenship

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:43.690
as American citizens and
of their respective tribes.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.210
They are similar to other
Native Americans who

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:49.180
are members of federally
recognized tribes,

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.210
but they differ in
one dramatic way.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:57.910
They are also members of Alaska
Native tribal corporations.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.820
Alaska Natives settle their
aboriginal land claims

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:06.420
through the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act of 1971.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.820
And ANCSA created 13
regional corporations

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.750
and 200 plus village
native corporations

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.469
to implement the
claims, thus making

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:22.350
Alaska native shareholders
in these corporations.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.770
Alaska Natives sought full
control over their lands

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:28.920
rather than allowing the
federal government to have

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:31.510
oversight over their lands.

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:34.139
They rejected the
reservation systems

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.110
that are held in trust
by the federal government

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.190
for federally recognized
tribes and instead supported

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:44.460
conveyance of lands held
under fee-simple title

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.300
by corporations.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:51.489
ANCSA corporations differ
from other profit making

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.520
corporations in many respects.

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.980
They are federally
recognized tribes

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.480
for special statutory
purposes in over 100

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.880
federal legislative acts.

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.060
They do not, however,
have sovereign immunity

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.170
or governance authorities that
are prerogatives of tribes.

00:35:11.170 --> 00:35:13.750
They also have social
and cultural dimensions

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:19.330
and responsibilities as well
as the profit making objective.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.210
In addition, they also
have a unique form

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.370
of corporate socialism in that
regional agencies are required

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:32.860
to share 70% of their profits
from subsurface and timber

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.020
development among themselves.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.320
To date, more than
$300 million has been

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:42.860
shared among the regional ANCs.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:45.260
Native American tribes
outside of Alaska

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.280
have full responsibilities for
the welfare of their members.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:54.530
In Alaska, governmental
responsibilities, services,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:59.180
and benefits are dispersed
among tribes, ANCs,

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.860
and several other institutions.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:05.720
We have 10 regional non-profit
tribal organizations

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.020
and two regionally
federally recognized tribes

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.170
that provide a range of
governmental services.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:17.270
We have one statewide and 12
regional health organizations.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:21.650
And we have 12 regional
housing authorities.

00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:25.580
These organizations and tribes
are dependent on federal funds

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.550
to provide the
governmental services.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.940
And as such, they are
required to comply

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.700
with government
eligibility requirements

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:36.890
to receive benefits.

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:40.250
Recipients must demonstrate
that they are enrolled members

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:43.640
of tribes and have a
certificate of degree

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.050
of Indian blood demonstrating
that they meet the blood

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.750
quantum eligibility
requirements that

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:55.640
is most often set at the one
fourth native blood quantum.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.090
While discussions of the rights
and responsibilities of tribes

00:36:59.090 --> 00:37:02.660
and ANCs are worthy,
this discussion

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.630
here provides a
historical review

00:37:05.630 --> 00:37:08.540
of native membership
and citizenships,

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:11.720
which are not synonymous.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:16.160
In our own traditional society,
we have clans and family units,

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.800
and we have tribes and nations.

00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.400
And in these entities, we
have perpetual memberships

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.430
in our tribes and in our clans.

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.130
In 1867, we had the
Treaty of Session,

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:33.380
under which Alaska was sold
by Russia to United States.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:36.980
And Alaska Natives
were classified

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.380
as uncivilized tribes.

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:42.360
Then we have the
General Allotment Act

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.930
that applied to both Native
Americans and Alaska Natives.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:51.300
And we have the blood quantum
system that was introduced.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.680
This act supposedly
was to civilize Indians

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.980
by introducing them
to private property.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:03.450
Tribal lands were
divided into 160 acres,

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:09.210
and surplus lands
totalling 90 million acres

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.270
were transferred into the
public, leaving Indian hands.

00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:16.200
The other interesting
thing about it

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.060
was that the Bureau
of Indian Affairs

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.430
introduced a
competency, or what I

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.910
think is an assimilationist
measurement.

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:28.140
Those Native Americans who
were less than 50% native blood

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.590
didn't have to have
any BIA supervision.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.260
They were viewed as assimilated.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:38.070
Those who were 50%
or more native blood

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:41.310
had to have BIA supervision.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.410
It was possible to
obtain citizenship

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.590
if they severed tribal
relations and adopted

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.780
habits of civilizations.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:54.810
Not too many became citizens.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:39:00.210
In Alaska, we adopted a
Territorial Act of 1915.

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:04.830
And under this, Alaska natives
could achieve citizenship

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:08.700
if they could pass a test
demonstrating qualifications

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.630
to exercise the
obligations of a voter.

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.240
They also had to
abandon tribal customs

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.670
and sever tribal relations.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:21.300
They also had to adopt the
habits of civilizations.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.930
And they had to be certified
by five white citizens.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:26.550
And then after all
of that, they had

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:31.110
to solemnly swear to forever
renounce all tribal customs

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.820
and relationships.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.880
Again, we had very few
that became citizens.

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.510
Except for one,
Charlie Jones, who

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:41.400
was a clan leader
from Wrangell area.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.680
And he had been voting
for a number years

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:48.120
and then went to the
polls to vote in 1922.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:50.580
And he was not allowed to vote.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.790
He called on his
niece, who called

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:57.780
on her father, William L.
Paul, the first Tlingit lawyer

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.400
in Alaska.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.860
They litigated it, and Charlie
Jones got the right to vote,

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:10.410
thereby giving de facto
citizenship to Alaska natives.

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:13.530
In 1924, we have
the Citizenship Act

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.790
that gives citizenships to all
Native Americans and Alaska

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.380
Natives.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.150
We have then the Indian
Reorganization Act of 1934

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.420
that authorizes native
governments and constitutions,

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.300
but it didn't extend to Alaska.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.370
So we went to Congress
to amend the IRA in 1936

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.410
to extend to Alaska.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:43.570
We now have 229 federally
recognized tribes,

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:47.410
but they are sovereigns
without a territorial reach.

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:50.380
And you also have to be
one fourth native blood

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:54.300
quantum to be a tribal member.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:41:00.510
In 1971, we enacted the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:04.410
And under this act, our
aboriginal land claims

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:05.490
were settled.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:10.170
The act established 13
regional corporations and 200

00:41:10.170 --> 00:41:12.780
plus village corporations.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:16.290
Our land-- we received
44 million acres

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:19.200
under fee-simple title.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:24.120
We were given $1 billion
for the extinguishment

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:29.310
of our aboriginal title
to 330 million acres.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:34.010
$1 billion for
330 million acres.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:37.500
A very resource rich land.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.320
But the act also established
that one fourth native blood

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:42.810
quantum for memberships.

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:44.970
But the act also did
something very different

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:51.150
here in it created a new ethnic
group called Alaska Natives.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:57.300
Under this, we were able to
pull our blood quantum from all

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.270
of the different cultural
groups, the Iñupiat, Yupik,

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.890
Aleut, Athabaskan, Tlingit,
Haida, and Tsimshians.

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:09.900
I just wanted to introduce
you to the Marine Mammal Act.

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:15.390
This act provides an exemption
to hunt marine mammals

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:18.430
for Alaska Natives who could
prove that they are one

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.390
fourth native blood quantum.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.820
In the 1980s, we
began to realize

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:27.630
that there were some
restrictions in ANCSA itself

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:30.220
that conflicted with
our cultural values.

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.060
So we went to Congress
to seek an amendment.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.000
And one of those
amendments allowed

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:41.520
us to enroll natives who
were born after 1971.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:43.890
The original act
allowed only for those

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:47.220
who were alive in 1971
to become shareholders.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:52.260
We realized that our lands
were owned by our children--

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:53.970
it was their right
to own our lands.

00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:58.770
And so we wanted to make
sure that we could do that.

00:42:58.770 --> 00:43:00.600
We had a big debate in Congress.

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.960
Our secretary of interior
didn't want us to do that.

00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.980
He wanted to assimilate us.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.720
And we prevailed and
got the authorization.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.010
But we wanted the act to
give automatic enrollment

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.600
to all of our children.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.710
But the compromise was that
we had to have a shareholder

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:24.150
resolution, and it required
a super majority shareholder

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.690
vote.

00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.480
That means you had
to have 50% plus one

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:30.570
of all outstanding
shares to vote in favor

00:43:30.570 --> 00:43:35.190
of enrolling new members.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.340
To date, we have six
regional corporations

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:43.260
that have voted to allow
the enrollment of children

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.350
who are born after 1971.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:50.790
We have four corporations that
adopted the one fourth blood

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:54.240
quantum; Ahtna, Doyon,
NANA, and Sealaska.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.820
I chaired the committee that
oversaw that enrollment.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.060
And I will tell
you, I did surveys,

00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:03.930
I did look at the
demographics, projections.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:06.480
And I also did focus groups.

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.230
And it was really clear
to me that it was possible

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:16.650
that we would not be able
to pass that resolution if I

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.960
went with anything
less than one eighth.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.790
So we went with the one eighth.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:24.270
And as the vote was coming
in, I was really terrified

00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:27.420
because the inspector
of elections

00:44:27.420 --> 00:44:31.170
called me late at night and
said, Rosita, we're losing.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:33.660
And I was just devastated.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.300
And then he called me back
about a couple hours later

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:38.520
and said that he
had made a mistake

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.870
and that we were winning.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:41.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:45.480
So we have another corporation.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.540
The Arctic Slope has
two types of stock.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.830
And one type goes to
those who are one fourth,

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:56.700
and then the other is to those
who have the less than one

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.930
fourth native blood.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:02.580
Only Calista, the
corporation that

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.590
has probably still
the most native blood,

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.530
but went with
lineal descendants.

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.610
So we make a distinction
between membership rights

00:45:14.610 --> 00:45:16.290
and citizenship rights.

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:19.410
Our membership rights are
based on the descendancy

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:24.060
from an enrolled tribal member
or shareholder and blood

00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.050
quantum criteria as defined
in tribal constitutions

00:45:28.050 --> 00:45:30.420
or corporate bylaws.

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:34.910
It establishes our eligibility
for benefits, dividends, health

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:37.530
care, housing, scholarships.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:42.120
And then we have citizenship,
tribal citizenship.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:45.570
Tribal citizens' rights
and responsibilities

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.410
are related to the exercise
of tribal sovereign rights

00:45:49.410 --> 00:45:52.710
and are similar to
that of US citizens.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.180
Memberships in ANCs does not
confer tribal citizenship

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:00.000
rights, although shareholders
do have the right

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.480
to serve and elect leaders
of a board of directors.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:11.280
And they have the right to vote
for other businesses that may

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.830
come before the corporation.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:16.920
I wanted you to take a
look at the blood quantum

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.860
as it exists right now.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:24.120
I don't have any data on Alaska
Natives who are less than one

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.570
fourth the total number.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:28.170
But what I thought I
would do is take a look

00:46:28.170 --> 00:46:34.770
at native people who applied for
their CDIB, their certificate

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:42.000
of Indian blood, in a 10 year
period from 2006 to 2016.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.920
We see that Cook Inlet, 59.3%
of them who are enrolled

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.810
were less than one fourth.

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:51.470
And it goes down.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.560
The highest are those in the
southern coastal regions.

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.280
And you see my region at 32%.

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.610
Even though we were
introduced to Western society

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:04.770
and had contact
with Western society

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:10.240
much earlier than others,
we still are at the 32%.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.530
It's still problematic for
us, discouraging for us.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:16.140
And then you see
Calista at the bottom,

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.360
and they're in
southwestern Alaska.

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:22.960
And 7.5% of them were
less than the one

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.820
fourth when they enrolled
in that 10 year period.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.090
This table does not reflect the
total number of Alaska Natives

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.510
within each region who are less
than one fourth native blood

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:34.350
quantum.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:37.050
We don't have any
current data that

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:40.200
exists of the percentages
of Alaska Natives who

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.080
are less than the one
fourth native blood quantum.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:46.950
However, a recent study by
Sealaska Heritage Institutes

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:49.140
demonstrates from
both qualitative

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:52.830
and quantitative data that an
increasing number of Alaska

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:55.440
Natives are less than the
one fourth native blood,

00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.210
and particularly those in
the southern coastal regions.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:04.140
Tribes and ANCs in
Alaska allow natives

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:06.690
to combine their native
blood from parents

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:09.540
who may be from different
tribes, cultural groups,

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.320
or ANCs to meet the one
fourth native blood quantum

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:15.540
eligibility requirement.

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.720
The ability to combine
blood quantum offsets

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.800
the dilemma faced by some Native
Americans whose parents are

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:24.750
members of different tribes.

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.470
The offspring may be full
blooded Native American,

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:31.770
but not meet the blood
quantum requirement of either

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:33.420
of their parents tribes.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.690
And thus, are not eligible
for tribal membership

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:39.240
in either parents' tribes.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.240
The ability to combine blood
quantum of different Alaska

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.670
Native cultural groups
and corporations

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:48.780
may delay an overall
decreasing native blood quantum

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.300
for an undetermined period.

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:53.910
But we know it's coming.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.860
The issue of blood
quantum has also

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:57.600
become quite controversial.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.670
I mentioned to you
the Marine Mammal Act.

00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:03.060
The Marine Mammal Act allows for
an exemption for Alaska Natives

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:06.990
to hunt marine mammals.

00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:11.290
We've been hunting them for
over 1,000 years or more.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.490
And we use the byproducts for
traditional arts and crafts,

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.440
which are really
important for us

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.000
in our economically
depressed rural communities.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.710
Unfortunately, it has the
one fourth blood quantum

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:26.790
requirement.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.040
And it's in those
southern coastal regions

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:34.200
that are affected the
most by this requirement.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.820
We have been trying
to amend this,

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.200
but we can't come
to an agreement

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.010
in the native
community as of yet.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:43.710
A continued relationship
to the ancestral lands

00:49:43.710 --> 00:49:46.380
continues to be a
significant cultural value

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.000
for Alaska Natives.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.240
Native tribes do not
have a land base.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.520
Instead, it's the
native corporations

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.830
that own our ancestral lands.

00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:00.720
Thus, membership in ANCs
and continued land ownership

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.690
are significant
for Alaska Natives.

00:50:03.690 --> 00:50:07.770
The blood quantum system is
a major Alaska native issue

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:11.790
since it defines membership in
tribes and native corporations

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:15.090
as well as eligibility
for federal services.

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:19.170
Most all of Alaska natives
were organized under the IRA

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:22.320
and use the one fourth
native blood quantum criteria

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.760
for membership.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:28.740
All ANCs with the exception
of one regional corporation

00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:32.100
uses the one fourth native
blood quantum criteria

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.670
to determine
membership eligibility.

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:39.030
The existing data suggests
that if the blood quantum

00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:42.780
system continues to be utilized
to determine membership,

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:47.250
tribes may well be on
a path to extinction.

00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:49.380
An increasing number
of Alaska natives

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:52.710
who are one fourth
and less native blood

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.140
means that native
corporations will

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:57.450
be owned by
shareholders who will

00:50:57.450 --> 00:51:01.920
be predominantly less than
the one fourth native blood.

00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:04.650
The greater fear is
that these shareholders

00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:08.880
may not have the same cultural
values of land ownership

00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:11.610
and may be more
than likely inclined

00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:15.210
to lift the restrictions
on the sale of land.

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:20.520
In fact, some of our CEOs have
called our land wasting assets.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:22.975
I might note that those
are non-native CEOs.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:31.770
I wanted to show you my
grandfather's citizenship

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:33.030
certificate.

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:35.700
My grandfather, John M. Tlunaut.

00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:41.610
He was required to renounce
his tribal relations.

00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:45.810
He had to swear that he
wasn't going to affiliate

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.420
with his tribal relatives.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:51.540
And he had to go before
five teachers who

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:56.250
approved his knowledge that
he knew about citizenship

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.730
and all the responsibilities
of citizenship.

00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:05.070
And then he had to have
five white people sign

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.810
that he was, indeed, a
civilized Alaska Native.

00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.760
He was later pressured--

00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.230
I thought this was interesting.

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.060
He was later pressured
by missionaries

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:20.950
to change his name from Marx.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:26.590
It used to be M-A-R-X. He was
persuaded to change it to Mark

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:29.635
when this name became
unpopular in the United States.

00:52:29.635 --> 00:52:31.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.300
Ironically, I,
his granddaughter,

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.320
now serve as president of the
Sealaska Heritage Institute,

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:42.730
whose mission is to perpetuate
and enhance the Tlingit, Haida,

00:52:42.730 --> 00:52:46.390
and Tsimshian cultures
of Southeast Alaska.

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:47.675
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:52:47.675 --> 00:52:51.555
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:58.350 --> 00:53:01.020
- Next, we have Zephyr Teachout.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:01.920
- Thank you.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.940
That was fascinating.

00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:04.240
Great presentations.

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.600
Well, you just heard
about how governments

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.610
can be corporations.

00:53:08.610 --> 00:53:10.980
I want to talk about
the ways in which--

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.880
following up on a previous
conversation-- corporations

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.590
can play a governmental role.

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.900
And I think one of things
we're all suggesting

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.140
is that we have to shed our
formal understanding of what

00:53:22.140 --> 00:53:26.400
government and citizenship is
and look at the deep functions

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.810
of what's happening.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:32.730
I'm going to spend some time
talking about contract farming.

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:34.380
Hopefully terrify
you into seeing

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.180
that that's the future
of work and that

00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.600
radically changes the
relationship of people

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.710
to power.

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:44.940
But first, I just want to
use one of the oldest or one

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:49.290
of the more terrifying
examples of corporations

00:53:49.290 --> 00:53:52.795
by access to a choke point
playing a governing rule.

00:53:52.795 --> 00:53:54.170
And this is the
credit monopolies

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:56.245
in the late 19th century.

00:53:56.245 --> 00:54:00.930
So late 19th century,
credit monopolies in regions

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:04.320
controlled all access to credit.

00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:10.770
So that meant that freed slaves
looking for credit with which

00:54:10.770 --> 00:54:13.650
to be able to rent
land had to go

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:18.300
to a local store owner, who also
had the only access to credit.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.887
And the local store owner
charged totally usurious rates.

00:54:20.887 --> 00:54:23.220
And it's quite clear they
charged more than they should.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:27.180
So we might stop there and say
this is on its face unfair.

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.040
But it was more than the rates.

00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:32.790
It was actually a governing
relationship because the credit

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:34.560
monopolist would
say, I'm only going

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.250
to lend to you if
you shop at my store

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:42.150
because I also provide
all the dry goods.

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:44.910
That effectively shut
out any competitors

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.970
who might come in and
land at a lower level.

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.970
Because if they
came in, nobody was

00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:51.720
going to shop at their
store because you'd

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:54.630
lose the excess to credit.

00:54:54.630 --> 00:55:01.270
But they also said you can
only plant cotton, even

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:06.640
in cases where cotton was
not the most profitable crop.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:11.230
Because cotton was not a product
that the farmers could then

00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:15.610
use to build
self-sufficiency and get out

00:55:15.610 --> 00:55:19.540
of their relationship
with a credit monopolist.

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.640
It had to be shipped north.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.820
They couldn't basically
cultivate the land in ways

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:28.780
to escape this
governing relationship.

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:30.730
So farming is often--

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:34.937
and in fact, without the boll
weevil and other changes,

00:55:34.937 --> 00:55:36.520
it might have gone
on for even longer.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:39.190
But this was an
effective central role

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.260
in the suppression
of citizenship

00:55:41.260 --> 00:55:45.250
for African-Americans
for over 40 years

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:48.640
is the choke point of
the credit monopolists.

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.690
So farming is often both
an example in itself

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:55.180
terrifying, but also
an example of what else

00:55:55.180 --> 00:55:56.540
is happening in a society.

00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:59.860
So I think we should always
look to farming to see-- look

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:01.818
at the nature of work.

00:56:01.818 --> 00:56:03.610
So I'm going to spend
a few minutes talking

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.070
about contract farming.

00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:12.760
If you are a chicken
farmer, you basically

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:18.130
have to find a way to get
your chicken to market, right?

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:25.300
So right now, in the United
States, 95% of chicken farmers

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:26.860
are basically stuck
in a system where

00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:29.320
the only way they can get
their chicken to market

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:33.490
is they go through Perdue,
Pilgrims, or Tyson.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.290
And if they don't go
through those three,

00:56:35.290 --> 00:56:37.810
they just can't get
their chickens to market.

00:56:37.810 --> 00:56:39.730
So this sounds OK, right?

00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:41.650
But these choke points--

00:56:41.650 --> 00:56:45.580
Tyson, Perdue, Pilgrims-- play
this governing relationship

00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:46.690
to the chicken farmer.

00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:52.145
They don't just extract
value saying basically

00:56:52.145 --> 00:56:54.770
you have to pay these high fees
to get your chickens to market.

00:56:54.770 --> 00:56:57.220
They also say to
the chicken farmer,

00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:00.320
well, if you want us to
distribute your chickens,

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:06.730
you are going to have to use the
hatched eggs that we provide.

00:57:06.730 --> 00:57:11.705
You are going to have to
use the exact specification

00:57:11.705 --> 00:57:13.330
of the chicken houses
that we tell you.

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:15.220
You are going to have
to use our advisors.

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:16.960
You are going to have to
use our watering system.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.000
You are going to have to
use our dimming system.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.583
You are going to
have to use our feed.

00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.530
And if you don't, that's fine.

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:27.350
You are free.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:30.290
We just won't take your
chickens to market.

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.900
Now, the chicken farmers have
taken out a loan typically

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:35.120
around $1 million.

00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.290
And so if those chickens
don't go to market,

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:39.685
they're totally bankrupt.

00:57:39.685 --> 00:57:41.060
So you can see
how, first of all,

00:57:41.060 --> 00:57:43.528
this allows for the
distributor to extract

00:57:43.528 --> 00:57:44.570
enormous amount of value.

00:57:44.570 --> 00:57:47.180
And you may see both Bernie
Sanders and Elizabeth Warren

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:52.040
talking about how farmers get
$0.20 per dollar or less now

00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:54.890
than they did 30 years ago
for all the food that goes

00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:55.612
to market.

00:57:55.612 --> 00:57:56.570
But it's not just that.

00:57:56.570 --> 00:57:57.950
They also sign
contracts that say

00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:59.367
they can't talk
to their neighbors

00:57:59.367 --> 00:58:02.910
about how much Tyson
is paying them.

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:07.100
So embedded in the
contract, there

00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.980
is isolation, social isolation.

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:12.770
You can't even talk to
the farmer you hate.

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:15.290
So when you think of social,
it's not just about solidarity.

00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:17.780
It's about the entire
complicated community that

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:21.860
comes along with economic life.

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:25.600
You can't tell how much
you have been paid.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:28.940
And if suddenly your chicken
production goes way down,

00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:32.240
you don't know whether
it's because Tyson

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.000
is experimenting on you or not.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.080
Essentially, they've created
a panopticon-like arrangement.

00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.770
You may be familiar with
Bentham's panopticon.

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:45.170
The jailer sits in
the center and can

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:48.020
see all the behaviors
of the different people,

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:51.430
but they can't see each other.

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.650
So Tyson can choose.

00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:55.930
Well, let's just
experiment on some feed.

00:58:55.930 --> 00:58:58.840
We'll try these five
farmers with some new feed

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.550
because they are
forced to take the feed

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:03.840
and they are forced not to
know what else is happening.

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.960
So think about what this
does to you as a person.

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.210
Don't forget the wage effect.

00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.430
But think about the
kind of paranoia

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:14.760
that arises when you
are subject to the whims

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.400
and experimentation
of this choke point

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.660
upon whom you depend.

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.970
It also brings this
extraordinary amount of fear--

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:27.230
political fear-- and pockets
where the free speech

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.680
rights that you may be given by
the Constitution don't exist.

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:34.790
In 2010, when there were a
series of hearings on chicken

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:37.190
farmers, several people reported
that the chicken farmers

00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:38.780
weren't showing up
for the hearings

00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:41.690
because they're not stupid.

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:44.383
Perdue can cut them off
and make them go bankrupt

00:59:44.383 --> 00:59:46.550
if they speak up, and they
won't know whether or not

00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:49.670
it's because they
spoke up or not.

00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:53.105
So essentially, this
contract farming,

00:59:53.105 --> 00:59:54.980
which is what it's
called, or chickenization,

00:59:54.980 --> 00:59:56.770
has cut out the farmers tongues.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.640
This isn't just chicken farming.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.685
Think about Uber drivers.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.780
What we see now is in the
realm that we call technology,

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:16.650
a lot of sort of distraction
around the shiny nature

01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.530
of calling various things
technology, which are basically

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:24.570
just introducing the chicken
farming contract farming model

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:27.960
to the nature of work.

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.460
So who owns the information in
an Uber kind of relationship?

01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:34.470
Theoretically, the
drivers are free.

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:37.590
This is the whole sort of story
about the gig economy, which

01:00:37.590 --> 01:00:40.200
is described as
technologically determined as

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:45.150
opposed to the nature
of market organization.

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:49.920
But the Uber driver can get
cut off without a reason.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.727
I talked to some
organizers who--

01:00:51.727 --> 01:00:53.310
I'm hopefully going
to meet him soon--

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.600
but were talking to
an Uber driver who

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.640
was cut off because a
passenger attacked him.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:03.377
So because he was engaged
in an altercation,

01:01:03.377 --> 01:01:05.460
Uber said, we don't want
to be anywhere near that.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.740
But there's no appeal to Uber.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.560
There's no way to appeal
because Uber is just providing

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.730
this service, this platform.

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.950
It's just in the
private realm, right?

01:01:14.950 --> 01:01:17.570
But like the Tyson
relationship to the farmer,

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.020
there's a fundamental
surveillance panopticon

01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:26.520
relationship happening where
Uber can see all the drivers,

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:29.280
can choose to
experiment, can choose

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.460
to send them to go
one way or choose

01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:35.100
to experiment in all kinds
of different economic forms.

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.350
They can experiment well or
they can experiment badly.

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:39.142
By the way, we have to
get rid of this idea

01:01:39.142 --> 01:01:41.430
that just because people
are dominant in the market

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:43.350
means they're smart.

01:01:43.350 --> 01:01:45.997
World history is littered
with armies marching

01:01:45.997 --> 01:01:46.955
in the wrong direction.

01:01:46.955 --> 01:01:48.580
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.820
So power does not
mean intelligence,

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:55.230
but it does being an incredible
new relationship of the worker

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:58.420
to these choke points.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:03.700
Seamless, which
also owns Grubhub,

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.240
they are chickenizing
restaurants.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:12.140
Imagine if you go to
Seamless and look for pizza.

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:16.370
They can disappear
your local restaurant

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:19.280
by just choosing not
to have them there

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.457
and charge high fees.

01:02:22.457 --> 01:02:24.290
The full scope of that
may not be happening.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:26.300
But when we look at
the future, by owning

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.690
what we call the platform,
they have incredible power.

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:33.050
And they change the relationship
of whether it's the restaurant

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:38.000
owner or the Uber driver
or the chicken farmer

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.700
not just to their work,
but to their entire life,

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.830
because you are
put in a position

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:45.340
of informational isolation.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.410
You're typically contracted
out of the ability to sue.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:51.920
Required to go to private courts
called in this gentle language,

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.590
arbitration, alternative
conflict resolution,

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:59.420
which is basically a form
of privatizing and isolating

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:03.110
people's legal disputes
from the public.

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:07.910
So you have isolated,
paranoid, dependent workers.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:10.970
And this is the direction
that work is taking.

01:03:10.970 --> 01:03:13.760
More and more, work
is contracted out.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.190
We can look at it in sort
of gross economic terms.

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:19.100
And I use "gross" in
both senses of the word.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:21.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:23.600
That more and more
people are moving

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:26.450
into outsourcing
the liabilities.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:30.200
Basically, the Uber driver
takes on the risk of the car.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.310
The chicken farmer takes on
the risk of the chicken house.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:38.120
The restaurant takes on
the risk of all the loans

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.930
and what we call these
platforms, distributors, don't

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.820
take on any of that risk.

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.590
And that's gross in that sense.

01:03:45.590 --> 01:03:49.530
But it's also gross in what
it does to us as people.

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.743
It turns us from a
citizens into denizens.

01:03:53.743 --> 01:03:55.410
Now, what I've been
talking about so far

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:59.550
are just the minor lords
of our current system.

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:08.920
The major lords are Amazon,
Google, Facebook, Monsanto,

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.080
Walmart.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.290
Again, we kind of get
the categories wrong.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:18.280
We tend to think about things
in terms of tech or not tech.

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.810
But tech doesn't describe
what is going on.

01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:23.560
First of all, these
are conglomerates.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:29.130
Google about a company
a week in 2011.

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:32.130
Facebook bought Instagram.

01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:39.880
Amazon is a conglomerate of
the Cloud and a platform.

01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.730
They're neither
natural nor platforms.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:45.510
Even the language of "platform"
and "tech," both of them

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:47.670
make us think it's
about technology.

01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:50.880
And it's essentially neutral,
but maybe with a little stuff

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:52.453
at the margins.

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:53.370
They're not platforms.

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:55.490
They're choke points.

01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:56.490
And they're not tech.

01:04:56.490 --> 01:04:59.070
They're new business model.

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:03.120
So if Uber chickenizes
drivers, Amazon

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.740
chickenizes consumer goods.

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:09.290
Imagine you are Bounty.

01:05:09.290 --> 01:05:11.120
Not that I have any
great love for Bounty.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.910
They already monopolized or
quasi-monopolized the paper

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:15.440
towel market.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.610
They already are a problem.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:18.068
So it's not like
we want to go back

01:05:18.068 --> 01:05:20.300
to the good old days of Bounty.

01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:27.620
But Amazon's product
can treat Bounty the way

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.720
that Tyson treats
chicken farmer.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.260
Spy on it, survey
it, learn from it,

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:35.660
experiment on it, shift
it around in your answers

01:05:35.660 --> 01:05:39.530
to the question what
paper towels should I buy?

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:40.430
Squeeze it.

01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:42.830
Demand that Bounty pay its
workers less because they

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:45.230
know all the information
about Bounty's business model,

01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:51.080
and therefore can say, we're
going to set the price here.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.950
Because if you want to get
your paper towels to market,

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.450
this is the way they're coming
because you're consumer goods

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:58.380
and we're Amazon.

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.200
Right?

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.397
But it can also then
study and say, well, we

01:06:02.397 --> 01:06:04.730
want to actually-- now we've
studied Bounty well enough.

01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:07.022
We actually think there's a
pretty decent profit margin

01:06:07.022 --> 01:06:07.610
there.

01:06:07.610 --> 01:06:09.985
We're just going to imitate
Bounty and make our own paper

01:06:09.985 --> 01:06:12.320
towels and sell our
own paper towels.

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.990
So using the producers
of consumer goods

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:19.040
across the country as
subjects in experiments.

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.270
We talk about citizenship.

01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:22.400
And the opposite of
citizenship is denizenship

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:25.640
and being subjected.

01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.270
So that turns these formerly
free business owners

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:30.690
into unfree business owners.

01:06:30.690 --> 01:06:34.250
Now, some of them are
terrible business owners.

01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:37.250
But if we do not have
the space for freedom

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:41.200
in our economic sphere,
there's a real cost there.

01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.140
So I want to end with--

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:49.540
first of all, clearly, we need
a pretty significant revolution

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:53.320
not only to stop
this growing contract

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:56.020
farming of the nature of work.

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:59.050
By the way,
journalists, publishers.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:00.790
Who are they
contract farmers for?

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:07.060
Facebook and Google.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.770
Facebook can and did
change the algorithm,

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:14.250
and the Cleveland Plain
Dealer goes out of business.

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:19.570
It could change it back,
and a news organization

01:07:19.570 --> 01:07:20.890
could come back into business.

01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:24.760
They are essential choke points
that can not only squeeze value

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.010
out of news organizations,
but decide whether or not

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.660
they live or die.

01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:33.250
And by the way, they are trying
to ingratiate ourselves with us

01:07:33.250 --> 01:07:35.680
for recognizing some
degree of their role

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:42.090
in the murder of journalism by
funding non-profit journalism.

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:44.870
This is like the tyrant
saying, don't worry.

01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:46.934
I'm putting out my
own publications.

01:07:46.934 --> 01:07:48.710
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:51.590
So instead of cheering
them for taking control

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:54.735
over more of journalism,
we should make sure

01:07:54.735 --> 01:07:56.360
that our central
communications network

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.860
doesn't have this choke
point kind of relationship.

01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.360
OK.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.050
So we clearly need a
radical reformation.

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:06.350
One of the things
then in this moment--

01:08:06.350 --> 01:08:07.970
which I hope is a
revolutionary moment

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:11.420
because when [INAUDIBLE]
talks about solidarity,

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:15.140
I think about the
suicides of taxi drivers

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.050
and the suicides of
farmers, both of whom

01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:20.689
are living in
situations of despair.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:22.550
And then if we can
start to as a society

01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:26.840
see that they are both
chickenized in similar ways,

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.760
there's opportunities
for solidarity

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.000
to take on these choke
points that will hopefully

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.450
help this revolution happen.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:37.220
One of the things
that I hope that we

01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.050
aim for in this
revolution is something

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:42.760
that the Dalai Lama
tweeted this morning.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:49.160
[LAUGHS] He said, "Any idea
that concern for others,

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:52.340
though a quality, is a
matter for our private lives

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:53.870
only is short-sighted.

01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:57.890
Compassion belongs to every
sphere of activity, including,

01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:01.420
of course, the workplace."

01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.840
Now, this seems like this might
be an uncontroversial topic,

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.899
conceit even on the left.

01:09:07.899 --> 01:09:09.430
But in my last few
minutes, I just

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:13.689
want to plant the seed that the
idea that the economic sphere

01:09:13.689 --> 01:09:18.720
is a sphere of freedom
and moral development

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:21.540
is actually a fairly
controversial on both the left

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.703
and right right now.

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.370
You've seen a
transformation on the left

01:09:26.370 --> 01:09:31.020
from Hayek, who saw
the economic sphere

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:34.229
as a place for essential
moral development

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:36.960
to the modern
neoliberals like Gautier,

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:40.170
who say that basically moral
development should happen

01:09:40.170 --> 01:09:42.300
outside the economic sphere.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.670
We should be radically
profit maximizing

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:47.640
so that we can maximize
efficiencies and then

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:50.729
go be moral elsewhere.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:56.460
Be moral in our church
lives, in our community life,

01:09:56.460 --> 01:09:57.780
in our private lives.

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.870
Morality belongs to
the private sphere.

01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:04.380
But you actually see a
mirror image in many thinkers

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.770
on the left who have
basically given up the market

01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.200
as an irredeemable space.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.380
They fundamentally
associate the language

01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:16.320
of markets, the
fact of a market,

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.610
the fact of a kind
of private exchange

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:25.440
with a radical
corruption of morality.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:29.490
And we see this in basically
Sandel fighting with Sandel.

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:31.260
I say that because
I'm at Harvard,

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.880
for those of you who know him.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.500
There's an old
Sandel who believed

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.333
in the redeemability
of markets, and there's

01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:40.800
a new Sandel who in 2012 wrote
a book about the corruption

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.560
that markets have in
our private sphere,

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:47.040
assuming that market logic
was necessarily immoral,

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.710
or at best, amoral logic.

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:52.950
And I think what we have
to do is as we reconstruct

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:56.850
a new economy, reconstruct
meaningful freedom, including

01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:01.290
moral freedom, embedded so
that we can just be paid well,

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.930
but be compassionate and
loving in our private

01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.652
and our economic life.

01:11:05.652 --> 01:11:06.152
Thank you.

01:11:06.152 --> 01:11:09.624
[APPLAUSE]

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:22.150
- So all of our panelists
have in some ways

01:11:22.150 --> 01:11:24.190
complicated the
conventional narrative

01:11:24.190 --> 01:11:28.570
of economics citizenship that
I introduced the panel with.

01:11:28.570 --> 01:11:30.122
I'd like to do two things.

01:11:30.122 --> 01:11:32.080
I think we want to have
some limited discussion

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.130
among the panel.

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:36.477
I'd like to get all three of
you talking to one another.

01:11:36.477 --> 01:11:38.560
And then after that, we're
going to take questions

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.240
from the audience.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:47.285
And four questions came to mind
as I listened to your remarks.

01:11:47.285 --> 01:11:49.160
And you don't have to
respond to my question.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.410
You can respond to each other.

01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:51.370
It doesn't matter.

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:54.190
But here's four quick questions.

01:11:54.190 --> 01:12:00.490
There's a tension in your
presentations between critiques

01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:03.260
of dominant discourses
of economic citizenship,

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:07.150
be they discourses
grounded in notions

01:12:07.150 --> 01:12:12.620
of US citizenship, which is
sort of imposed from above;

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.320
economic citizenship
imposed by corporations;

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:17.770
and citizenship from
the perspective of those

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:18.970
who are dominated.

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:26.350
How do we sort of get
both on the table?

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:31.210
Related to this,
particular, Rosita Worl

01:12:31.210 --> 01:12:35.050
reminds us that there are many
forms of economic citizenship

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.810
which have been used
by the subalterns

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:40.780
to mobilize alternative
frameworks for citizenship.

01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:44.950
I mean, this complicated,
complex question

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:50.180
of native citizenship in Alaska,
the corporation of the tribes,

01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.610
the clans.

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:54.610
Of course, the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:57.130
is a congressional statute.

01:12:57.130 --> 01:12:59.770
Of course, it's in some measure
imposed from above all those.

01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.960
But yeah, it's complicated.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.670
It was a compromise.

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:07.960
But subaltern groups
are using this thing

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:11.500
to construct their own
forms of citizenship.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.920
There are questions of plural
citizenship within the nation

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:16.360
state.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.150
"Membership" means
so many things.

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:21.970
Being an Uber driver,
being a farmer,

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:26.230
being a member of an
Alaska Native corporation.

01:13:26.230 --> 01:13:29.050
What is citizenship?

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:33.670
Has it lost its analytic
power when we apply the term

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:35.980
to so many things?

01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.330
And finally, is formal
citizenship just blasé?

01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:42.520
We don't really talk
in our discussion

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.670
today about the thing that's
been on lots of people's mind.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:51.100
10 years ago, it was a
pathway to citizenship

01:13:51.100 --> 01:13:52.110
for the undocumented.

01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.860
And now we're talking
about all these sort

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.680
of sublevels of citizenship.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.200
Formal citizenship, is it blasé?

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:01.560
Is it passé?

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:03.620
Does it belong in
this discussion?

01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:05.758
But you guys can take
any of that or anything

01:14:05.758 --> 01:14:06.550
that comes to mind.

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:12.740
Let's do quick responses to
the panel to one another.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:16.190
- Well, great questions.

01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:19.220
I don't think it's blasé at all,
[LAUGHS] to answer your lesson

01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.330
question.

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:24.830
And the thing that
comes to mind to me

01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:32.420
is the extraordinary organizing
of Driscoll farm workers

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.970
in the last few
years, who have been

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:41.180
organizing in Washington state,
many of whom are undocumented.

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:43.430
And so they're playing at a
sort of double subjugation

01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:50.480
role, both being political
members of the larger

01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:53.978
political community
while being undocumented.

01:14:53.978 --> 01:14:55.520
I talked about
certain forms of fear,

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:57.845
but there's a double
fear that comes along

01:14:57.845 --> 01:14:59.470
with the (LAUGHING)
fear of deportation

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:03.170
and a terrifying
fear of deportation.

01:15:03.170 --> 01:15:09.410
And so I think we sort of
have to combine both and see

01:15:09.410 --> 01:15:12.253
a real failure in
formal citizenship.

01:15:12.253 --> 01:15:14.420
This wasn't a conversation
about formal citizenship.

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:16.730
But there is a renal failure
in formal citizenship

01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:19.790
when it doesn't
recognize those who

01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:24.350
are essential parts of
our community as citizens.

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:27.890
And a lot of what
I talked about were

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:32.870
sort of the former quote,
unquote, "middle class"

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:33.915
Driscoll workers.

01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:37.880
Sorry.

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:40.170
I'm sort of winding back
to monopoly [LAUGHS]

01:15:40.170 --> 01:15:41.580
because I always end up there.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:44.598
But Driscoll farm
workers are protesting--

01:15:44.598 --> 01:15:46.140
what they did is
they recognized they

01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:50.370
didn't need to just protest
against their local supplier.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.920
It was actually Driscoll
who was the key.

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.060
So that they are
subject to Driscoll,

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:08.970
but lacking the full scope
of rights in the formal realm

01:16:08.970 --> 01:16:11.250
necessarily has a chilling
impact on their ability

01:16:11.250 --> 01:16:14.340
to exercise their rights in
the private realm as well.

01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:16.090
So I don't think it's
irrelevant at all.

01:16:18.647 --> 01:16:20.480
- Any of these questions
or other questions.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.495
Doesn't matter.

01:16:21.495 --> 01:16:25.300
[LAUGHS]

01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:29.980
- You know, we fought
really hard for citizenship

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.260
because we wanted to control
the institutions that

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.770
were controlling our lives.

01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:36.010
And if we didn't have
the right to vote,

01:16:36.010 --> 01:16:38.380
then we couldn't
become legislators,

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:43.030
we couldn't become
teachers, what not,

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:44.980
controlling those institutions.

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.680
But yet, what happened
was that in order

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:53.380
to become citizens and
have the right to vote,

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.110
it meant that we had to start
losing some of the things

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:58.210
that we had as
indigenous people.

01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:01.270
And we had these examples
where our people would

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:05.440
practice learning English.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:09.670
And they have these sessions,
and they'd all say, spell cat.

01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:14.380
C-A-T. C-A-T. C-A-T. Then
they would have a test.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.880
Who can spell cat?

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:18.370
Somebody would raise their
hand and says, I can.

01:17:18.370 --> 01:17:21.640
A-C-T. A-C-T. A-C-T.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:25.570
So in going for
something that we thought

01:17:25.570 --> 01:17:27.140
was going to be
beneficial to us,

01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.410
we found out that we
were losing things.

01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:31.390
The same thing in the
native corporations.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:35.080
We wanted to have control over
our land and our resources.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.320
And we did not want
to have the government

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.990
say that this is what you
can do with your lands.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:43.480
We found out from our
brothers and sisters

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.670
in the lower 48 that
had reservations.

01:17:46.670 --> 01:17:49.425
Our vets would come back
home, and they would find out

01:17:49.425 --> 01:17:50.800
that the Bureau
of Indian Affairs

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:54.430
had leased out their lands
to ranchers and farmers.

01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:57.470
And so we said we
don't want to do that.

01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:00.910
And so we went for
a fee-simple title,

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.500
and we went for corporations.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:04.720
We didn't know what
corporations were.

01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:07.210
But we knew that under
corporations, you

01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:10.250
could hold land under
fee-simple title.

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:13.420
But then we found out
that, well, that means

01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:15.760
you have to develop your land.

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:19.540
And we didn't want
to develop our land.

01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:25.030
But yet, we were supposed to
be profit making corporations.

01:18:25.030 --> 01:18:27.370
And so we found out
that a lot of times,

01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:30.760
we had a lot of
internal conflicts.

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.860
And so we went to
Congress, and we

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:36.070
said, OK, let's create
land banks so that we could

01:18:36.070 --> 01:18:38.830
put our land into land
banks so we wouldn't

01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:42.220
have to develop the land so
that they wouldn't be taxable.

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:49.390
So what happened was that we
were looking for a benefit,

01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:52.240
but then we'd find
out that it was offset

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:55.210
by something, some requirement.

01:18:55.210 --> 01:18:59.470
In our area, we have trees.

01:18:59.470 --> 01:19:02.560
We live in a
beautiful rain forest.

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:07.190
And so we started
harvesting trees.

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:10.530
And we didn't feel
good about it either.

01:19:10.530 --> 01:19:11.300
Let me tell you.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.330
We shouldn't feel
good, but we knew

01:19:13.330 --> 01:19:18.760
it was our duty to be making
some money for our people

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:21.970
and giving them dividends,
providing them jobs.

01:19:21.970 --> 01:19:25.270
And we would do these
tree ceremonies.

01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:28.930
And here we are thanking
the spirit of the trees

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:31.450
for allowing us to use them.

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.760
But then when we
saw that we almost

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:39.280
cut down all of our old growth,
we said something's wrong here.

01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:43.900
So we actually went on a
retreat and said, what do we do?

01:19:43.900 --> 01:19:47.420
We're conflicting with our
own core cultural values.

01:19:47.420 --> 01:19:50.200
So it was about 15
years ago that we really

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:54.640
did a reassessment of where
we're going as native people

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:56.830
with these native corporations.

01:19:56.830 --> 01:20:00.220
And we also found out we weren't
getting rid of poverty either.

01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:03.550
We still are very
impoverished people.

01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:12.400
And so we said, OK, how
do we harvest our trees

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.840
without cutting them down?

01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:17.230
How do we make money
without cutting them down?

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:21.490
So we started searching
forest certification.

01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:23.920
We started studying
mitigation banks.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.850
We started studying
carbon sequestration.

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:30.100
And I tell you, I
was so proud when we

01:20:30.100 --> 01:20:32.230
got into carbon sequestration.

01:20:32.230 --> 01:20:35.140
But then my granddaughter
comes home and says,

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:37.733
look at what you're
doing to this earth.

01:20:37.733 --> 01:20:39.400
Look at what you're
doing to this earth.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.990
I thought we were
doing something good

01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:42.890
with carbon sequestration.

01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.000
So for us, it's been
this whole dilemma

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.560
of trying to figure out how
do we live in this world?

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.350
And we brought our core
cultural balance values back

01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:56.710
to the forefront.

01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:58.900
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
means "our land."

01:20:58.900 --> 01:21:03.880
It means we have this spiritual
relationship to the land.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:06.850
But it also means
we utilize the land.

01:21:06.850 --> 01:21:09.070
So we found out
you know that are

01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:12.400
our traditional religious
practices were not

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.090
going to mitigate the negative
impacts on our environment.

01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:19.450
So we ended up hiring
teams of scientists

01:21:19.450 --> 01:21:21.280
to try to help us figure out.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.380
Anyway, we're right
in the midst all

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.440
of this trying to figure
out how do we maintain

01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:30.130
our core cultural values?

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:32.850
How do we make sure that
our land is protected

01:21:32.850 --> 01:21:35.490
for future generations
and in accordance

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:39.570
with one of our other
core cultural values?

01:21:39.570 --> 01:21:42.510
I think we have a
lot of dilemmas.

01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:47.520
But what I think is that we're
fortunate in that we still

01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:49.800
have measure of
control where we're

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.020
trying to figure out things.

01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.580
But one of the
things we learned is

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.490
we need to have our
children educated.

01:21:56.490 --> 01:22:01.410
And so we're sending our kids
off to school and saying,

01:22:01.410 --> 01:22:04.860
we need to figure out how do
we live in this New World?

01:22:04.860 --> 01:22:06.720
And I want to thank
Harvard for educating

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:10.350
a lot of our tribal members
from southeast Alaska.

01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:12.420
But it's a journey
that we're on.

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.160
I don't have all of the answers.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.300
But I do know that we have
core cultural values that

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:22.680
have sustained us in our
homeland for 10,000 years.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.680
We know that conclusively
and scientifically.

01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:27.250
So we're trying
to figure it out.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.835
But we don't have
all the answers.

01:22:28.835 --> 01:22:29.460
- That's great.

01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.310
Just to pick up on a
couple of those themes,

01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:34.558
I mean, I think this idea
of citizenship and control

01:22:34.558 --> 01:22:36.600
and the way in which that
control then is further

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:40.680
conditioned or restricted is
really powerful and a through

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:42.190
line for all of us.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:44.310
I think in some
ways what we're all

01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:49.710
touching upon is that for
citizenship to be real,

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:54.450
to have real meaning and force,
that democratic control has

01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:58.350
to spread well beyond the
kind of formal political realm

01:22:58.350 --> 01:23:02.340
to respond to these other
types of conditioning

01:23:02.340 --> 01:23:05.170
or restricting of voice
and accountability.

01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:07.850
And so even if we think about--

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:11.220
in some ways, the
exclusion of membership

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:12.690
has this hydraulics to it.

01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:15.300
You can gain control and
membership in one domain,

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.850
but then have the rug
pulled out from under you

01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:18.900
in another domain.

01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:20.880
Gain political
voice, but then you

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.400
don't have economic voice,
or vise versa, right?

01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:26.400
And so that kind of
sense of whack-a-mole

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.420
is I think part of what we're
all trying to trying to get at.

01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:32.550
I think maybe the last
thing I'll add here

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:38.460
is that I think the unmasking of
those hidden forms of control,

01:23:38.460 --> 01:23:41.490
whether it's through the
conditions attached to property

01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:46.050
claims or the kind of private
governance of the platforms

01:23:46.050 --> 01:23:48.240
that Zephyr was talking about.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:51.630
We need different models
of democratic institutions

01:23:51.630 --> 01:23:55.440
and of collective
action that can create

01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.940
the types of
inclusive empowerment

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:58.920
that respond to these
other types of control.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:02.280
And so it's this constant
experimentation, if you will,

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:04.830
about different vehicles
for collective action

01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:08.310
that aren't just the
formal voting franchise,

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.960
but extend to other
domains as well.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:11.500
- OK.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.000
All right.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.950
So that's great.

01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:16.650
I think it's time for
a conversation that

01:24:16.650 --> 01:24:19.710
extends to all of us.

01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:21.990
So we're going to have
questions from the audience.

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:25.412
I will remind everyone
of four things.

01:24:25.412 --> 01:24:27.120
We have a microphone
at the center aisle.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:30.030
Please come to the
microphone to ask a question.

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:31.480
This panel is being recorded.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.970
It'd be great if your question
can be on the recording.

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:38.300
Second, identify yourself.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:39.240
Who are you?

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:40.597
Maybe your name.

01:24:40.597 --> 01:24:42.060
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:45.460
Third, ask a question--

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:24:46.430 --> 01:24:49.250
--rather than just
offering a comment.

01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:52.280
And fourth, don't
repeat questions.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:54.170
Everybody, just come
up with something

01:24:54.170 --> 01:24:56.321
that somebody before
them didn't ask.

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:02.720
- I'm short, so I'm
putting this down.

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:05.990
[LAUGHS] Thank you
very much for all

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:08.720
that you've said
and shown to us.

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:11.720
My name is Elise Forbes Tripp.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.760
And I happened to
have been involved

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:20.060
in a film that included North
Carolina and North Carolina's

01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.830
voter suppression.

01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:23.690
And one thing you've
done for me today--

01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:26.870
we're just finishing the film--

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:31.220
is show that probably
the powers that be

01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:35.360
aren't just trying to suppress
African-American vote.

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.980
It's poor, poverty that
they are suppressing,

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:47.030
hearing from people who are
not in the economic forefront.

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:49.510
I wonder how you
respond to that,

01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:53.420
the question of the
economic reasons

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:58.090
for suppressing the vote?

01:25:58.090 --> 01:26:00.000
- Are we collecting questions?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:00.500
- No.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:01.875
I think we'll do
them one by one.

01:26:01.875 --> 01:26:05.157
And either one or
all can respond.

01:26:05.157 --> 01:26:05.657
- Great.

01:26:05.657 --> 01:26:07.295
So just a quick thought on that.

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:08.420
Thank you for the question.

01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:10.670
I mean, I think it's
very closely related.

01:26:10.670 --> 01:26:14.180
I mean, it's very
much about reasserting

01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.120
a kind of racial hierarchy, but
also a political and economic

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:17.990
one.

01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:20.720
Voter suppression is
a really good example

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:25.170
of how one of those front lines
for suppressing citizenship.

01:26:25.170 --> 01:26:27.050
You formally have
the right to vote,

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:29.120
but then there are all
these hidden mechanisms

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.570
that can be exploited,
weaponized to restrict

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.580
who actually is able to vote.

01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:39.080
And that has kind of racial and
economic kind of focus, right?

01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:41.840
It's not just neutral
across the board.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:44.150
So I think it's a
really good example

01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:46.610
of some of the dimensions
we're talking about.

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:49.850
- And even more
explicitly, the funders

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:56.630
at the time of the initial
Thom Tillis pushed voter

01:26:56.630 --> 01:27:01.550
suppression bill
in North Carolina--

01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:03.620
the bill was based
on a model bill

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:06.590
created by ALEC, which many
of you may be familiar with.

01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:10.700
The American Legislative
Exchange Council.

01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:17.360
At the time, ALEC was funded
by AT&amp;T, Google, Amazon,

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.580
all of these
different characters.

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:23.330
One of the more successful
anti corporate efforts

01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:29.510
in recent years was an effort to
get many of those corporations

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:32.150
to stop funding ALEC.

01:27:32.150 --> 01:27:34.870
But the truth is they
did in the first place.

01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:36.530
And it took a lot of--

01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:39.830
eventually actually left
ALEC largely because

01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:43.820
of ALEC's funding of stand
your ground gun laws.

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:47.030
But we're relatively
comfortable funding ALEC,

01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:49.460
saying it was because
of other reasons

01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.370
while ALEC was involved in
aggressively pushing the most

01:27:55.370 --> 01:28:02.900
draconian explicitly race
based voter suppression

01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.370
law in the country.

01:28:07.150 --> 01:28:09.520
And I think it's important
because we sometimes

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.710
will look at a place like--

01:28:11.710 --> 01:28:13.960
well, anywhere-- but
like North Carolina

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:20.410
and hold up the lawmakers
who are pushing it

01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:24.160
as the primary drivers.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.960
But we have to
understand that one

01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:30.910
of the key drivers inflaming
racial hatred and division

01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:34.270
in North Carolina was AT&amp;T,
Google, and the other funders

01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:35.030
in this case.

01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:38.530
And meanwhile, AT&amp;T is
also funding the NAACP.

01:28:38.530 --> 01:28:40.050
So it's kind of a double--

01:28:40.050 --> 01:28:42.940
making sure the fingers
are in every pot.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.890
What they'll say
is well, we just

01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:47.680
want to make sure that
nobody can sue anybody.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:49.360
I mean, a lot of
the reasons people

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.630
fund ALEC is because of their--

01:28:52.630 --> 01:28:55.420
they want put it like that--
but [LAUGHS] a lot of reasons

01:28:55.420 --> 01:29:00.760
the big corporations fund ALEC
is to gut access to the courts.

01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:02.200
And it's just detritus.

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:03.850
It's just sort of a
side effect that we

01:29:03.850 --> 01:29:05.500
were suppressing the vote.

01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:08.885
But I think that's
not acceptable.

01:29:08.885 --> 01:29:12.140
[LAUGHS]

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:16.100
- My question go-- first of
all, my name is Julia Carpenter.

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.740
And communication--
and I don't know

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:22.280
if you've heard the Ted
Talk about "the other"

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.690
where we can't seem
to talk to each other.

01:29:25.690 --> 01:29:29.090
It's not just a matter of not
being able to see the person.

01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:31.860
It's like when you see them,
there's no communication.

01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:32.630
Nobody listens.

01:29:32.630 --> 01:29:34.570
Everybody's talking.

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:37.330
How do we communicate?

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:43.960
For instance, PBS,
NPR, all of that--

01:29:43.960 --> 01:29:47.920
the funding of that, you don't
know where that's coming from.

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:52.370
You don't know the
influences behind the screen.

01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:54.760
How do you keep up
to date or how do you

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.360
communicate to get
people to come together

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:02.155
and to act together?

01:30:02.155 --> 01:30:03.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:04.280
- Only that.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:05.780
[LAUGHTER]

01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:10.730
Well, for starters, this is not
a complete answer, but it is,

01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:13.550
I think, a partial,
essential answer.

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:16.730
Too, we have essential
communications infrastructure

01:30:16.730 --> 01:30:17.360
in our country.

01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:24.150
Telephone company, the mail.

01:30:24.150 --> 01:30:27.290
Imagine if the American
mail service started out

01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:31.610
as a surveillance model that
basically the way that mail

01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:33.740
carriers were
going to make money

01:30:33.740 --> 01:30:36.650
is by reading
everybody's mail and then

01:30:36.650 --> 01:30:41.750
pitching them whatever goods
was the best way to pitch them.

01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:43.380
We would find that
kind of problematic.

01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.960
It's necessarily
going to distort

01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:49.010
the flow of mail and
shape what happens

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.080
in that essential
communications infrastructure.

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.955
Well, right now, we have
Google and Facebook,

01:30:52.955 --> 01:30:55.640
two essential communications
infrastructure,

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.310
whose entire business
model is based

01:30:58.310 --> 01:31:02.100
on surveillance and sales.

01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:05.863
So it's almost like if you had
an essential transportation

01:31:05.863 --> 01:31:06.530
infrastructure--

01:31:06.530 --> 01:31:08.900
I think maybe the easier
model for me was the bus.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.720
If our buses made
money off surveillance,

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:14.630
they would, first of all, keep
us in the bus a lot longer,

01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:15.532
right?

01:31:15.532 --> 01:31:17.240
So you have to stay
in the bus as long as

01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.865
possible because then
they can overhear

01:31:18.865 --> 01:31:22.680
our conversations more and be
focused on selling you stuff.

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.190
Well, right now, we have
Facebook and Google,

01:31:25.190 --> 01:31:28.460
whose incentive is
to make us addicted

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:31.280
and to surveil us and
make money off us.

01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:33.350
We do not have to have
essential communications

01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:34.580
infrastructure
that is distorting

01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:35.747
our information in this way.

01:31:35.747 --> 01:31:36.830
We don't have to.

01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:38.810
We didn't have to have
a mail service that way.

01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:40.640
We didn't have to have a
phone service that way.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.190
And we can say that essential
communications infrastructure

01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:44.592
cannot be surveillance based.

01:31:44.592 --> 01:31:46.550
You cannot have a digital
ad based surveillance

01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:47.175
infrastructure.

01:31:47.175 --> 01:31:48.020
We can do that.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.630
It's not a complete answer, but
it sure would help as a start.

01:31:54.395 --> 01:31:55.020
- Anybody else?

01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:56.662
Communication?

01:31:56.662 --> 01:31:58.370
- Well, you would
think this is something

01:31:58.370 --> 01:32:00.700
I would know and could master.

01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:06.020
Because in Alaska, we have
our native versus non-native.

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:10.310
We have our rural versus urban.

01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:14.930
And the lack of
communication has

01:32:14.930 --> 01:32:17.460
been a great problem for us.

01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:21.950
And for my own
little organization,

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:24.350
we said that we
adopted a mission

01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:27.110
to promote cross-cultural
understanding

01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:30.860
and support cultural diversity.

01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.460
And we had to
spend a lot of time

01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:38.810
educating non-native
people about who we are.

01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:42.860
And I actually have to pay
teachers to come in and take

01:32:42.860 --> 01:32:45.380
courses from us to learn,
because we pay them,

01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:47.043
and they can get their credit.

01:32:47.043 --> 01:32:49.460
And they're really important
because they're the ones that

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:52.160
teach our children.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:54.710
And so in Alaska,
we've spent tons

01:32:54.710 --> 01:32:58.160
of money trying to
reach out to the other,

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.960
to educate them about--

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.930
like our hunting
and fishing rights.

01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:05.690
We still are dependent
on hunting and fishing

01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:08.390
for our survival, plus
a cultural attachment

01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:09.200
to the land.

01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:13.970
But we have commercial
hunters and fishers,

01:33:13.970 --> 01:33:19.970
and we have sports people
that control everything.

01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:25.220
We take only 2% of hunting
and fishing resources

01:33:25.220 --> 01:33:27.950
for our subsistence purposes.

01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:32.770
But yet people want to--
they talk about equality,

01:33:32.770 --> 01:33:38.210
this whole issue of equality
and say we have to be all equal.

01:33:38.210 --> 01:33:40.010
And I said, well,
OK, I like that.

01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:43.080
How about if we have one
third of all the fisheries

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:44.240
and resources?

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:46.640
Because right now,
we're only getting 2%?

01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:47.960
But I don't know.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.030
It's just something
that we live and breathe

01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:52.910
with all of the time,
trying to reach out.

01:33:52.910 --> 01:33:58.460
How do we get to
communicate with people?

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:01.530
And I was thinking about the
other question that was asked.

01:34:01.530 --> 01:34:05.690
For the last three
or four censuses,

01:34:05.690 --> 01:34:08.570
when we do a
reapportionment, I've

01:34:08.570 --> 01:34:13.640
sat on that reapportionment
board for about four times

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:19.010
trying to make sure that we
could have our votes protected,

01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:22.100
our rights to vote, and
making our votes count.

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:26.310
And to me, it feels like
I'm always in a battle.

01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:29.750
I'm always in a battle
trying to maintain my rights

01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:30.710
as a citizen.

01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:32.780
And I don't have
all the answers,

01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:34.010
but we just keep trying.

01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:37.408
And we keep trying
to talk to people.

01:34:37.408 --> 01:34:38.450
I don't know the answers.

01:34:41.230 --> 01:34:42.080
- Good morning.

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.090
My name is Ned Bacon.

01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:48.740
Three of four of you are
active participants and deeply

01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:51.080
invested in higher education.

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:53.330
Higher education
particularly in our country

01:34:53.330 --> 01:35:00.380
is a major choke point
to economic citizenship.

01:35:00.380 --> 01:35:05.120
And I'd be very interested in
your three personal thoughts

01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.290
about that as well as maybe
some policy solutions that

01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:17.270
would get our country to a more
public good aspect of education

01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:20.540
the way you see it in places
like Norway and other developed

01:35:20.540 --> 01:35:21.200
economies.

01:35:24.984 --> 01:35:27.350
- Anybody?

01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:30.020
- Well, again, this is
something that we live

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.950
and breathe is education
and higher education.

01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:38.450
And we've attacked it
on different realms.

01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:42.050
Number one, by providing
a lot of scholarships

01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:44.150
from our native corporations.

01:35:44.150 --> 01:35:48.440
And so all of our corporations
have scholarship programs,

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.170
but that's not enough.

01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:54.830
We know that we have a lot
of academic deficiencies.

01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:57.950
And so we spend a lot of our
time teaching-- like math.

01:35:57.950 --> 01:36:01.670
I found out that our native kids
weren't making it into college

01:36:01.670 --> 01:36:02.840
because they couldn't pass.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:07.280
They got into Cal College,
but couldn't pass Math 106.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.580
So we started math
programs all over,

01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.700
teaching, but using
our cultural base.

01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:17.000
So we would teach
math in a basket.

01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.020
We would teach around our
own kinds of technology.

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.600
We would teach math around
the environment, things

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.410
that our children saw and lived.

01:36:27.410 --> 01:36:30.500
We would make it relevant
to their experiences.

01:36:30.500 --> 01:36:32.180
But then we also
found out you know

01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:34.460
that we have to take over
the university system.

01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:38.240
So [LAUGHS] we started
putting our people

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:40.340
on the board of regions.

01:36:40.340 --> 01:36:47.480
And I mean, you have to be
able to control those systems

01:36:47.480 --> 01:36:49.640
to make it work for you.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:54.095
Otherwise, if you don't,
you're going to have--

01:36:54.095 --> 01:36:56.870
well, some of you might like
charter schools and things

01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:57.830
like that.

01:36:57.830 --> 01:37:03.080
I found out that it only goes
for those who have the means

01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:04.640
to go to charter schools.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.400
When we were working
on our education,

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.370
our native teachers
came and said--

01:37:10.370 --> 01:37:12.410
I said, should we start
our own charter school?

01:37:12.410 --> 01:37:13.460
They said, nope.

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.880
You have to work to make
education good for all

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:18.230
of our children.

01:37:18.230 --> 01:37:21.890
And so you have to attack it
at multiple levels for higher

01:37:21.890 --> 01:37:22.650
education.

01:37:22.650 --> 01:37:25.490
This is not only
scholarships, but it's also

01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:31.130
seeing what is preventing our
children from moving forward.

01:37:31.130 --> 01:37:33.980
If it's reintroducing
and changing

01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:39.170
the curricula at the high
school and even earlier.

01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:41.810
We have a Baby
Raven Reads project

01:37:41.810 --> 01:37:44.410
where we're teaching our
children how to read.

01:37:44.410 --> 01:37:47.270
But the other part of it is
also teaching our parents

01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:48.560
how to be good parents.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.000
A lot of our people were taken
and put into boarding schools.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.640
And so they never learned
how to be parents.

01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:59.300
So the school was
something that was--

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:01.680
parenting was kind
of alien to them.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:04.880
And I just can't believe
that for us as native people,

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.890
how we love and
cherish families.

01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:09.440
But we didn't have
the basic mechanics.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.310
So, again, it's
at multiple levels

01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:16.800
that you have to attack
issue of higher education.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.800
- I'll just add really quickly,
the defunding of our higher

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:25.100
education-- so the defunding of
the system of higher education

01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:28.187
the last few decades
has coincided with--

01:38:28.187 --> 01:38:30.020
and it's not a coincidence--
with the moment

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:35.330
at which the cohort of students
attending higher education

01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:37.940
is the most racially
diverse cohort

01:38:37.940 --> 01:38:39.770
in the history of the country.

01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:41.870
And so what you
are actually facing

01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:43.610
is this is one of
those front lines

01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:45.920
for that kind of unequal
membership, I think,

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.648
that we are all talking about.

01:38:47.648 --> 01:38:49.190
What we actually
have now is a system

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:50.930
of higher education
that is highly

01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:53.335
tiered by race and by class.

01:38:53.335 --> 01:38:54.960
When you think about
the ways in which,

01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.690
say, for profit
colleges are subbing

01:38:56.690 --> 01:39:01.010
in for a defunded public
higher education system

01:39:01.010 --> 01:39:06.600
and how extractive those for
profit college mechanisms are.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:10.055
And then when you think about
the way in which by design,

01:39:10.055 --> 01:39:11.930
public policy, especially
the last few years,

01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:15.560
has tried to further defund
the public education system

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.580
and unleash that type of
predatory higher education

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:20.210
policies.

01:39:20.210 --> 01:39:22.190
And so in terms of
solution, I mean,

01:39:22.190 --> 01:39:24.050
I think there's a lot
of-- in the same way

01:39:24.050 --> 01:39:26.340
that there's a big debate
right now about health

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:30.410
care and universal access to
health care, debt free college,

01:39:30.410 --> 01:39:33.440
and tuition free college,
and different ways, I think,

01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:37.530
are a key part of
that policy fight.

01:39:37.530 --> 01:39:39.680
There's a good argument
that the focus really

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:42.320
should be on debt free rather
than just tuition free.

01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:45.020
Because when you add up all
the different ways in which

01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:47.450
the financialized
higher education system

01:39:47.450 --> 01:39:52.880
can create decade's worth
of economic suppression

01:39:52.880 --> 01:39:56.240
for people, especially low
income students and students

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:58.940
of color who have to bear
the burden of student debt

01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:00.110
for the rest of their lives.

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:02.370
We're in a student debt
crisis in this country.

01:40:02.370 --> 01:40:05.850
And that's part of what
needs to be solved.

01:40:05.850 --> 01:40:06.350
- OK.

01:40:09.710 --> 01:40:10.890
- [CLEARS THROAT] Hi.

01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:13.170
My name's Heather Hoffman.

01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:20.430
And I'm here to ask for help
in getting my fellow residents

01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:25.650
of this gorgeous city to believe
that not only is democracy not

01:40:25.650 --> 01:40:30.720
a spectator sport, but
that they should take part.

01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.840
Not just here, but
across the country,

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:37.020
we're turning government
over to private corporations

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.880
in so many ways.

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.560
You can think of things
like athletic stadiums

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.880
where we take people's land so
the government can turn it over

01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:51.600
to a private corporation
that has enough money

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.150
to pay people millions and
millions of dollars a year

01:40:54.150 --> 01:40:56.340
to play.

01:40:56.340 --> 01:41:02.580
Locally, we have things like a
toxic courthouse that is toxic

01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:04.230
not just because of
the toxics in it,

01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:07.470
but toxic because
it's gigantic compared

01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:09.580
to the neighborhood around it.

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:12.103
And the only way the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

01:41:12.103 --> 01:41:13.770
and the city of
Cambridge can figure out

01:41:13.770 --> 01:41:15.870
how to deal with it
is to turn it over

01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:17.160
to a private corporation.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.920
And then because
that's not enough,

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.140
have to turn over
more public property

01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:24.610
to a private corporation.

01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:28.000
And what I see of my fellow
citizens is a whole lot of what

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.330
can we do about it?

01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:32.950
So what are ways
to convince people

01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:35.830
that we deserve to
be treated better

01:41:35.830 --> 01:41:39.420
and that we can demand it?

01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:39.980
- Yeah.

01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:42.240
That's a great question.

01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.470
Two things I'd say.

01:41:43.470 --> 01:41:48.510
I mean, one is that cycle that
you're describing actually even

01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:51.960
starts even further
back with the defunding

01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:55.860
of the kind of public
arena more broadly, right?

01:41:55.860 --> 01:42:00.150
Cut taxes, then there's less
revenue at the city and state

01:42:00.150 --> 01:42:02.880
level, then that forces
a kind of austerity

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.710
for state and local
policies, which

01:42:04.710 --> 01:42:09.150
then seems to require the
privatization [CLEARS THROAT]

01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:13.090
of those things that we think
are central to a public.

01:42:13.090 --> 01:42:16.950
Public schools, public
goods of all kinds.

01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:19.980
And so there's a resource
question at the very back.

01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.450
But the wealth is there.

01:42:21.450 --> 01:42:25.030
It's just now locked away
and hoarded in other pockets,

01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.530
right?

01:42:25.530 --> 01:42:29.100
And so if you add up all the
resources available to us

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:32.070
as a country, it's just
not being channeled

01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:34.200
into public investments.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:38.220
So there's a policy answer
in terms of how to get there.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:40.470
I mean, I'd actually argue
that it's less about people

01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:43.470
being apathetic and
not being interested

01:42:43.470 --> 01:42:45.730
in the issue and
more that people

01:42:45.730 --> 01:42:48.000
don't believe that
we're actually

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.250
going to be able to win, right?

01:42:50.250 --> 01:42:53.970
And that I think
just means zeroing in

01:42:53.970 --> 01:42:57.080
on the kinds of puppet
masters behind the scenes

01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.330
that Zephyr was talking about.

01:42:58.330 --> 01:43:02.340
There are deliberate
class interests

01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:04.710
and corporate interests
at play that benefit

01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:07.020
from a defunded public sector.

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:11.610
And often, lurking behind
many layers of shell companies

01:43:11.610 --> 01:43:12.470
and kind of--

01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:14.910
you have to kind of trace
it all the way back.

01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:17.370
So I think part of
it is identifying who

01:43:17.370 --> 01:43:18.880
the villains are in the story.

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:19.380
All right?

01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:22.290
And then making the
case not just that

01:43:22.290 --> 01:43:24.330
this ought to be
something that we do,

01:43:24.330 --> 01:43:25.975
but that it's
actually achievable.

01:43:25.975 --> 01:43:28.380
And part of what's
potentially exciting I think

01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:29.838
about the debate
we're having right

01:43:29.838 --> 01:43:33.420
now is that there's
a degree of boldness

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:38.370
and an unabashed ambition
about economic policy ideas

01:43:38.370 --> 01:43:40.560
right now, which I
think is pretty unusual

01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.090
and really has to
be leaned into.

01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:44.590
- OK.

01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:47.080
We're unfortunately at time.

01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.720
So in the interest
of time, I think

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:51.450
that's going to have to
be the last question.

01:43:51.450 --> 01:43:53.250
But this is a
conversation that's

01:43:53.250 --> 01:43:56.070
going to continue the rest
of the day at the conference.

01:43:56.070 --> 01:43:59.010
And it's going to continue
outside this conference.

01:43:59.010 --> 01:44:02.820
So please feel free
to continue it.

01:44:02.820 --> 01:44:03.930
I want to do two things.

01:44:03.930 --> 01:44:05.760
My colleague,
Daniel Carpenter, is

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.198
going to talk and say a few
words about what comes next.

01:44:08.198 --> 01:44:10.240
But I also want to thank
our wonderful panelists.

01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:11.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:14.490
