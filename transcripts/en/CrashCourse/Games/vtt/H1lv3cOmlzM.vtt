Hi I'm Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.880
You've got games in your house right?
You know the ones you play on family game night.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.100
Games like Monopoly, Life, or modern ones like Ticket to Ride or Settlers of Catan.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.240
Do you have a drawer, filled with dice?

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.340
Or maybe even have one rolling around in your pocket right now?

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.420
Dice in there.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.480
Well believe it or not, board games and dice games are the result of thousands of years of human development,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.880
and they've led directly to the massive variety of games we play today.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.020
In some ways, that dusty Yahtzee game in the hall closet? That's the end result of human history, man.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:43.040
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.140
Games have been with people from the very beginning of civilization, and probably even earlier than that.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.060
As soon as we dropped from the trees, outran the lions, and put a few buildings together...we got bored.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:01.440
And started playing games. Some estimates put the dawn of games at 5,500 years ago.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.060
Fun fact that actually when they started programming Duke Nukem Forever

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.680
Pretty much every civilisation we've studied, played games. The Ancient Egyptians had Senet.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.260
While the Ancient Chinese had Go. The Romans were playing Backgammon, or Tables, as they called it.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.180
Ancient Aztecs in South America had a game known as Patolli.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.400
I don't know if we can confidently say that games were ubiquitous,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.140
but I am comfortable saying pretty much
everyone in history has played games.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.740
Let's start with what is probably the most ancient of ancient of gaming technology: Dice.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.740
Dice are a part of a lot of games
and to get a little mystical about it:

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.840
Dice symbolize the chance and
randomness involved in many games.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.000
They serve to remind us of the
randomness of the universe.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.080
For thousands of years, dice were actually made from bones, teeth, horns, tusks, and even sheep knuckles.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.460
Sheep knuckles are still used today in Mongolia for both games and fortune telling.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.040
You've heard the phrase "Rolling the bones"? It literally meant bones at one time!

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.080
Now why sheep knuckles? Sheep knuckles are durable, roll well and have four unique sides.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.120
The flat, concave, convex and twisted sides, each side has a recognisable shape, each with their own meanings.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.600
The Greeks called knuckle bones, Astragali and used them to add chance to a game.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Basically it was a way of leaving some parts of the game up to the gods.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.940
But Astragali weren't just for gaming. Remember when I talked about dice as reminders of randomness of the universe?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.220
Well, Ancient Greek fortune tellers and mystics would roll these bones as a way to assign order to some of that randomness.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.380
They used dice to get life advice from the gods. These astragali were seen as messengers of higher authority.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.480
And everything from when to marry, to who will get sick were determined by these little bone fragments bouncing along the floor.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.420
Wonder how they would be at the Powerball?

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.620
Now knucklebones took a long time to become the dice we know today.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.680
Archaeologists have found them in sites dating as far back as 800 BC, though they could probably could go back even further.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.920
Over time, people adjusted and crafted knucklebones into the dice you recognise today.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.860
Slowly the sides were worn down and sculpted.
Symbols and holes were added.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.300
And dice evolved from unique organic bones to uniform plastic cubes with little dots or pips across their surfaces.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.280
Don't worry sheep, your knuckles are safe.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.220
And cubes aren't the only regular
shaped dice evolved into.

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.960
A lot of role-playing games today use the D20 or 20 sided die but its not actually a modern creation.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.480
In 2012, archaeologists discovered a D20 crafted out of serpentine in Egypt dating back to the Ptolemaic Period;

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.360
somewhere between 300 and 30 BCE.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.960
It has Greek letters on various sides, but
no one knows for sure what it was used for.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.540
That could be one really long game of Dungeons and Dragons.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.520
So even though dice and ancient games began to take a more playful nature, the mystical hand of chance

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.800
(not to be confused with the master hand of Super Smash Bros)

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.180
was always present and shaped why and how games were played.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.500
One of the earliest examples of this can be seen in the Ancient Egyptian game of Senet, which roughly translates to "passing."

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.780
The game itself has been found or represented in hieroglyphs from even before the dynastic periods of

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.920
Egypt, around 3,000 to 3,500 BC, and
through the middle and late dynasties.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.160
Senet involved a grid of 30 squares arranged along a rectangular design with 3 rows of 10.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.900
The majority of squares are blank minus several at the end which contained very specific hieroglyphics and symbols.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.380
But with time being time, the exact rules have been lost.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.960
Kind of like when you lose your
instruction manual in a video game.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.380
But through research of temple paintings and hieroglyphic text a solid assumption of the rules has developed.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:37.100
Senet started off as a secular game and there are many hieroglyphic references to drinking wine, playing Senet and calling it a day.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.060
But over time, the game took on a increasing mystical nature.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.480
Senet evolved to indicate how a player
would fare in the afterlife.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.500
The mystical side of gaming had
infiltrated the play side,

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.720
and people would play the game to
see if they were blessed by the gods.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.580
The idea was that a good Senet player
was destined to have a pleasurable afterlife,

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.060
while a player who lost constantly
probably wasn't going to fare that well.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.340
Which seems like a bad deal to me as
I don't know how to play Senet.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.340
But senet was by no means the only ancient game.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.280
All your favourite ancient civilisations played games.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.180
Let's look at Ancient China, where they had the game Wei-Chi or as it is known more commonly, Go.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.700
Some archaeologists estimate that Go
has been played for upwards of 4000 years.

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.780
In fact, it's the oldest game we know of
that's still played in its original form.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.000
The game consists of a solid line grid where players take turns placing either a white or black stone.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.940
The goal of the game is to control or surround the majority of the board.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.680
Go is a little complicated and players
have a lot of possible choices.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.720
And by a lot, I mean there are 10 to the
761st power moves available to a player.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.020
In chess, you only have 10 to the 120th power.
That's a lot chess but you're no Go.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.600
While human chess players have been beaten by computers as far back as the 1980's,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.700
Humans playing Go are just now being
beaten by special computer programs.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.420
Which is pretty impressive for a
4000 year old game.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.380
In South America, Patolli was played across Meso-American cultures.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.760
This game, played between 200 BC and 1000 AD,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.640
was a series of four lines one two axis
that intersected in the middle forming a cross.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.880
The object of the game was for players to move their pieces along the lined tracks based on the throws of beans or stones.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.820
The Aztecs even had a God of Patolli named Xochipilli.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.240
Betting on Patolli was common, and players would bet everything from gold to plants to food to even furniture.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.960
The game was so common and so popular that Aztecs could be seen carrying Patoli mats around with them during the day, just itching for a game.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.400
Huh, it is like the first Gameboy.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.100
This game encompasses the main pillars of ancient games: Fun, mysticism, skill and chance.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.980
No matter the land or people these main themes
keep popping up time and time again.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.120
Thanks Thought Bubble. So a lot of these
ancient games have fallen off of popularity today,

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.640
But all of them illustrate the core principles of fun and engagement that drive people to play games.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.180
These games are the ancestors to
those table top games in our cabinets,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.320
and the video games on our phones and consoles.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.120
And you can still easily buy a copy of
Senet or Backgammon,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.460
and the Honinbo Go tournament in Japan
has a grand prize of over $400,000.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:10.360
These games have staying power.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.540
And trust me -- you figure out a way to add microtransactions to them, they'll be in your phones in no time.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.400
But those aren't the only ancient games that we still play.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.740
Mancala Is more of a game type or mechanic like dice.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.780
But it dates back at least as far as the 4th Century or even further and has survived all that time.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.380
Pretty much in its original form.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.680
Games all over the world, from the
traditional Hao Le Kiswahili in East Africa,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:39.000
and many modern Euro-style board games use the mancala mechanic of transferring a counter along a continuous track.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.780
The familiar children's games shoots and ladders also has ancient origins.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:48.700
And by ancient I mean it goes even further back than 1952, when Milton Bradley introduced the game in the United States.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:54.600
It's based on the game Snakes and Ladders, a game that was bought to England during the 17th Century from India,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.780
where it was played as early as the 2nd Century BC.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.540
In India, the game was played for fun but it also delivered a moral message to the kids who played it.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.480
The ladders were virtues that could lead a player to a higher spiritual state,

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.440
while the snakes represented sins that could drag a person down to a lower plane of being.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:17.620
If you ask me though, the moral message of Shoots and Ladders is a little muddled given that the game is completely random.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:22.360
Or maybe I am missing some deeper message about free will here.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.080
Now this makes for a completely different change of philosophy about Candyland.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.600
The beautiful thing about history is that there is always more to learn.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.200
Archaeologists are digging up previously unknown games all the time.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.880
The Royal game of Ur was discovered in Iraq during the 1920's in a royal tomb.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:44.060
Like a board game from a garage sale, the Royal game of Ur didn't include rules, so archaeologists just made up rules.

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.600
Until the cuneiform tablet was discovered much later.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:52.280
Sadly this rule set was incomplete and there's still a lot of debate among gaming experts as to how to play the game.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:58.920
In 2015, another new game was found in a 2,300 year old tomb in Qingdao city in China.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:08.300
Archaeologists found a handmade 14 sided die made from an animal tooth alongside 21 game pieces with numbers and a broken piece of a game board.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.240
Sound like the beginning of a Goonies sequel,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.920
like, there's one half of the board game piece, we must find the other half and then we will find the treasure!

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:21.740
The game is believed to be called Bo, or Liubo the last time that it was known to be played widely was over 1,500 years ago

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.260
The rules for this game are incomplete like the rules of the Royal game of Ur and your guess on how to play it is as good as mine.

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:30.340
Actually it is probably better than mine, I have no idea how to play it.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:35.880
We could go on and on listing games but we're running out of time. Or your internet attention span.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.100
So we should get to the point of all of this history.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.660
People have been playing games for a long time, and while games have obviously evolved since the days of

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.260
sheep knuckles, mancala, the royal game of Ur, and Senet,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.640
those games, and the mechanics that make them work, are still at the core of the games we play today.

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.120
And it's not just the mechanics of
those games that survived.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:01.400
While we may no longer believe that games can predict kind of afterlife is in store for us, or who we should marry,

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:06.280
the best games can not only forge connections across the small group of friends on game night,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.520
they can connect people over centuries and across continents.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:13.600
And we're still only on our way to having an answer to the question of why we play games.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.860
I think the connection that we feel with each other and with history are clearly a part of it.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.140
Thanks for watching and I'll see you next week.
I gotta go work on my Mortal Kombat game.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.060
*whispers* My afterlife depends on it.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.200
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,
