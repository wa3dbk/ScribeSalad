00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
Hi, I'm André Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:07.300
We've looked at many types of games in this series, from card games to board games to video games,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.960
and all of these games share one common characteristic:

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.160
They require learning.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.720
They teach us the rules of the game world, otherwise we wouldn't be able to play them.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.260
Even a simple game like Rock Paper Scissors requires the players to learn the rules to participate.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.180
But players can also go beyond these basic rules by learning strategies and techniques to increase the likelihood of a win.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.800
So this might mean figuring out which combination of buttons will produce Sub-Zero's Arctic Blast,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.860
or understanding the odds of getting dealt certain cards in a poker game,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.300
or how to grip and release a baseball to throw a curve.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.440
But today we're going to focus on games designed to educate both within and outside the game's world.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.000
Educational games have been around
for thousands of years.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.720
They attempt to balance entertainment and fun with learning, and some have been more successful than others.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.700
So today we're going to focus on a few of the successes in educational gaming, and take a look at what exactly they're doing for us, and how.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:02.880
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:10.240
An educational game is a game explicitly designed to teach its player a skill, like how to add fractions, structure a sentence, or fly an aeroplane.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.180
And these games are designed with the intent to help players apply these concepts outside the gaming universe.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.360
For example, there's this educational game that's a descendant of the 6th century Indian game chaturanga.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.420
This game spread to Persia in around 600 CE and was adopted by Muslims out of the Islamic conquest of Persia.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.540
Eventually, through Moorish conquest of Spain, it spread into Europe and became known as the King's Game.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.300
That's right, we're talking about chess, the world's most popular board game.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:44.520
In 1750, Ben Franklin wrote that chess provided "several very valuable qualities of the mind... including foresight, circumspection, and caution."

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.440
But what does chess teach us?

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.400
Well, when chess stormed Europe in around 1000 CE, it found its place as part of noble life.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.960
The game was used to teach the art of war to young nobility as they believed chess stressed how war could be simplified to a series of direct choices.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.180
Now, it's pretty difficult to prove that the rules of chess can teach us to be better generals,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.060
but a 2000 study on the effects of chess instruction found that there was a strong correlation between learning to play chess and academic achievement.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.640
The researchers found that students who received chess instruction scored significantly higher on all measures of academic achievement, including math, spatial analysis, and non-verbal reasoning.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.700
But not all educational games have to be so serious.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.280
With the arrival of video games, educational games gain a new platform to be engaging, but also fun.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.380
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.760
In 1974, The Oregon Trail was released and it set out to teach children the rigors of the pioneer lifestyle.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.540
It follows the journey of a wagon leader and his group of settlers as they leave Missouri to Oregon's Willamette Valley in 1848.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.400
But The Oregon Trail doesn't just teach players about actual life on the trail.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:54.120
For instance, there is only a set amount of money and players are tasked with choosing the best combination of supplies before starting the journey, teaching players how to manage assets and balance resources.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.180
These mechanics are also applied onto the trail too, like how players decide when to ration resources and trade.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.820
The game also teaches players how to predict the outcomes of their decisions.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.580
For example, they have to choose wisely when to leave.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.300
Too early, and the oxen won't have food, but too late, and the party won't make it to Oregon before winter.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.620
These choices teach players about short- and long-term consequences.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.720
Maybe Auntie May drowns because you're too cheap to pay for the ferry, and try fording the river instead.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.960
Or you set a grueling travel pace, causing the health of your party to slowly deteriorate.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.840
The game even teaches some basic math components, like budgeting money and visualising abstract numbers like the depth and width of a river.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:41.620
The Oregon Trail saw incredible success in schools in the 1970s and 80s, selling an estimated 65 million copies, and was even inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in 2016.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.760
Thanks, Thought Bubble!
Now listen up, Gum Shoes.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.660
I know the widespread educational game is Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego?.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.520
In this game, you track the whereabouts of a series of thieves, the last one being Carmen Sandiego.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.920
Players collect and solve clues about thefts in 30 countries before time runs out.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.820
The game teaches people about geography, world cultures, astronomy, and history through problem solving.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.560
The Carmen Sandiego software series was widely adopted in classrooms, reaching over 300,000 schools across the United States.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.780
It has even been awarded over 90 educational and parent awards.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.940
Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego? spawned a series of sequels.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.460
We had Where In Time Is Carmen Sandiego? in my school.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.360
It also had books, tabletop games, an animated series.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.200
And it also inspired an educational game show on PBS that ran for five seasons, attracting 5.5 million weekly viewers,

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.100
winning its own fair share of awards,
and giving us a catchy theme song from Rockapella.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.540
[singing] Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.600
And educational games have greatly helped those that have struggled with math.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.720
Two games stand out -- Math Blaster and my personal favourite, Number Munchers.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.120
The original Math Blaster came out in 1983, but it would be the remake in 1989 that was widely played in classrooms.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.920
You see?
Not all remakes are bad.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.560
The main hero, Blasternaut, and his robot buddy, Spot, had to save the universe by solving math problems, bringing them across multiple levels.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.060
It was an exciting space adventure designed for players to practice simple math concepts through arcade-style play.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.580
Number Munchers was released in 1986 to teach basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.020
Players were presented with a grid of numbers and an objective to consume.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.020
To advance, players had to eat the correct answers to the questions, like "divisible by 2" or "prime numbers",

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.480
while dodging Troggles, which were troll-like characters that moved around the board changing numbers.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.700
And if they hit you, they would make this sound like this.
[makes weird noise]

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.720
Players were given breaks in between levels with cutscenes, just like those seen in Pac-Man.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.120
Games like these were popular in classrooms.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.900
Eric Klopfer, author of Augmented Learning: Research and Design on Mobile Educational Games, said,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.540
"These games were so successful because parents and teachers pushed for them because it was easy to see what students were learning, and that they were learning."

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.680
"And students wanted them too because they were fun!"

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.640
That brings us to the impact these games have on ourselves and our learning.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:57.640
A 2014 study by University of Rochester Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Daphne Bavelier found that action gamers excel at many tasks because they are better learners.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.940
The researchers claimed and showed that playing action games expands our preparedness for performing daily tasks.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:11.920
The study further found that when faced with a new perceptual learning task, action gamers performed the same as non-action gamers, but showed an accelerated learning curve.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.520
The researchers tested players a few months later and found that action gamers still performed better than the control group.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.720
So basically, the study argues that people who play games are able to learn new concepts more quickly.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:28.700
And game-based learning also provides an educational environment much different from the rote memorisation common in classrooms.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.220
According to Dr Susan Ambrose, Director of Carnegie Mellon's Eberly Centre for Teaching Excellence,

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:39.980
educational games allow people to actually test the lessons they have learned, helping them retain the information as well as know how to use it in real life.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.700
And Dr Ambrose's research also shows that good educational games allow learners to remain engaged with the material until it is mastered.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.660
These games allow them to work through concepts and make mistakes in a risk-free setting.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.580
In other words, games provide excellent environments for learning because players don't have to worry about failing.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.460
And these games do play a big part in our education system.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.900
In 2008, PEER Research Centre claimed that one-third of all American students have played an educational game as a school assignment.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.680
So whether you're learning a strategy with chess and The Oregon Trail, munching numbers,

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.200
or learning geography with Carmen Sandiego, educational games play an important role.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.660
Moreso than most games, actually, because they so heavily influence what we learn and how we apply those skills in our real lives.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.440
And not only are you learning something, you're also having a good time.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.040
Have you ever played two-player Donkey Kong Jr Math?

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.340
It's actually more fun than you think.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.120
And by the size of the educational game catalogue on your smart phones, educational games are more prevalent than ever.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.380
Now, if you'll excuse me, I gotta learn some geography because Mario is missing.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:37.080
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:43.360
