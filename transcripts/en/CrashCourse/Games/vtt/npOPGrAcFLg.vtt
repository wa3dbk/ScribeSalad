00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games. Last week we focused on the dawn of

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.430
the video game industry, and the early dominance
of the Atari, but Atari didn’t exist in a vacuum.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.620
There were many other companies vying for players quarters, and trying to get their consoles into players’ homes.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.220
Home consoles allowed for video games to integrate
deeply into people’s lives,

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.690
and were important to the evolution of the
industry and the artform.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.620
So if we’re going to get a handle on early
video game history,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.080
we’re going to have to look at the rest of the video game industry during the funky 1970s. Can you dig it.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.040
Now although Atari did come to dominate the
competition with their beloved 2600,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.780
Atari didn’t invent the home video game
console.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.860
Game historians generally point to the Magnavox Odyssey as the early pioneer in getting games onto home televisions.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.579
The Odyssey was the brain-child of a man named Ralph Baer, who’s been called the Father of Video Games,

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.159
not to be confused with Nolan Bushnell who has been called The Father of the Video Gaming Industry.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.080
Ralph Baer was born in Germany in 1922, migrated to America, and began a lifelong love affair with technology.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.720
In 1951, Ralph conceived an idea for an interactive
TV device.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.440
But he couldn’t get his employers interested
in the idea.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.900
But like any good unappreciated genius
he struggled on for the next 15 years,

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.840
until he was able to make his dream a reality.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.980
By 1966, prices for televisions had fallen, and TVs were in over 40 million homes in the United States.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.800
Once Baer’s idea finally started moving, like a lot of developments in early video gaming, things happened fast.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.340
He drew up schematics for a new console in
a less than a week,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.120
and his employers were impressed enough to
assign a small development team to the project.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.520
By 1967, the team had a working table tennis
game, that would later go on to inspire Atari’s Pong.

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:52.729
They called the system the Brown-Box and began
shopping it around to large manufacturers.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.400
They eventually licensed the technology to the Magnavox corporation, and the Odyssey appeared in stores in 1972.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.260
Now the Odyssey wasn’t a game system as
we think about them today.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.819
Rather than using game software that runs
on a computer, like later consoles,

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.419
the Odyssey’s "games" were really just electrical
connectors in a massive circuit between the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.780
television and the system.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.530
The Odyssey featured game cards that were
inserted into the machine,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.090
which closed different loops in the giant
circuit, and changed the output to the television.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.570
The games were all very similar, and
extremely simple by today's standards,

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.870
but at the time, they were kind of amazing.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.400
While the Odyssey was simple, it was also
revolutionary,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.420
and it launched with a lot of features that
would become standard in video consoles.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.879
It featured one of gaming’s earliest commercial
light guns, allowing players to shoot at their

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.120
“screen” and hunt dinosaurs and ghosts.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.569
The Odyssey’s development team also determined
that game systems should be hooked up to TVs,

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.329
and presented on channels 3 or 4, which became the console industry’s standard procedure for decades.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.349
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, The Odyssey was
groundbreaking, and amazing, and inspirational,

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.439
but it was quickly improved upon and subsequently
forgotten.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:03:01.499
Atari’s Video Computer System or VCS 2600 hit the market in 1977, and once again revolutionized home gaming.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.560
The Atari 2600 was a massive improvement over
the Magnavox Odyssey.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.920
The console was the first to feature two joysticks, which made home gaming feel more like playing in an arcade.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.880
The games were also much more graphically
complex, and they were in color! Just like real life!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.280
Look at those graphics! That looks, like,
real! Real world right there on my TV!

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.600
Adventure set the standard for the exploratory
game genre and influenced video games like

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.629
The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Tomb
Raider.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.980
Adventure also contained the first “Easter
Egg”, or hidden feature.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.260
At the time, Atari’s leadership didn’t
give individual designers and developers any

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.009
sort of public facing credits for the games
they made.

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:42.100
Those unskippable credit rolls at the end
of games, they weren’t a thing yet.

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.289
The game’s designer, Warren Robbinett,
didn’t like the lack of recognition,

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.529
so he built a room into the game with his name in it.

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:52.469
This took up 5% of his game’s overall storage;
not insignificant.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.600
That “feature” stayed hidden from the
non-crediting jerks in Atari management until

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.310
after the game had sold hundreds of thousands
of copies, and a young player wrote a letter

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.709
asking about the message.
Spoiler alert: the developer didn’t get fired.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.689
And in the decades since, designers have
been hiding small surprises in their games,

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.520
and players have been delighted in finding them.

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.439
Another thing Atari helped introduce to gaming
culture was third-party developers.

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.620
Several disgruntled key employees from Atari
left the company.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.549
They were upset at the lack of recognition,
unless they pulled a Warren Robbinett and

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.949
put their name in the game as an Easter Egg,
and because they also weren’t happy with

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.060
how the company was managed.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.900
They founded Activision, the first outside company
that developed games for the Atari 2600.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.280
This is now standard practice in the video
game world.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.000
Actually Activision is still doing it themselves
with games like Call of Duty and Skylanders.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.139
While Atari had the dominant home console,
it was not alone in the video game market.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:44.699
Toy company Mattel got into the act and released
the Intellivision in 1979.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.160
While it was able to grab some of Atari’s market share, it never managed to overtake the 2600.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.100
But the Intellivision system was known for
its improved graphics and sound quality.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.560
But the system’s controllers, that looked
like calculators, literally they had numbers on them,

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.160
they have been called some of the most uncomfortable controllers ever made.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.080
Sorry Intellivision, I’m just keeping it 100. Which I can actually type on your calculator-looking controller.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.660
Now here is where it starts getting nasty:
Mattel put up a strong marketing fight against Atari

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.389
by showing side-by-side comparison ads with
political commentator George Plimpton.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.271
These were some of the first ads to directly
tout the supremacy of one system over another.

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.540
Something I think we’re going to see again
in the future.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.900
And while Mattel’s console was always second string, the company did contribute some genuine gaming innovations.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.700
In 1977, the company released one of the first
hand-held games, Mattel Electronics’ Football,

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.500
an ancestor to the many handheld
gaming devices that followed,

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:42.360
like GameBoys, Nintendo 3DS, Game Gear, Atari Lynx.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.320
See Mattel you were better than Atari in the
mobile market.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.660
By 1978 Mattel was selling upwards to 500,000
of these handheld games per week.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.060
Gaming had been brewing across the Pacific
in Japan for some time,

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.169
and an invasion of the alien landed in America.
Thanks to Space Invaders.

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.240
Designed by 34yr old Tomohiro Nishikado, made by Taito of Japan, and released in America in 1978 by Midway.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.040
Space invaders was a massive hit in arcades,
and demand for home versions of it helped

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.460
spur on the success of the Atari console.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.740
Space Invaders was the first official licensing of an arcade game and this quadrupled the Atari 2600’s sales.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:24.650
Space Invaders was one of the early successes
for a Japanese game in the American market,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.659
but it would by no means be the last.

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:31.490
Space Invaders’ success foreshadowed the
future success of Japanese gaming giants like

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.750
this one company you might have heard of them,
um, Sega.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.880
And there was this other company before that, uh, you might of heard of it, I don’t know, named Nintendo.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.220
Does that ring a bell? You know what we’ll
get into that next time. Thanks for watching.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.300
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacy Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.480
