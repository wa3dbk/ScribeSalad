00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
Hi, I'm André Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.820
So we ended the last episode with more connected consoles

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.760
and we'll see improved specs and deeper integration in these platforms throughout the next decade.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.880
But today we're going to take a look at the larger cultural shifts that were happening in gaming.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.920
As we've seen, gaming constantly evolves with new technologies, just like Pokemon.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.360
And over the last decade, there has been an explosion of technologies

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.240
that have allowed games to infiltrate all areas of our lives.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.320
We now have games on our phones, in our schools, basically anywhere we have an internet connection.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.740
Many of us walk around with a library of games at our literal fingertips.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.240
These games have challenged
the industry that spawns them.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.600
Players are no longer tied to the table
or to the TV to play games.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.180
Today, we're going to talk about social and mobile gaming and how they have led to a shift towards casual gaming.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.960
So pull up your phone and your tablet, log into your favorite social network, and let's explore what gaming has done to link us all together.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.840
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.480
With 1.09 billion daily active users as of March 2016,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.700
Facebook and other social networks have become one of the premier places for people to connect with others.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.940
And just like real life gathering places, these social networks eventually became a shared space for play.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.920
Now, many games can be called "social", but the social games we're going to be talking about today have a few distinct, though rapidly changing, standards.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.460
Currently, social games are games that primarily take place over an online social network,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.020
usually accessed via a computer or other device like the kind of games you find on Facebook.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.860
Social games almost always involve users' social contacts as part of gameplay.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.900
They require socialisation activities like trading and they often don't demand synchronous gameplay.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.140
That is, players don't necessarily have to be playing the game at the same time to participate.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.120
Typically, these games also don't have a true ending or victory but instead encourage perpetual play.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.020
But any game that relies on a network of users to operate can be a social game.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.940
So games that have their own smaller, contained networks within apps could be considered social games too, like those on your mobile phone.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.280
Now, social games can be mobile games, but not all mobile games are social games.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.540
Technically, mobile games are found on phones, tablets, and other mobile devices like smart watches.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.440
Usually, they are more intricate than social games, but more limited in scope than larger PC or console games.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.180
They sometimes use infrared, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth to connect players

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.720
and mobile games generally rely on touch screen technology for all major interactions as opposed to controllers used for console games.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.260
According to the Entertainment Software Association, as of 2014, roughly 30% of mobile games are social games.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.340
Combined, mobile and social games are a form of casual gaming, which refers to the actual duration of gameplay.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.620
Unlike console games that typically require up to 50+ hours to complete in sustained multi-hour sessions

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.500
casual games only require a few minutes of sustained play to finish a mission, collect an item, or tidy up the game space.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.000
Sure, players can play casual games for a much longer total time if they often lack definitive endings, particularly in social games.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.920
But often these games are even designed to force smaller bouts of play with timed events.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.420
Like in Candy Crush, when you only get a limited number of times to play before you have to come back and play again.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.100
Or in Smurf Village -- you build a house, but you gotta wait for an hour before it's done.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.900
Timed events force players to wait to play and come back to play.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.860
However, they alternatively encourage the player to continue playing by paying a fee or promoting the game to a friend.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.020
We'll get into that in a little bit.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.400
But not all casual games are mobile games.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.620
With the introduction of many shorter indie game titles and party games found on consoles like Nintendo Wii

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.360
the casual gaming market was showing up more and more in home consoles

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.600
and the definition of casual gaming starts to get a little blurry.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.240
But is the point is, casual games have become an integral part of gaming culture.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:40.660
Since 2010, social gaming alone has seen a 71% increase, with an estimated 510 million people playing online.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.560
81 million of those people log in and play at least once a day

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.020
and 49 million of them play multiple times throughout the day.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:54.520
And casual games have become one of the fastest growing game genres. As of 2016, mobile and social games held nearly half of the video game market.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.380
So how did social games become so popular?

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.360
Well, Facebook launched in 2004 with no games whatsoever

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.940
and it wasn't until 2009 that they began to pop up on the site and notifications popped up in your inbox.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.800
Early games like Happy Farm, Farm Town, and Barn Buddy were heralds for what was to come

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.060
and I think you may know what game we're going to talk about next.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.560
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.080
The company Zynga created a social gaming phenomenon with Farmville.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.880
This simple game of raising animals and harvesting crops with the help of your friends

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.120
rapidly grew to over 10 million players within six weeks of its debut

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.420
and within a year, that number had risen to 80 million players.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.860
Farmville capitalised on its social component by encouraging users to contact their Facebook friends

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.520
to help as farm hands to complete tasks more quickly

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.380
and it also rewarded players with in-game currency for helping out other players.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.800
Although this message spamming was
exasperating to many non-players,

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.180
Zynga claims Farmville has lead to 752,000 players' first dates and 280,000 marriage proposals.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.700
Time to change your relationship status!

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.580
Farmville's success helped launch
the popularity of social games,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.300
and companies were quick to mimic it with games like Mafia Wars, Cityville, and Island Paradise.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.960
These games helped popularise the free-to-play model that was introduced in the MMOs of the late 90s.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.140
Free-to-play games don't cost anything to get the software and play.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.860
They relied on ads for revenue and often used in-game currency that could be purchased through, that's right, micro-transactions.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:17.120
Players tend to spend more money over time with micro-transactions than with subscription fees

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.700
but the majority of players never spend anything at all.

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.380
The vast majority of revenue for social games comes from die-hard players

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.020
(sometimes referred to, hopefully affectionately, as whales)

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.480
but the rest of the players do have value, as their numbers are used to set ad rates for in-game advertising.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.680
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.760
So games like Farmville were, of course, profitable, but they also provided a social component unlike many other games of the time.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.100
Social games encouraged shared interaction to complete challenges, chat windows for communication,

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.260
and, of course, real opponents or teammates for less predictable and more engaging gameplay.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.800
Social games are also composed of a player's community of "friends"

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.700
and tend to have much simpler gaming mechanics which encourage much broader participation.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.100
That's why your grandma keeps sending you those Farmville requests.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.400
While social games are getting popular on Facebook, mobile games are getting popular on our iPhones and Androids.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.040
Nearly 85% of the mobile app market revenue in 2015 was from games.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.180
That's about $35 billion.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.320
And these mobile games carried many social gaming principals with them.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.580
For example, in 2009, a feathered flock of angered avians descended from their perches onto the world of gaming.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.260
One of the most popular games of the mobile genre, Rovio's Angry Birds, became another modern gaming phenomenon.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.280
Angry Birds was an instant hit.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:34.020
As of 2015, there were over 3 billion downloads of some version or special edition of Angry Birds across all known platforms.

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.240
The mobile battalions, the toys, board games, Star Wars, Transformers, a feature film, and multiple theme parks -- Angry Birds has become a main-stay in popular culture.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.540
And this is no accident.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.340
Rovio claims that there were many previously failed mobile games

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.160
and it learned that people need to be able to play the game right away and in short bursts.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.040
Players wanted a game they could easily pick up and put down, basically what now defines a casual game.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.160
Angry Birds also offered the free-to-play model we talked about with social games

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.040
and allowed players the opportunity to unlock extra features for a price.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.700
Again with the micro-transactions.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.960
And interestingly, in 2012, Rovio released Angry Birds on Facebook, integrating more social components within the game

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.120
such as in-game purchases and the ability for players to compete in tournaments among friends

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.160
further muddying the line between social and mobile gaming.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:24.840
So games like Farmville, Candy Crush, and Panda Pop -- I hadn't even heard of Panda Pop -- have become an integral part of many players' daily lives.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.440
But why are these games so popular?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.120
Of course, there is the social component of playing games with friends.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.360
Also, the simple mechanics have encouraged much broader adoption

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.580
and mobile games do tap into some psychological principles found in addictions.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.720
These short games allow for succinct positive feedback for the player.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.980
An easy win makes us feel great and urges us to repeat the action.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.260
A loss in, particularly, a game that looks like an easy win makes us feel angry and urges us to repeat the action.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.060
This was evident in games like Flappy Bird.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:56.200
If you remember, in February 2014, the creator of Flappy Bird removed his app from the Apple and Android stores

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.380
because he thought the game was too addictive.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:00.800
And then people made clones of it.
And I'm still addicted.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.280
According to Mark Griffiths, the director of the International Gaming Research Unit in Nottingham Trent University,

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.620
mobile games are, in many ways, like slot machines.

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.740
When they become predictable, they become boring

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.740
but if they are random, but still possible to win, they encourage persistence of play.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.240
And there's a lot more we could say about the psychology of why we play games but we'll get into that in a future episode.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.580
So, as you can see, gaming continues to follow us through our latest technologies

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.520
and with the introduction of casual gaming through mobile and social games, more and more people are playing games

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.720
and gaming itself as a genre is getting hard to define.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.620
It's no longer limited to just arcades, consoles, and computers -- gaming is now everywhere we go,

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.080
making it part of our regular social interactions and prevalent in our daily lives.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.020
But as you PC gamers know, casual gaming isn't the only place where communities were forming around games.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:47.720
Next week, we're going to talk about MMORPGs and the communities that have formed around these players.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.480
And with that, I'll let you get back to your game of Candy Crush, Monster Legends and Cross Road.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.760
Thanks for watching, see you next time.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.580
Ooh, 500 gems for $4.99!

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.340
Purchase...

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.780
Don't judge me.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.080
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.800
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.680
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.380
