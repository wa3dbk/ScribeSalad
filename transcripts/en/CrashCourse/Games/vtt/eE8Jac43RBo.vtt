00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Hi, I'm André Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:06.160
So we close out the 1990s with the Sony PlayStation leading the market

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.300
and Nintendo the only other real contender.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.080
And by 2001, following the commercial disaster of the Dreamcast, Sega had completely exited the console industry.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.140
But as one company stopped making consoles, a new company took its place.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.500
Microsoft was about to enter the market and gaming was about to get connected to the internet.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.260
Whew, good thing we survived Y2K for that.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:34.060
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.860
In March of 2000, Sony, who was already dominating the market, released the PlayStation 2.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.680
The system itself was light years ahead of its predecessor.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.500
It was a 128-bit system and stored its games on DVDs and CDs.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.400
It also had backwards compatibility,  which meant that it could play the large library of existing software from the original PlayStation.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.460
A common problem in the industry is game mortality.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.300
Technology evolves and players are left with a bunch of old games they can no longer play.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.520
Publishers might rewrite or port some old games to the new systems

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.200
but for the most part, people had to keep their old consoles or just live without playing their beloved copy of Nascar Thunder 94.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.740
The PlayStation 2's backward compatibility solves this problem and won a lot of consumer approval

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.380
by allowing players to play new PS2 games while still being able to play their old PS1 games all on the same system.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.220
And the switch from CD-ROM to a DVD drive was also pretty important.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.220
The maximum storage for a PlayStation game grew from 700 megabytes on CDs to as large as 8.5 gigabytes with the new format.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.820
This allowed developers to work on longer, richer and more complex games

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.500
without having to stretch the game across multiple disks the way they did with Final Fantasy VII.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.920
Since the PlayStation 2 had a DVD-ROM in it, that meant you could also play DVDs on it.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.080
Kinda similar to how on the PlayStation 1, you could play video games or your Backstreet Boys and Spice Girls CDs.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.560
It was the 90s.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.620
This was the early start of seeing game consoles as more than just game consoles

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.260
but full multimedia entertainment devices.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.240
And the PlayStation 2 offered a way to connect to the internet, but it wasn't very straightforward.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.240
Consumers had to purchase an adaptor and an additional memory card to go online.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.500
The servers didn't even have a name in 2002, but it allowed for multiplayer match-ups and additional content within certain games.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.840
But, as is the way with these things, the tech was pretty cool but it was the PlayStation 2's games that helped it succeed.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.060
Games like Grand Theft Auto III.
It was one of the first 3D open worlds.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.160
Sure, you could follow the constructed missions, but you were also free to do whatever you wanted.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.500
For example, you could just choose to steal cars and listen to the radio

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.840
which was sort of like a real radio station with a talk show and licensed albums from real musicians.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.300
You could also run away from the cops, beat up random citizens, just do whatever.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.160
IN THE GAME.
Don't do this stuff in real life.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.460
But a game where you can do almost anything -- and I do mean ANYTHING -- did have its critics.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Game Spy called it the Game of the Year in 2001

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.180
and also awarded it the less coveted Most Offensive Game of the Year Award.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.840
The ESRB gave it a mature rating for violence and sexual content

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.500
and the game was banned in Australia,
where there was no "adults only" rating.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.820
But, despite the controversy, it was still the biggest selling video game in the US in 2001 and still makes titles to this day.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.260
The PlayStation 2 would go on to be the best selling gaming console of all time.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.560
As of March 2012, the last time Sony released its numbers, it had sold over 155 million units

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.340
and its library of games -- more than 1900 titles.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.140
And the PlayStation 2 console was an active product that Sony supported for nearly thirteen years

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.040
making it one of the longest-lived consoles of all time.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.980
In fact, the last server on the PlayStation 2 was shut off this year, 2016.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.680
So the PlayStation 2 was a pretty big deal but it was about to get some major competition.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.120
In January of 2001, Bill Gates and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson debuted the Xbox at the Consumer Electronics Show.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.540
Microsoft's console, the Xbox, was the first by an American company since the sales of the Atari Jaguar stopped in 1996.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.420
And the Xbox made all the standard technological improvements -- building a faster, higher capacity machine than the previous consoles.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.580
But it was that integrated ethernet port and the network that Microsoft would launch

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.860
that led to some significant changes both inside and outside the console industry.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.400
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.260
Microsoft had designed its Xbox with a plan to move online, which is exactly what it did on its one-year anniversary.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.520
In 2002, Xbox Live launched, and more than 150,000 subscribers signed up in its first week.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.480
The system was a unified network where players could connect and compete with other players all over the world.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.820
Players could speak to each other and co-ordinate strategy with the new voice chat system.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.940
The network also allowed them to download new maps and other content for their games.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.940
Microsoft released its Xbox with Halo: Combat Evolved.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.100
It was a critical and commercial success.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.560
By 2005, the game had sold over five million copies worldwide.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.900
Video game journalist Steven Curran called it "the most important launch game for any console ever"

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.240
and that it surpassed Goldeneye as a new standard for multiplayer combat.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.140
But Halo launched before Xbox Live was finished and would never support online multiplayer matches.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.580
But it did support a feature called System Link

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.200
which allowed players to connect up to four consoles together like a LAN network -- like PC users have been doing for years --

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.620
to have up to 16-player deathmatches.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.240
But Halo 2 launched in 2004 and delivered on the promise of Halo's great multiplayer experience and the potential of the Xbox Live network.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.100
Halo 2's system was pretty great at matching players against other gamers with similar skill levels

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.700
and the game was really designed for online multiplayer.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.480
With this online matchmaking, players had the chance to get good -- like, REALLY good --

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:33.020
and some of these players would eventually take part in the first US professional league of Major League Gaming

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.200
which hosted its first televised league tournament in 2006, playing Halo 2. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.560
So professional gaming, or electronic sports (or e-sports), were on the rise all over the world

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.800
with the help of online multiplayer from PCs and now also from Xbox.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.640
But at the same time, Microsoft was making some games for players who didn't want to pay that monthly subscription

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.680
or just wanted the single-player experience.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.420
Like 2004's Fable.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.560
Fable included a morality alignment system that encouraged players to make moral choices within the game.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.040
Completely opposite from Grand Theft Auto III, player's decisions in Fable now had real consequences

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.840
and the choices to help or hurt non-player characters in the game would be reflected in the onscreen character appearance

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.640
and the non-player characters definitely remembered if you murdered someone in their town.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.940
They were less likely to help known thieves and killers.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.120
Meanwhile, Nintendo had its own entry in this Console War -- the Nintendo GameCube.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.260
It debuted in 2001 and was the first Nintendo system to deliver its software on disks rather than cartridges.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:36.200
But instead of using standard five-inch DVDs like Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo chose the unusual mini-DVD format.

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.620
Look at you, you're so tiny.

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.680
Now, these disks couldn't hold as much data as DVDs but they did make piracy more difficult for Nintendo games.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.060
And, like Sony, the GameCube supported limited online gaming with an adaptor.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.580
Nintendo's next console, the Wii, would have a few games with online multiplayer

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:57.880
but Nintendo would not fully adopt an online service like the Xbox until the Wii U console in 2012.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.280
But we're just talking home consoles.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.680
Nintendo also developed the DS handheld system in the early 2000s.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.940
The Game Boy had been around since 1989.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:10.040
There had been several evolutions of the handheld platform, like the Game Boy Colour, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy SP

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.300
but it was the DS, or Dual Screen, that was revolutionary.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.640
The top screen displayed the game while the bottom was a touch screen

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.180
which allowed developers to include novel control schemes in their titles.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.560
And it supported WiFi, continuing the trend toward connected gaming.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:33.120
And Nintendo had one more major exclusive that debuted in 2001 on the GameCube -- Super Smash Brothers Melee!

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:38.460
The four-player free-for-all fighting game was a vast improvement to the Nintendo 64 original

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.240
with more Nintendo fighters and a finely tuned and balanced fighting mechanic system.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.520
Melee was so well-received that it would become a standard in professional gaming

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.340
and these tournaments, like the FPS tournaments of Halo, were indicative of a larger shift in the industry.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.160
So whether playing in groups and gaming tournaments or LAN parties or playing at home online

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.880
more and more gamers were being connected with and playing real players.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:04.680
Players were getting more competitive and forming massive communities within these games

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.700
and we'll get into this a little bit more when we talk about MMORPGs

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.980
but this internet access was giving players and gamer culture a new home.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.060
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.240
And make sure you pay your internet bill so you can keep watching this show and playing those games.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.420
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.360
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.160
If you'd like to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:31.980
