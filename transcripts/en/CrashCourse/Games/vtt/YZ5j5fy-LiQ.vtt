00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
Hi, I'm André Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.460
Today, we're going to talk about a new kind of game that appeared in the 1990s

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.240
and leveraged the new internet technology to connect millions of players in the gaming world

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.980
where they can talk to each other, work toward completing quests, and compete or co-operate as they please.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.040
These games are called Massively Multiplayer Online Roleplaying Games

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.800
which is too long of a phrase for me to say fourteen more times in this video, so we're just gonna call them MMORPGs.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.120
Games like these, usually found on PCs, have been nicknamed "life-games" since they lack a traditional ending.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.020
You could literally play them for life.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.200
Or at least as long as the servers are up, anyway.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.300
Today, we're gonna talk about a few of these fantasy worlds and find out why they bring us together in the real world.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.860
So slap on that tier 18 armour and grab your companion pet, make sure your expansion pack is downloaded, and let's go!

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:51.220
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.140
In the world of gaming, we have Massively Multiplayer Online Games (or MMO games) and Roleplaying Video Games (or RPGs).

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.060
MMORPGs are obviously the combination of them both.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.900
These games are usually hosted on servers by the game's publishers and are constantly evolving whether the player is online or not.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.520
But before we get into that, let's talk about MUD.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.160
I don't mean mud like the kind your dog tracks in, but a MUD, or Multi-User Dungeon, which would go on to inspire modern MMORPGs.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.920
MUDs are text-based roleplaying games that have no graphics and only involve a few users.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.860
Players type in questions or commands and the game responds with written responses.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.740
Using your imagination and pretending to see the adventure is a selling point.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.560
These games are usually fantasy-based and most were inspired by Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.660
One of the most famous MUDs, called MUD, was created in the late 1970s by Roy Trubshaw on a PDP-10.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.220
We mentioned that in an earlier episode because that's the same computer used for the invention of Galaxy Game, the world's first coin-operated video game.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.480
MUD was simple, with players typing in N, E, S, or W for the four main directions, and words like "attack" or "defend" to battle enemies.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.940
A few years later, those simple commands were replaced with more complex sentences like, "You were eaten by a Grue!"

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.480
a famous phrase that many players of the game Zork encountered time and time again.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.880
This popular MUD sold over 680,000 copies in the first three games in its series in the 1980s.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.580
These games emphasised leveling-up, exploration, and monster hunting, which would become a common theme in many future MMORPGs.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.060
But text-based games have a limited audience because people like pretty pictures

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.320
and in 1986, Lucasfilm Games debuted Habitat on the Commodore 64.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:31.300
This game could support up to 10,000 players, but users could only play the game at night and on weekends when the server was running.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.040
It's like an old cellphone plan.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.200
Also, players had to play by the hour.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.880
It's like old long distance charges.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:44.720
In 1991, Quantum Computer Services (which would later be called AOL) debuted Neverwinter Nights, which was the first modern MMORPG.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.500
By the time it went offline in 1997, it supported 115,000 players that paid $6 an hour to enter that world.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.620
It had fighting, leveling-up, and the ability to create guilds, or like-minded groups within the game.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.900
This would become a cornerstone of modern MMORPGs and the communities created within them.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.120
In 1997, Ultima Online was the MMORPG that brought this game genre to the mainstream

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.000
reaching 100,000 subscribers in its first year and a peak user base of 250,000 active accounts in 2003.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.960
It helped that the Ultima series had been around since 1981, had 10 titles in its series, and had a huge fanbase.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.300
So this brings us to that quintessential modern MMORPG -- World of Warcraft!

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:32.040
World of Warcraft, or WoW, has been running since 2004 and, at its height, had over 12 million active players.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.760
This game is so widespread that it's played in 244 countries and territories

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.420
and its players have created over 500 million characters and 9 million social guilds.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.100
Today, WoW still has 5.5 million players, which isn't too bad considering those players are still paying Blizzard $15 a month to play the game.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.480
And the bonds people form in the game can even spill over into real life.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.060
The New York Times ran an article in 2011 documenting multiple couples who met and married thanks to World of Warcraft.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.260
And even death is also an accepted part of gaming in WoW communities.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.600
In 2006, a World of Warcraft player died of a stroke in real life.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.060
Her online friends chose to honour her with an in-game funeral.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.440
A huge number of players showed up in formal attire and left their weapons at home out of respect.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.660
A line formed so that mourners could pay their last respects to the player's avatar.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.540
But since this is a game on the internet, things went horribly wrong when an opposing faction's guild raided the funeral and killed everyone.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.560
It's a real event and one that questions the boundaries between the game world and the real world and the realm of human decency.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.940
So games like WoW can say a lot about us as people, but what do they say about the systems and institutions we create?

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.040
MMORPGs have created micro-economies that have helped economists model how these systems can be adjusted for the real world.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.180
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.680
Eve Online is a great example of a game as a microcosm of societal institutions.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.200
This sci-fi space opera released in 2003 has an economy almost completely driven by players.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.460
Eve Online has such a dynamic economy that in 2007, they hired Dr. Eyjolfur Guomundsson to be the game's lead economist.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:06.200
He and his team acted as the game's National Economics Institute, Statistics Office, and Central Bank.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:11.640
Describing his job as "any economist's dream, because this is not just an experiment, this is more like a simulation.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.800
More like a fully-fledged system where you can input to see what happens."

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.840
In Eve Online, there are more than 5,000 items players can buy and sell,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.760
and over 1 million transactions happen each day using in-game currency known as ISK, or Interstellar Kredits.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:32.660
As of 2014, there are around 600 trillion ISK in the game which translated to around $18 million real world US dollars.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.780
But since that was all player-made and tied to the creation of economic value,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.740
the gamemakers could not act as a government and infuse the economy with fresh cash

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.480
so Dr Guomundsson had to find more subtle ways of balancing out the economy, like implementing broker fees, selling player skill books

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.220
and imposing sales tax on in-game transactions to avoid hyperinflation.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.480
Also, Dr Guomundsson believes that Eve Online can be used to study monetary systems

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.900
by looking at how everything from the Gold Standard to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin can function on a grand level within the game.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.560
And here we thought the game was all just about building ships and blowing them up.

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.780
Thanks, Thought Bubble!
And speaking of building ships and blowing them up,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.240
Eve Online has made history for having one of the biggest and most costly in-game online battles of all time.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.600
You see, spaceship costs in the game can be translated to real world money,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.940
with the smallest worth around $1 to $13 US dollars and the largest as much as $7,600.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.700
And just so we're clear, those values are based on the average hourly pay within the game across all players which can be converted to US dollars

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.280
because players can use real money OR in-game currency to purchase and trade play time.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.820
So in 2014, a battle that would become known as Bloodbath of B-R5RB raged over two days.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:48.420
And when it ended, there was over 11 trillion ISK worth of damage, or $330,000 real world dollars.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.460
Now, players can make money inside the games, so most of that money wasn't spent from actual players' wallets,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.860
but still, that's a lot of subscription time.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.280
But real money is constantly going into these games.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.840
Players routinely sell, buy, and trade gaming aspects from this game and others, even though it's forbidden.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.820
This is on top of the subscription, or pay-to-play business models.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.000
Gaming professor and economist Edward Castronova demonstrated in 2002

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.640
that the MMORPG Everquest was the 77th richest country on the planet, with a GDP higher than that of China's.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.520
But say you don't want to spend all your time selling spiderling silk in the Bazaar.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.620
There's a world out there for every type of player.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:27.080
Sci-fi fans have Star Wars: The Old Republic.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.520
Fantasy players have got Lord of the Rings Online.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.820
There's even a DC Universe Online for comic book and superhero fans.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.040
And the future is showing a new generation of MMORPGs.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:41.500
Games like Guild Wars 2, Final Fantasy Online, and many others are keeping the genre alive and well.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.240
A new MMORPG, No Man's Sky, comes out in 2016,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.100
and according to its developer, Hello Games, offers players a chance to explore over 18 quintillion lifesize planets.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.000
Each planet will have its own unique environment.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.820
Sean Murray, the creator, states that,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:01.020
"Even if you explore each planet once a second, our own sun will burn out before you can see them all.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:03.700
This is all done with the power of procedural generation."

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.580
And rather than ending with that existential crisis, I'll leave with this -- humans have a few core drives.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.260
We want to be together and we want to explore new worlds, and with MMORPGs, we get the best of both.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.820
Thanks for watching. See you next time!

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.880
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.760
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.620
