00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Hi! I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:10.200
Now, when you think of Larping, maybe you conjure up an image of a group of nerds wearing homemade costumes, sporting foam weapons, and casting spells on each other in the park.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.560
And yes, larping is something that many self-proclaimed nerds do love, but it is also enjoyed by lots of other people all over the world!

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.360
The 2014 Larp Census (yes, that is a real thing)
documented participation in over 80 countries!

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.100
But larping is more than just a game – it’s a game
that merges performance, community, and art.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.060
It allows you to immerse yourself in the game
by literally taking on the role of your character.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.560
So let’s take a look at what larping is, where it
came from, and the impact it has on its players.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:44.740
[Theme Music]

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.100
LARP stands for live action role-playing game
(apparently the ‘g’ is silent).

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.340
And according to interactive game researchers
Falk and Davenport, it can be defined as

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.730
“a dramatic and narrative game form that
takes place in a physical environment.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.960
It is a storytelling system in which players assume character roles that they portray in person, through action and interaction.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:09.520
The game world is an agreed upon environment located in both space and time, and governed by a set of rules – some of which must be formal and quantifiable.”

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.880
So larping is similar to RPGs in that the players take on a character and pursue goals within a fictional setting.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.480
The difference is that players are physically acting out their character’s actions and interacting with others that are in character.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.260
Also like RPGs, larps are run by gamemasters
or GMs.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.300
GMs are responsible for creating the world
and controlling the narrative.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.480
They address its people and culture, technology
and weaponry, and its setting and time period.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.740
Then they draft the rules.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:40.340
This may involve creating a completely new set or modifying an existing system to address how the game will handle combat, magic, death, and character skills.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.700
GMs are responsible for acting as the referee
at the actual game.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.360
They must also perform the role of event planner – arranging for a venue, advertising for the event, and handling the finances.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.640
To help the GMs, there are NPCs or non-playable characters which are kind of like NPCs in video games, except they’re real people.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.190
Non-playable characters take on the role of
the characters that are part of the narrative.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.210
It is their job to help players along in the
game by dropping hints and clues.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.100
The players, who are known as PCs or player characters, may create their character or be given one by the gamemaster.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.920
And they don’t just describe their character
verbally like an RPG.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.200
They embody it, improvising speech and movements and creating costumes with specific equipment and weapons.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.540
And like in RPGs, a player’s character can
also change and develop as the game progresses.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.560
And there are countless genres that can influence
game worlds that these players participate in:

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.180
Victorian, Fantasy, Horror, Dystopian Social Commentary – pretty much anything you can think of.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.500
As well as three main styles of play.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.040
Demonstrative, or the battle game, is your standard boffer larp (boffer being the foam weapons players use to beat each other).

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.980
In this style, two groups go head to head on the battlefield, rushing at each other and attacking until one group is left standing.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.400
Salon is a theatre type larp which is focused
on player interactions rather than combat.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.700
In this style, the GM generally plans out the characters in advance and gives each player a character card.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.120
The players then use this information to determine
how they will respond to the narrative.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.680
And then there’s live steel where players aim for historical accuracy, using actual weapons and armor during play.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.920
Now the name is slightly misleading since players don’t generally use steel weaponry, but instead rattan weapons that might leave a bruise, but won’t maim other players.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.820
But of course, there are no hard and fast rules, so larp designers may use a mix of these styles in their games.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.769
Whatever combination the GM decides is needed
to achieve the goals of the narrative.

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.959
What this means is that each larp is unique
in its mix of genre and style.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.939
And the goals of each larp may differ too.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.799
Maybe you are tasked with finding the treasure and killing off foes, or maybe your objective is to solve clues to progress in the game.

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.539
Either way, no game is complete without a
set of rules.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.360
Rules should cover the type of combat, magic, and skills that can be used in the game, as well as how the game will determine and treat deaths of characters.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.120
These rules ensure that there is a framework for decision making during the game by GMs, PCs and NPCs.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.120
So how did all this LARPing get started?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.519
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.650
Role playing has been a form of entertainment
for centuries.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.160
For example, in 16th century England, Queen Elizabeth I organized lavish events for historical role-play.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:05.340
And role playing in the form of historical re-enactment became widespread in the 19th century, with a particular interest in recreating the Middle ages.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.640
Moving into the 20th century, role playing in the form of improvisation theater and “theater games” was developed as a way to train actors.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.800
But while these forms of role play all provided some entertainment value, they weren’t actually games.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.560
So really it could be argued that the first modern larp began in 1977 with Brian Wiese’s Dagorhir.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.110
Dagorhir was a live-combat group based in
the D.C. area.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.560
It focused on costumed, battle-like play involving padded weapons and it helped define how we think of the game today.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:40.120
Now Wiese claims that his game was not influenced by DnD, but was a way to experience the adventure of fantasy stories like J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings firsthand.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.260
A similar game was created by Peter Carey and Rob Donaldson in 1982 in Cheshire, England called Treasure Trap.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.720
This larp was also a live-combat group, but it did use an RPG for inspiration, using the location-based system of hit points and armor from Runequest.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.860
And while Treasure Trap only ran for 2 years, it did spawn many successors, including Durham University Treasure Trap and Labyrinthe.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:08.259
And starting in the 1980s, Larping can be found just about anywhere including Russia, which happens to have one of the biggest and most varied Larp scenes in the world.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.960
It’s during this time period that the most commercially successful larp, Mind’s Eye Theatre, was published.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.920
This game shared the theme and setting with
the RPG Vampire: The Masquerade.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.060
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:27.040
Now the types of larping we’ve talked about so far could be considered the more traditional approach, but there’s also a type of larping that has differentiated itself from all others: Nordic Larping.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:36.460
Now Nordic Larping was actually established in the 1980s with one of the first Larp events being created in 1985 by Swedish Larp group Gyllene Hjorten and it’s a campaign that continues even today.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:46.820
But Nordic Larp as a concept and approach was established by the annual Knutepunkt conference which was held in Oslo, Norway in 1997 and now rotates between Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:56.700
Nordic Larp is a variation of what we typically think of as larping, but it tends to focus on real-life situations rather than fantasy, and limits combat and magic, focusing more on immersive environments.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.600
As Lizzie Stark, writer of Leaving Mundania,
puts it, the focus is on:

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:07.120
“trying out a certain mindset or exploring an emotion, rather than saving a town from orcs or finding enough loot to buy a sweet magic item."

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:16.300
What this means is that unlike traditional larp where players are encouraged to make their mark on the created world, Nordic larp encourages players to focus on developing the character through the game’s narrative.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.400
It encourages the players to experience the life and face the challenges of someone else’s life that exists in the real world.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.200
Europa, for example, is a larp that explores
the experiences of refugees.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:32.740
Players take on the lives of people escaping their own war-torn countries, and play out the real-life tensions that exist between ethnic groups and between government representatives.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:39.200
Now the idea of playing a refugee victim as a game may sound controversial, but its goal is to help players better understand the challenges of others.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:46.980
Larping, in all of its forms, has exploded in recent years as its communities continue to grow and its uses outside of gaming are being discovered.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:57.260
Larping is being used in different sorts of educational contexts as a tool for teaching languages, conflict resolution, team building, therapy or even a way to test theories in fields like economics and law.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.080
Larp is especially interesting from a psychological
standpoint.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.560
As Lizzie Stark writes, “The yearning to experience personal emotion is one of the hallmarks of the larp movement today.

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:13.099
Many larpers want to experience emotions – the loss of a friend, the thrill of battle, the pain of betrayal – that they would never have occasion to feel in everyday life.”

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.990
Unlike many other games, larping places demands
on both the body and mind.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:23.650
As Dr. Bowman, a researcher of role-playing communities, points out, players often end a game feeling exhausted and emotionally raw.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.010
A player’s larp character becomes an extension
of themselves as well as a form of escape.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:34.180
And some players even play the same character for years, so ending a game or losing the character entirely can be difficult.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:44.280
Add this to the intense emotional and physical content of the narrative, and players are likely to experience emotional highs during the game, but also lows that can manifest themselves in what’s known as post-larp depression.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.480
But don’t worry, many larps hold group debriefing events to help provide a sense closure and sort through feelings.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.860
And players may also perform an individual de-roling process to readjust to regular self after being in character.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:08:02.960
So larping is unique in that it allows its players to explore certain aspects of their self and their emotions that they wouldn’t necessarily have a chance to do in regular life.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.980
And to do so in a safe environment, supported
by a community.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:11.460
They allow the player to fully immerse themselves in their character, the story, and the game in a way that other games cannot.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:19.100
As David Ewalt, author of Of Dice and Men puts it, "LARPs are allowing this unique way to express yourself or put yourself in someone else's shoes.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:23.520
It's illuminating. I think we'd live in a much more interesting world if everyone tried a LARP."

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.160
