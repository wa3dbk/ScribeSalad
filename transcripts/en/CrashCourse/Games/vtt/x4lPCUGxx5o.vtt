00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash
Course Games.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:09.060
Now that we’ve gotten this far along in the series, today we’re going to do something a little different and use everything we’ve learned to do a case study of sorts.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.700
We’re going to take a detailed look at a
single game that is actually a bit of a phenomenon.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.000
It has crossed cultural borders, geographical borders, genres, and even found itself in a bunch of different types of games and even non-gaming spheres.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.740
There’s probably only one game you can think
of that has done all this:

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.029
we’re talking about Pokémon which you probably
already figured out from the title.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.769
Pokémon has done something that very few
other games have done.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:38.749
We’ve talked about the cultural impact of games like Pac-Man and Mario, and those games were and still are hugely influential to gaming and pop culture, but Pokémon has managed to do something a little different.

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:45.789
So let’s dive into the history of Pokémon and try to figure out how it became the book, magazine, television show, movie, video game,

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:52.969
card game, mobile game, dice game, board game, educational game, pc game, role-playing game, and toy line that it is today.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.280
Did I miss anything?

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:03.360
[Theme Music]

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.480
So, 2016 marks the 20th anniversary of Pokémon.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.040
The first initial games were released on February
27th, 1996.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.940
It was then that the very first Pokémon games, Pokémon Red and the Japan-only Pokémon Green were set loose on the world.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.360
In September of 1998, Pokémon would make it’s way to the United States with Pokémon Red and Blue.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.300
So where did this idea of Pokémon come from?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:29.780
Well it all started with game maker Satoshi Tajiri’s desire to recreate his childhood experiences catching bugs and exploring around his home in Tokyo.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.940
He gained help from his artist friend Ken Sugimori who has been the official Pokémon artist this entire time.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.040
The friends formed a company called Game Freak
and later on a studio by the name of Creatures Inc.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.620
Tajiri was greatly inspired by the Game Boy
Link cable.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.780
He imagined that the cable allowed bugs and small creatures to travel from one system to another.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.400
And his second bit of inspiration came from
the TV show Ultraman.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.740
In this series large creatures were kept in
small balls ready for battle.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.940
This is why one of the original names for Pokémon was Capsule Monsters but was later changed to Pocket Monsters which in turn was shortened to Pokémon.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:11.500
But Tajiri and Sugimori had a terrible time pitching the idea to Nintendo until they made a friend in legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto who was able to successfully lobby the company to make the game.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.099
And the rest is now 20 years of history.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.860
Pokémon was designed to be a simple turn-based, role playing game with a storyline that could be played continuously.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.980
And while the style of game play doesn’t really change, the constant addition of new Pokémon manages to keep the game fresh and exciting.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.760
And the game was able to turn what is usually a solitary experience – playing on a handheld console, into a social activity.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.800
The game encouraged socialization by allowing Game Boys to be linked for multiplayer interactions within the game.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.860
Because the games were separated into colors, players that wanted to catch all the Pokémon had to trade with other players making the social interaction a necessary game component.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.760
And they have maintained that aspect since,
utilizing wireless adapters and online connectivity.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.280
And the game’s numerous monsters with their varying attributes is particularly well suited to the style of socializing that kids partake in – showing off what they know to other kids.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.700
I know some adults like that too.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.780
This is something the Pokémon franchise took advantage of in designing their games – understanding what kids enjoy.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.160
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.020
One of the main reasons the Pokémon franchise is so successful is that it based their products on the play strategies and social life of children.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.739
It is almost a reciprocal process.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.660
The creators used the culture produced by children as inspiration for their storylines and game design.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.560
This makes a product that children will take an active interest in and then manipulate for their own uses, providing even more fodder for producers to work with.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.280
As psychology researchers Laven, Gelman, and
Galotti put it,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:33.400
“Pokémon is an excellent example of the type of learning and memory competencies that thrive in a cultural setting that feeds children's interest through a variety of media.”

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.800
In a study focusing on Pokémon’s effects on children, they found that kids are incredibly knowledgeable about Pokémon.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.120
They are able to organize information about all the different characters in ways that are meaningful, like understanding how different characters might be linked.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.300
The study also found that it wasn’t the
parents teaching the children about Pokémon.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.440
Parents often had no idea what the game was
about or how it worked.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.700
What happened is that children learned from
other children as they socialized.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.560
So Pokémon manages to tap into kids minds by focusing their games on activities that are appealing to kids already:

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.660
identification (of monsters), memorization (of monsters and moves), collection and trading (of Game Boy monsters and cards).

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:15.500
And just like Tajiri’s original inspiration for the game, it taps into kids desire to explore the world by learning about creatures and how they evolve from one form to another.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.480
Of course, it helps that all of the Pokémon are super cool or super cute or like Pikachu – a nice mix of both.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.620
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:31.700
So, one year after the game was released the Pokémon television series was produced, bringing Pokémon to life through the story of Ash Ketchum and his quest to be the very best, like no one ever was, by catching them all.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.540
The Pokémon TV series first aired in Japan in 1997, turning the plot of the Game Boy games into an original series.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:44.360
But the series immediately diverged from the games by starting Ash out with Pikachu – a character not available to a new trainer in the games.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.940
This along with some slight changes helped the
series find its own voice apart from the game.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.680
And the first season was well received.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.820
So much that things would come full circle, with the series altering and inspiring future games.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.680
For example: Pokémon Yellow was a special edition of the Red and Blue games which featured Pikachu as a trainer’s first Pokémon.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.180
And just like in the animated series, little pikachu in the video game would follow you around while you were walking.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.650
So, after the first season a sort of formula
emerged connecting the games and the tv series.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:16.400
As new games were released, the series would advance the storyline to match so that Ash went to the same locations that the newly released games existed in.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.840
Ah cross marketing.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.720
This formula seems to be working out for the Pokémon series, because it’s currently in its 19th season and still going, having produced over 1000 episodes.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.360
It’s like an animated soap opera.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.400
It’s been licensed in 160 countries and
in 30 languages.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:37.300
And it’s important to note that the Pokémon names are translated across languages in a way that ensures they reflect that specific language and cultural appropriately.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.580
There have even been 19 different movies, the first one being in 1998 and aptly titled Pokémon: the First Movie.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.590
That’s pretty bold.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.930
Now, there is even talk of a live-action Detective
Pikachu movie in the works.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.170
But the series has come under some criticism.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.460
Producers of Pokémon were accused of creating a series that effectively functions as a weekly, 20 minute long commercial.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.700
But instead of denying this, the folks at the Pokémon Company openly acknowledged it, saying,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.480
"We consciously launched the TV show for the
intention of selling our products."

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.700
Now another arm in Pokémon’s franchise
is their Pokémon Trading Card Game.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.140
The game first debuted in 1996 in Japan.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.580
And while there were other versions previous
to this, it was the first to be branded Pokémon.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:23.320
The trading card game was inspired by the Red, Green, and Blue video games with the actual gameplay being based on the same mechanics as Magic: the Gathering, but simplified.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:29.700
Yet again, Pokémon had a success on their hands, having sold over 20 Billion cards over the last 20 years.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.400
The trading card game was received so well,
that they created digital versions of the game:

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.020
the Pokémon Trading Card Game on the Game Boy Color (and now for the 3DS) and Pokémon TCG Online for the computer.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:45.800
And while the rules for game play was simple enough for older kids and adults to master, younger kids found them complicated and often played by their own rules.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:47.280
But that’s the thing about the card game.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.140
It could be played by the rules, played by house
rules, or even just collected for the pretty pictures.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.520
So, the video games, television series, movies and
card games are all closely linked. Coincidence?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.180
No. This was a calculated approach
by its creators.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.080
J.C. Smith, marketing director for the Pokémon
Company International points out that"

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.770
“One of the reasons is the richness of its
world.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.700
There are more than 640 Pokémon now, so everyone
has a favorite or a team of favorites.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.660
The principle tenet of ‘Pokémon’ is collect,
trade and battle: Now you have 640 options.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:20.180
You can collect them, trade them with your friends, or train them for battle in the trading card or video games.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.560
People want to complete their collections or find that one new Pokémon that helps their battle strategy.”

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.120
And I’m assuming there’s more than 640
now, or there will be by the time this airs.

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.600
So unlike traditional venues, there really
is no end to the Pokémon experience.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:36.840
You can watch the TV show and when it ends you can continue in the world by picking up the video game or trading cards with your friends.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:42.720
And unlike Nintendo’s other first party titles, Pokémon are part of a privately held company, the Pokémon Company.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.500
Which gives them the flexibility to explore
other venues for connecting players to Pokémon.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:52.660
For example, in 2003, Play! Pokémon was established as a division of the Pokémon Company that hosted official leagues.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:58.740
Players could compete against each other in both trading card and video game formats in local, prerelease, or premiere tournaments.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.660
And if players were good enough they could
even compete in the world championships.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.220
It’s like trying to become a Pokémon Master
in real life.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.720
And speaking of which:

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:12.360
We now have PokémonGo, the AR mobile app addition to the franchise, which has so far proven a successful one.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:23.340
The game peaked at close to 45 million Daily Active Users around the middle of July 2016 and during the Sunday of its first release it accounted for around 47% of the US games market.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:25.040
Good luck getting your servers to work on
that day.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:27.450
And it’s being played in over 65 countries.

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:33.760
And in true Pokémon fashion, the game encourages social interaction between players – this time adding real world exploration.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:43.240
It also capitalizes on the nostalgia of the franchises oldest players, who are excited to once more immerse themselves into the Pokémon world or rather bring the Pokémon to our world.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.080
But it also introduces Pokémon to 2nd generation players who were too young to be there at the beginning.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.400
And just like the television show and card game, PokémonGo has found ways to even intersect with non-players lives.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.959
Local animal shelters have seen their adoption rates go up as they allow people to walk dogs and cats while they play.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:04.440
Shops of all kinds have seen an increase in business as they lure nearby PokeStops and attract not just Pokémon but new customers.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:10.780
And PokémonGo has also had a huge effect on peoples’ mental health by providing motivation to go outside and interact with people.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.620
There are probably people who never played Pokémon before who are now playing Pokémon Go.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:22.420
So Pokémon transcendence into a global phenomenon really comes down to carefully orchestrated planning.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:30.480
Pokémon managed to infiltrate itself into numerous the markets, merging them seamlessly into what the Centre on Japanese Economy and Business describe as a

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:38.960
“comprehensive entertainment package, which includes the elements of illustration, game program, sound effects, digital visual effects, and card trading.”

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:47.920
It’s not just that the Pokémon franchise was hugely successful, but that each arm of the franchise was an incredibly well implemented, orchestrated and successful piece of the Pokémon world.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.300
The creators of the game understood their target audience, and apparently still do by the looks of parents and children out there chasing Weedles and Pidgeys at your local park.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.380
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time!

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.240
By the way, is it weird that the first Pokémon
game I ever played was Pokémon Pinball?

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.260
Pokémon are everywhere, you can’t escape
them.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:11.840
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
