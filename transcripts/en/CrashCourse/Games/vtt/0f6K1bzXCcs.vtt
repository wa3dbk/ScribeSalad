00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Hi I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course
Games.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.920
Today, we’re going to talk about a genre of games that has really boomed in the past couple decades: open world games.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:17.240
I’m talking about the ones in which you can spend hours discovering every dark alley of a city, exploring a magical fantasy world, completing aimless quests, or even just choosing what you want your character to wear.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.300
We’re going to learn how these games are time capsules in that they reflect the capabilities of their hardware.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.480
And while they aren’t necessarily story-driven, we'll learn why they encourage us to redefine what narrative means and how they appeal to the social being and the explorer in all of us.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.380
Unless you don’t know how to control it
and you just keep running into walls constantly.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:42.580
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.000
Open World Games are video games that take
place in large, explorable worlds.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.590
The player chooses to partake in tons of optional
activities, rather than one clear, set path.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.130
Some of those pursuits relate to an overarching
goal or story and others don’t.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.710
And many can be completed in a nonlinear way.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.200
These games don't have a required genre – we’re going to be talking about RPGs, action adventure, fantasy, and more.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.080
We also have “sandbox games” whose definition
continues to be debated in the gamer community.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:14.640
Some view “sandbox games” as actually falling under the category of “open world games” and some see them as two interchangeable terms.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.620
Author Carolyn Handler Miller explains her perceived difference between a “sandbox game” and an “open-world game” in the book Digital Storytelling.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:32.560
She writes, “When distinctions are made between open world and sandbox games, sandbox games are regarded as a ‘toy box’ that contains tools that players can use to modify the game world and gameplay.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.200
Instead of containing set story elements like an open world game, players can construct a narrative while playing, creating an emergent story.”

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.400
This brings us to another important term in this genre: an “emergent story” is when a narrative becomes clear to the player, but it wasn’t written or planned that way.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.340
You can view it as a sort of improvisation that occurs between the player and the sandbox world they’ve been given.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.980
The people who created the game didn’t plan
a story, but the individual interprets one.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.540
This can also happen in multi-player games (think the MMORPGs we’ve discussed – people get together and make an emergent story).

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.980
And, as Miller notes, “Despite all the recent attention, the concept of emergence is still quite ambiguous and undefined in games.”

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.120
So, in this video, when I refer to a “sandbox game,” I’m talking about one with a lack of story and no clear end goal.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.120
You can have an “open world game” that’s not “sandbox,” but all “sandbox games” take place in an open world.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.560
Now, I’ve been talking primarily in video game terms so far, but this genre has origins outside of those.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.200
As you know from watching this series, gaming devices and consoles haven’t always had the capability to handle games like Fallout 4.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.939
But, people have always enjoyed emergent gameplay.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.439
It really started, in this context, with the
interactive fiction boom of the 1980s.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.580
There was the text-based computer game, Zork, created by MIT students, which was popular throughout the decade.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.040
In the game, you’d type in commands for your character to uncover a story piece by piece.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.760
Another text-based, interactive fiction game was the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy game, released in 1984 for computers and Atari.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.740
And, even before that, board games like Cosmic Encounter and RPGs like Dungeons and Dragons gave people the opportunity to create emergent narratives.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.620
These games all have one thing in common: they give people an amount of control over the stories and the gaming experience.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.440
In the 1990s, popular graphic adventure PC and video games came out, like Myst, another predecessor to open-world games.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:23.459
Another forerunner was the Ultima series, which ran from 1980 to 1999, and often gets credit for being the first RPG set in an open world while incorporating a vivid narrative.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.300
Then, some 3D open world games started popping up, like Super Mario 64, Body Harvest, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.060
Or is it Ocarina of Time?
[pronunciation: "oh" vs "ah"]

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.880
It’s always been a big debate.
You probably know.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.680
Now, Super Mario 64 might not be what you think of when you think open world game, but as scholar Henry Jenkins notes,

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.900
“I’ve always felt Mario 64 is the greatest sandbox game ever made because of its ingenious non-linear level design.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.820
Levels in Mario 64 do not rely on multiple paths but instead allow for improvisational play based on a simple, elegant rule set.”

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:59.639
Now it’s a little confusing, but worth pointing out that his definition of “sandbox game” differs from Carolyn Miller’s; as I said, these terms are still being shaped.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.000
Anyway, in a response to Jenkins,
his colleague Chris Kohler adds,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:12.020
“[Mario 64] also has emergent gameplay in the sense that a player can come up with ways to get around its challenges that even the developers never thought of, but which are not bugs.”

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.060
In 1999, two open-world games were released that allowed players to drive wherever they wanted to go: Driver and Crazy Taxi.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.200
And the same year, Shenmue was released for
the Sega Dreamcast.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.860
Shenmue’s open world is often compared to the one in Grand Theft Auto III, but it came first.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.580
There was a lot of hype – at the time, people believed it cost about $70 million to develop though it’s now thought to be closer to $47 million.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.710
It’s still a lot.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.800
The game was set in modern Japan and was an open, explorable world featuring a harbor, bars, shopping areas, and villages.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.200
There were details that were monumental for games at the time, like weather changes, communication with a bunch of characters, and the ability to closely observe and interact with objects.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.780
The graphics were pretty spectacular, too.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.540
Already, you can see how gaming devices needed to significantly progress in order for these games to develop.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.300
Zork was originally written for the massive PDP-10 - a computer that was typically used in universities.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800
Not really something the average American
could access.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.840
And even the later installments of Zork that did run on home computers were simple and based on text commands.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:14.120
The open-world style seen in Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Shenmue required more complex gaming devices to achieve that truly immersive feel.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.949
And a great example of this was 2001’s Grand
Theft Auto III, an important release for Sony.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:24.760
The game exemplified the special features of the Playstation 2: better graphics and bigger storage.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.540
There was a plot, but players were given tons
of freedom.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.460
They could explore the 3D world, which was
an entire city with three districts.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.140
They also had the option of following the main plot, or veering off into side missions and adventures.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.900
While some earlier games gave players control of the order of the missions, this game combined that freedom with the alternative of just exploring.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.000
Rockstar, the company that released Grand Theft Auto III, or GTA III, even gets credit for inventing the term “sandbox game.”

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.570
Now, I’m going to jump forward to more modern
games.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.090
I want to talk about these in terms of impact
on players.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.350
We’re going to look at them from two different
perspectives:

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.550
how they operate as social constructs and
as venues for exploration.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.780
Two good examples of open-world games that involve social dynamics are EVE Online and World of Warcraft.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.520
In these games, players form their own communites
that include economies.

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.440
They’re great examples of emergent narratives.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.700
But, we already talked about them, so if these MMORPGs are of interest to you, check out the episode on that.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.640
And there’s a newer open world game that incorporates socialization: Minecraft, which was released in 2011.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.080
Now, it’s one of the best-selling PC games
of all time.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.439
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.660
Minecraft was created by Swedish video game
designer Markus Persson aka Notch.

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:35.540
He cited other sandbox games as influences, including Dungeon Keeper, Infiniminer, and Dwarf Fortress.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.780
And, surprise surprise, he loved Lego growing
up.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:47.240
In 2009, Persson posted an unfinished version of Minecraft to gaming portal TIGSource, while working as a programmer at on online-photo sharing service called jAlbum.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.860
Minecraft was officially released in 2011.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.700
By 2012, it had sold 5.3 million copies, making
it the 6th best-selling PC game ever.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.640
It currently sits at number one with 24 million
copies sold.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:06.520
And thanks to additional console and mobile versions, it’s also one of the best-selling games of all time right up there with Wii Sports and Tetris.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.180
Minecraft is the epitome of a sandbox game.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.700
Players can choose to do basically whatever
they want.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.960
Though, there are different modes.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.320
If you’ve never played it, the world is made up of lego-like blocks – everything is constructible and de-constructible.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:20.320
You can play solo or multi-player.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.490
In the latter, you get to work with others
to create a structure from scratch.

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.530
Calling it a “game” doesn’t fully describe
the cooperative experience.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.479
You are literally building a world together
with your friends.

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:33.310
That’s more than just gameplay, that’s
a complete and unique social relationship.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:37.090
As journalist Clive Thompson puts it, “It
doesn’t really feel like a game.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.710
It’s more like a destination, a technical
tool, a cultural scene, or all three put together.”

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.610
In other words, games like Minecraft and MMORPGs
are redefining what “play” means.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:48.950
But, perhaps that’s not as new as it seems.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:55.220
As Thompson notes, the game echoes the early days of personal computers in which young people collaborated and learned to code together.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.340
Maybe playing Minecraft is similar to those
MIT students creating the first iteration of Zork.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:00.480
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.740
Kurt Squire of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has studied open-world video games to determine how people learn by playing them.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:15.420
In research published in 2008, Squire makes an interesting observation about how young people play Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas varies depending on the context.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:22.159
For example, when one 12-year-old participant described gameplay to the researchers, he said he spent much of his time designing and driving cars.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.900
But, when his friends were in the room, he spent more time talking about the violence he could enact.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:33.620
Squire writes, “Game play itself was a performance, one that arose in context, shaped – in part – by the other participants in the gaming experience

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.340
(such as those who might be huddled around the television watching).

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:40.820
These experiences suggest that, for players,
there is no one game that is played.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:45.100
Different game-play models and experiences
are activated by play in different contexts.”

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:52.080
So the people around us can affect HOW we play open world games – whether that’s cooperation in Minecraft or showing off to our friends in GTA.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:57.420
And while you might get similar results to Squire’s research with all types of games, there's more freedom in open world games.

00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:00.320
The format allows people to really show their
different facets.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.250
Moving on from games that emphasize socialization
to ones that pique curiosity and require exploration.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:11.360
There’s the The Elder Scrolls series, an open-world, fantasy RPG, created in the mid-90s by Bethesda Game Studios.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.620
Skyrim, the fifth installment in the series
was released to rave reviews in 2011.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:21.740
There is a plotline, but the game features an extremely open world, so you don’t have to follow the narrative if you don’t want to, and there’s plenty to explore.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.240
Then, there’s the Fallout series, which has been released by multiple studios since the late-90s.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.100
Fallout 4 came out in 2015 from Bethesda.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.940
It takes place in a post-apocalyptic version
of Boston.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:38.020
And not only can you explore and do quests, like Skyrim, you can create your own structures and houses, sort of like Minecraft.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.620
And, of course, your character is completely
modifiable.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:45.160
Something that sets Skyrim and Fallout apart from many other console games are modifications or mods.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.300
In 2016, mods were released by Bethesda for
Fallout 4 on Xbox.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:57.080
Like the PC mods we’ve discussed in this series, players can now on a console install user-created mods onto their games – weapons, quests, even cheats.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:02.080
You can imagine how mods would be especially appealing to players who choose games that center around exploration.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.860
These are people who prefer to create their own gaming experience – without having to strictly adhere to a storyline.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.960
A more recent example of a sandbox game is
No Man’s Sky.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.420
Every player starts the game with a broken
spaceship on a planet, chosen at random.

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:17.010
From there, you can wander and hunt resources,
travelling from planet to planet.

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:22.500
The game has no narrative, but there is a “goal” for interested players: reach the center of the universe where a mystery may be revealed.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.079
So the game is solely about exploration and
discovery of the planets and its inhabitants.

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:28.319
According to Jake Swearingen of New York Magazine,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:35.280
“Within the first night of the game’s release, players had already discovered over 10 million species of living things – more than we know about on our own planet.”

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.680
There’s no way to know where the open-world
genre is headed.

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.720
We’re talking about something that’s going to continue to experience huge innovation for years to come.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.300
And as future you is lining up for the latest
versions of Grand Theft Auto and Fallout

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.660
(or waiting for their Amazon package to arrive,
probably by drone)

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.120
take some time to reflect on everything open-world
games have taught us about ourselves.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.600
We can create our own narratives, through
emergent stories.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:01.240
We can learn about and develop our own interests and priorities – whether that be socializing in Minecraft, exploring a vacant planet in No Man’s Sky,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.220
following a pre-existing storyline in Shenmue, or just stealing a car in Grand Theft Auto III.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.440
It’s fun.
Don’t do it in real life though.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.380
Thanks for watching.
I’ll see you next week in this open world!

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:17.740
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana, and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
