00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.220
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows, this is Crash Course Games, and today, we’re totally talking about the 1980s.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.840
Like for sure. Gag me with a spoon. The 80s were kind of a big deal when it comes to video games.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.190
And hairspray. And breakdancing.
But this show is about games.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.690
In the 1980s video games really became a big
business,

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.720
as arcades and home systems became more of
a worldwide cultural thing.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.830
But it’s not all good news, high scores
and buckets of beautiful, shiny quarters.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.020
There’s some tragedy, too. In the 1980s, the video game industry had a Boom, but then it had a Bust.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:42.660
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.580
Let’s start with the Boom.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.600
In the early 1980’s Atari, Coleco, Mattel they were selling a lot of video games and consoles.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.960
It was kind of a golden age of gaming.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.280
By 1982 there were an estimated 24,000 arcades
and 1.5 million arcade cabinets in the US.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:08.000
A 1981 Time article reported 20 billion quarters were going into these machines to buy 75,000 hours of playtime.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.640
Video weren’t toys and hobbies anymore.
They were popular culture.

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.729
They were on TV, they were in magazines, and
in movies like War Games and Tron.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.640
While there were a lot of arcade and console
games being produced in the early 80’s,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.240
a few huge, influential hits dominated the arcades, and informed the game design of the day.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.400
Like this guy right here, Pac-Man waka waka
waka waka.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.179
Namco’s Pac-Man, who was called Puck-Man in his home country of Japan, was designed by Toru Iwatani.

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.990
And if you want to know why they changed it
from Puck-Man to Pac-Man when it came to America,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.050
uh, watch Scott Pilgrim Vs The World - has
a whole scene that explains it.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.940
Anyway, Pac-Man with his power pellets and
ghost monsters

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.649
went onto become the first video game character
with a TV show.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.359
I used to watch the Pac-Man cartoon.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:51.090
He even had toys, lunch boxes, all that merchandise
stuff.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.669
This expanded the ways games could earn revenue.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:58.259
Pac-Man also revolutionized game design with the addition of the world’s first video game cutscenes,

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.859
which were place to give players’ wrists a break and to advance the story, although it wasn’t a very deep story.

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.859
Although I did like that part where Pac-Man
goes off screen and he comes back really big!

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.840
A sequel to Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man was another
huge hit,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.060
and Ms. Pac-Man was the first female protagonist
in a game.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.480
The game built on a lot of what made it’s
predecessor so popular.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.600
The game improved the play from Pac-Man, and improved on the cut scenes of the original, including a love story.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.100
Act 1: they meet. Act 2: the chase. Act 3: Jr.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.940
Jr Pac-Man of course got his own game too.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.860
There were so many awesome arcade games of
the 80s,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.790
Q*bert, that’s my personal favorite, Frogger,
Burger Time, Joust.

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.950
But the biggest of the big 1980s games was the tale of barrel throwing, girl-friend kidnapping ape

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.780
by the name of Donkey Kong,
created by Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto,

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.440
who would later create Mario, Link, and Pikmin.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.090
Miyamoto chose the name Donkey to convey the
idea of stubbornness,

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.799
and added the Kong of course to evoke famous
giant ape movie star, King Kong...Donkey Kong!

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.939
The game was the classic tale of a carpenter/woman/gorilla love triangle.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.849
It was hard to play, but it was fun to play
and it was a massive hit.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:16.360
Nintendo sold 60,000 cabinets and made $180 million on Donkey Kong by the middle of 1982.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.780
Donkey Kong and other games of the early 1980’s
also saw the birth of competitive video gaming,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.320
which would have an enduring effect on the
industry. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.700
As video games became a fixture of pop culture,
elite players began to emerge,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.900
so it was only natural that they’d start
to compete.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.040
Contests and high-score competitions became
common,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.829
and they weren’t just for the stereotypical
teen boy video gamer.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.519
For example, Doris Self set the Q*Bert world
record in 1984

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.739
at the Twin Galaxies Video Game Masters Tournament
at the age of 58.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.040
But this kind of marathon play wasn’t what
game designers originally had in mind.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.489
Games like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong were intended
to give players a few minutes of play time,

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.819
and then make them pay another quarter to
play again.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.889
Elite players’ skills allowed them to play
games all the way to the end.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.139
It was something designers hadn’t planned
for.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.040
Many of the most popular games didn’t even
have endings.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.660
The programming would just eventually break,
in what players called a kill screen.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.700
Pac-man for example, famously broke on level 256, thanks to a limitation to the 8 bit memory space.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.160
In Donkey Kong, players could go as far as
level 117,

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.250
at which point the game randomly killed poor
Jumpman, aka Mario off,

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.030
leaving his quest to save Pauline tragically
incomplete.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.340
Players at home were also becoming more skilfull,

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.280
and wanted a stronger feeling of achievement
from their gameplay.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.680
So companies like Activision responded by
rewarding players with real world prizes.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.500
Players who mailed in a picture of a high score from an Activision game were mailed an embroidered patch.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.699
Players would then sew these onto their clothing
and show off their skills.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.970
Being good at video games had literally become
a badge of honor.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.490
These achievements weren’t just about making
players feel good though.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.830
They were also a powerful marketing tool.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.340
Competitive gaming and the bragging rights
that came with high scores

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.460
were an important part of creating a culture around gaming, and they also drove a lot of sales.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.160
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So it’s cool to
see all these competitive and elite gamers,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.960
but increasingly sophisticated players meant that games needed to become more sophisticated and interesting as well.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.740
That meant the 1980’s also saw huge leaps
in terms of game design.

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.220
Take for example Defender by Eugene Jarvis and Larry DeMar, is recognized as one of the first “hard-core” games.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.479
Many employees at Williams, the company behind
the game, thought it was too difficult,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.580
but the designers wrote the game so that even the most skilled player couldn’t break it by being too good.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.980
But Defender’s difficulty didn’t hurt
its sales. It may have even enhanced them.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.000
It sold over 55,000 cabinets, and according
to GameSpy magazine, the game earned over

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.380
a billion dollars by 2001.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.360
It seemed like gamers wanted challenging games.
And Defender was also technically innovative.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.430
It was one of the first scrolling shooter
games, and it introduced the idea of a minimap.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.660
Then of course there was Centipede.
You all remember Centipede.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.520
Centipede would come down, you would roll that trackball around and the ship would move. Pew. Pew.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.020
Centipede was created by Ed Logg and Dona
Bailey,

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.740
who was one of the few women among early video
game programmers.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.520
Dona Bailey said, "I really wanted it to look different, to be visually arresting." And visually arresting it was.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.310
Not only was Centipede a popular game, but
it had a significant female audience.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.220
Gaming in the 80s was becoming more of a universally
accepted form of entertainment for everyone.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.430
E for everyone.
Oh wait that's… that’s later.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:15.840
So, game designers were innovating to capture
different markets in the arcades,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.099
but they were also beginning to recognize
and design for the very different experience

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.330
of playing games on a home console.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.509
In the early days of console gaming, most of the titles available were ports of arcade hits

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.370
that attempted to recreate an arcade experience
at home.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.740
Activision’s Pitfall was not one of those
games.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.780
It was released on the Atari 2600, and was
designed as a longer, more complex experience.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.540
The game was written to last 20 minutes, which was much, much longer than other games of the time.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.699
Pitfall changed the pace of games.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:46.000
It established the home console market as a place for games people spent significant time with,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.900
and connected with in a way that was difficult
than with an arcade game.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.500
So this is where we get to the Bust,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.320
which some people call “The Great North
American Video Game Crash of 1983.”

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.139
But, we’re going to continue to call it
the Bust.

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:00.759
The early 1980s were a time of innovation
and growth in the video game industry,

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.800
but those years were also pretty unstable.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.840
Lots of emerging industries experience a sort of “wild west” situation in their early years.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.040
Think back to the thrilling early years of
the washing machine industry.

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.189
What is that, even? Video games were no different.

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:17.680
Video games were popular, and they were new,
and not everyone understood them very well.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.199
It seemed like a sector where easy profit could be had, and lots of companies wanted to get into the market.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:26.099
The problem is, small companies didn’t have
the resources to create quality games,

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:30.580
so they started cranking out terrible products,
and large brands tried to jump on the bandwagon

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.800
with some really terrible games that blurred
the line between games and marketing.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.140
Quaker Oats bought a video game division. Quaker Oats. You make oats, Quaker. Not video games.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.740
And brands that had no connection to video games commissioned terrible, terrible games just to promote their products.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.920
Aficionados of Purina’s Chuck Wagon brand could send in proofs of purchase to get this beauty, Catch the Chuck Wagon.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.940
I’m not sure who this game was for, as most of Chuck Wagon’s most loyal customers are dogs.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.580
And not only did consoles have to compete
against each other,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:04.680
they also had to compete against home computers
like the Apple II or Commodore 64 here.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.660
You see video game consoles had one function,
entertainment, but computers were multi-functional.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.200
So that was their selling point.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.500
We could be your word processor.
We could be your spreadsheets.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.389
And also we can play video games.
That further crowded the market.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:21.319
So all those consoles plus home computers
contributed to the sense that there were just

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:23.280
too many systems to choose from.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:29.040
For example, Frogger could be played on 8 different home systems, in addition to the arcade options.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.140
Atari, the industry’s biggest player wanted to retain market share in the face of all this competition,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.120
and their solution was to rush games through
development.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.800
That was not a good solution.

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.160
Games that should have taken 6 months to create
were instead created and released in 6 weeks.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.400
The home version of Pac-Man was so bad that the public returned the cartridges back to stores.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.940
Pac-Man - one of the most popular video game
characters of the 80s.

00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.780
In 1983, Atari lost nearly $500 million,
and was bleeding around $2 million a day.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.860
The company cut its workforce from 10,000
employees to 400.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:06.500
And this leads us to the quintessential bad
game of the Bust.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.560
A movie license of Spielberg’s E.T., the
Extraterrestrial.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.320
Atari paid $21 million for the rights, but only spent 5 weeks making the game, and it was terrible.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.300
It’s been accurately called one of the worst
games of all time,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.820
and many people even blame it specifically
for the video game bust.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.370
The public was starting to lose confidence
in the gaming industry.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.860
5 million copies of E.T. were manufactured,
but only 1 million sold.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.270
The rest of the cartridges wound up buried
in a landfill near Alamogordo, New Mexico.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:38.850
The Great Crash was sort of like the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event,

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:43.540
except there was no giant meteor hitting the
Earth - instead really bad games hitting consoles.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:48.230
The ColecoVision, Intellivision, Odyssey systems
all disappeared.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:53.200
While the video game industry was devastated by the crash, a few companies did survive the carnage.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.900
In the late 1980s, one of those survivors
from Japan, the Nintendo Corporation, would

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.920
rise to dominate the industry.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.800
Nintendo did this by correcting many of the
mistakes of the gaming industry’s past.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.840
Nintendo’s consistent focus on quality and player experience would take the company to the forefront of the industry.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.000
But we’ll talk about that next week.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.760
Oh yeah, Nintendo’s getting its own episode!

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:18.620
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:20.920
and it’s made with the help of all these
nice people.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.300
