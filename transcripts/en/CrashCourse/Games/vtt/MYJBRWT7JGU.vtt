Hi, I'm André Meadows.
This is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:10.720
In this episode, we're going to explore the psychology behind games and see what leading experts have to say about why we play them and what they teach us about ourselves and others.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:20.640
Now, this is an episode on psychology which, well, is one of these squishier sciences, but there are some legitimate studies in the field and some of those even happen to be about games.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.800
So sit back, relax, and let's talk about your Mother... Brain.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:33.960
[Theme Music]

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
Games are incredibly effective at satisfying many of our intellectual needs.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.520
You may have heard of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.010
You know, the enemy of John Green and Hazel Grace Lancaster?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.010
It's a common topic in Psych 101 classes and it ranks human needs, suggesting that lower priority needs must be met in order for us to reach self-fulfillment.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.620
Now, I should note that there are some criticisms of this model's over-simplification of the human psyche, but it's kind of useful for our purposes as it relates to games.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.580
The model suggests that you're not going to care about writing that term paper when you're hungry,

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.820
and if you don't have a roof over your head, trying to beat the Turbo Tunnel from Battletoads probably isn't the top priority.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.060
I don't know, some people, I think, it still is.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.660
But once you meet those basic needs and have a good social support system, you find yourself wanting more fulfillment, and this is where games come in.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.400
The beauty of a game system is just that -- it's a system.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.020
Games produce perceptible results so once a player completes a game, they are given feedback telling them how well they've done.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.720
This could be done at the end of a game level, on a phone, in a deck of cards, or even on the kitchen table.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.460
Modern video games have extensive achievement systems in which players can compare their achievements to others.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.640
These constructs allow players to see how far they've come and how far they need to go, basically outlining a direct path to fulfillment.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.000
But competition isn't the only social drive for playing games.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.980
Academic Jane McGonigal explains that,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.200
"co-operative gameplay is also psychologically driven, as it has been shown to lift players' moods longer than competitive play."

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.120
"It also helps build stronger relationships."

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.820
So we've talked about why we like games, but not all players play the same types of games.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.680
Why do some people prefer football and others poker?

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.600
Well, first, let's talk about the satisfaction we get from games.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.180
Roger Caillois classified games in his landmark book Man, Play, and Games based on the different experiences games create.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.120
Competition experiences are found in games like basketball and go.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.620
In these games, the enjoyment lies in overcoming the challenge of the opponent.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.400
Chance experiences are found in games like slot machines or dice rolls.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.660
In these games, the joy lies in the excitement of not knowing and trying to guess an unpredictable outcome.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.060
Vertigo experiences can be found in games that require intense concentration in which the user gets in the "zone".

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.300
We'll talk more about that in a bit.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.840
And make-believe experiences allow players to assume characteristics and abilities they don't possess in real life.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.460
For example, League of Legends allows players to act as an all-powerful summoner working for the greater good.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.120
Not something we get to do in real life.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.020
So games are composed of any combination of these gaming experiences and they define why we play games.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.620
But how do we decide which game
we would like to play?

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.000
Well, to better understand, we're going to have to look at the psychology of players.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.180
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.620
Richard Bartle, a founding father of the MMORPG gaming genre, spent much of his life trying to describe character identities of players.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.780
In 1996, he published a paper that would describe the Bartle Test.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.700
Now, the Bartle Test was based around
immersive world games,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.520
and Bartle himself states that is incomplete for different game types,

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.120
but is still useful for understanding gamer preferences.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:30.000
Bartle claims that all players can be described by their scores across four main character types -- achievers, explorers, socializers, and killers.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.420
Achievers find fulfillment in success.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.280
They're a completionist that finds satisfaction in gaining points, completing quests, or leveling up.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.740
Most MMORPGs, like World of Warcraft, are designed for this character type.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.280
Explorers find fulfillment in discovery.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.519
They often feel restricted by tightly controlled games and enjoy learning about hidden places, finding easter eggs, or revealing glitches within the game.

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.859
A game like Myst is designed for this character type.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.900
Socializers gain enjoyment through interaction with other players, or even AI.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.500
This character type tends to play games that rely heavily on relationships and communities within the game, like Animal Crossing.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.500
And lastly, killers enjoy competing with other players in the game.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.780
This character type seeks to dominate the game itself and other players through their actions in games like Call of Duty.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.420
A player's gaming preference is a combination of how strongly they identify with each of these character types,

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.900
and they find the most satisfaction in games that align with these preferences.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.060
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.480
Now we should talk about flow, or the "zone".

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.260
This is a theory on mental states defined by a Hungarian psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.680
People find themselves in the zone when the outside world slips away and they are fully engaged with the task at hand.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.240
Ever play a game and someone was talking to you or something's happening around and you don't even notice it?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240
You're in the zone.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.820
Csíkszentmihályi described it as "being completely involved in an activity for its own sake.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.880
The ego falls away.
Time flies.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.760
Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.480
Your whole being is involved, and you're using your skills to the utmost."

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:00.840
Baseball players, musicians, gamers, and many others have all reported this state of being.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.480
And Csíkszentmihályi claims that he knows the factors necessary to reach this state of mind.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.420
First, players must be engaged in something that can be actually done.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.560
It can't be a simple activity like sitting, but it also needs to be something that requires some skill.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.160
Players must also be fully engaged with no distractions in a task with clear goals and constant feedback.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.640
This is where games excel.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.320
And the players need to be able to have some control that requires significant concentration, almost like meditation.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.840
When the zone is finally achieved, players will become fully integrated into the activity

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.800
and will experience altered time, and what takes hours may feel like only minutes.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.300
And if you're playing Bayonetta, you're experiencing altered time and witch time.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.620
In a 2008 study by Lennart Nacke and Craig Lindley, it was found that first person shooter games fit Csíkszentmihályi's zone perfectly.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.360
Games like Doom and Call of Duty help players achieve the zone by allowing them to become fully immersed through the first-person mechanic,

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.860
while at the same time creating a mix of challenge and tension through shooting mechanics.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.620
So we've seen how games affect our brains while we're playing the games, but do these games affect our behavior in real life?

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:11.940
Video games, and especially violent video games, have often come under fire for their realistic, and sometimes unrealistic, portrayals of war, murder, and other terrible stuff.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.400
And media outlets have had a rich history of trying to tie violent video games to real-life violent behavior.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:23.940
For example, in 1999, much was made of the fact that the perpetrators of the Columbine high school mass shooting were avid Doom players.

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.039
But it isn't just the media that thought so.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:33.619
In 2015, the American Psychological Association released a report tying violence in video games to real life regression.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.640
The report found "a consistent relation between violent video game use and increases in aggressive behavior,

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:46.440
aggressive cognitions and aggressive affect, and decreases in pro-social behaviour, empathy and insensitivity to aggression."

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.320
But wait before you put your all caps rebuttle in the comments section.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.140
Just know that not everyone agrees.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.060
The APA's report and others like that have been met with criticism, and not just from the gaming industry.

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:04.110
Critics argued the APA studies were flawed and failed to take into account other factors that can lead to violent
behavior, including socio-economic status and violence in the home.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:10.760
Critics also point out that crime statistics don't show an increase in violent crime, despite the massive growth in the video game industry.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.900
In fact, violent crime has been steadily dropping for decades.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:22.420
And a 2011 study by Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University even found that playing violent video games led to a decrease in frustration and aggression.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:32.700
The debate over violent video games is far from settled, but evidence is mounting all the time that the vast majority of people who play video games have a strong ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:36.920
Most players don't engage in violent behavior after shooting up their friends in Call of Duty.

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.100
Just like I don't go around stomping on turtles after playing Super Mario Bros.

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:47.670
So whether it's through studies, discussions, debates, or personal experience, we learned that games are capable of stimulating amazing things in our brains.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.290
And we play games because they help us feel fulfilled.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.320
Games vary by experiences, but they all have a component of satisfaction.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.220
But all players are different, and our differences dictate the games we choose and the ones that get made.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.500
And if we choose the right one even time itself can seem to stand still.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.420
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.300
