00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
Hi, I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash
Course Games.

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:05.410
Today we’re going to take a brief look at
the world of PC Gaming.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.300
That’s right PC Master Race we’ve got you covered.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.780
Because computers did start the video game
age after all.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.280
They were the precursor of the console, hand-held systems, and all other technological gaming genres.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.320
But just because PC Games led to all the other types of video games doesn’t mean they’re antiquated.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.920
PC gamers prefer playing on computers because they provide a gaming landscape where players, designers, and developers intermingle.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:32.200
Players can alter and modify their systems and games to their tastes, and unlike on consoles, designers and developers craft games untethered to a single machine.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:41.060
And this world of PC Gaming is so diverse and imaginative that you might find games like Meatboy, 7th Guest, and RollerCoaster Tycoon all on the same computer.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.800
And Minesweeper don’t forget Minesweeper.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.180
PC Gaming continues to be a powerhouse and
the foundation for all modern video games.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.500
So let’s take a look at how they got their
start and where they are going in the future.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:59.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.140
So, pretty much as soon as computers appeared after World War II, people started making games to play on them.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.180
But you’ve seen those early computer pictures.
They were huge.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:15.560
It wasn’t until the microprocessor was developed in the 1960s and 70s, when computers morphed from room-sized behemoths to the desktop, and eventually to the handheld ones we know today.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:24.000
In 1974, MITS or the Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems Company introduced the Altair 8800, a build-it-yourself computer kit.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.980
It didn’t have a keyboard or screen, but it did give feedback through a row of lights that flashed back at people.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.730
This is considered the first commercially
successful PC.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.290
But home computers didn’t grab the public’s
gaming imagination at first.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.710
It was the advent of arcade machines that
did it.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.840
Games like Pong, Gun Fight, and Lunar Lander filled arcades all over the world due to their ease of play and availability.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.380
This in turn led to home consoles like the Odyssey, Atari, and ColecoVision, which we talked about earlier in the series.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.820
At the same time, PCs were evolving at an
amazing rate.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.820
Computer gaming continued to grow, and by the late 1970’s video games began to split into two different, though intrinsically linked lines.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.580
On one side you had the dedicated gaming consoles that eventually lead to Nintendo, Sega, Xbox, and Playstation.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.260
On the other side, we saw PC gaming nestle
deep into the world of computers.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.440
Interesting enough, the rise of PC Gaming began in the US just before the Great Video Game Crash of 1983.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.360
The Crash caused the public to lose faith
in home consoles.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.440
And PCs were there with open arms to quickly
welcome this new audience.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.610
How did PCs survive?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.099
Well, after the crash they were clever to advertise themselves as machines that could do more than simply play games.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.059
They sold the public on the PC's ability to
multi-task.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.160
Yes, you could play games, but you could also manage taxes, study geography, and do homework too.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.100
PC sales began to grow, and games came along
with them.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.140
The classic Commodore 64 is a great example
of the PC's success at this time.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.100
It came out in 1982 and was founded by computer
businessman Jack Tramiel.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.580
During its 12 year lifespan, over 17 million units were sold and a staggering 10,000 commercial programs were made.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.120
Technologically-speaking, the Commodore 64
was a huge step forward.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.840
It ran on a MOS 6510 microprocessor that gave
it 64 kilobytes of RAM. Wow.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.220
The display could create 16 colors, 40 columns,
and 25 lines of text with a 320 x 200 resolution.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.500
That might all sound quaint today but back
then that was cutting edge.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.100
What kept people coming back was the ever-increasing
games and program library.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.620
You could find a program on just about anything for the C64, there were 10 thousand of them remember?

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.480
But if you couldn’t, and had the skills,
you could probably program it yourself.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.740
And that sense of openness and opportunity for experimentation can still be found in many PC gamers today.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.100
In the United Kingdom, another early computer would also heavily influence the industry - the ZX Spectrum.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.580
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:47.720
Released by Sinclair Research Ltd in 1982, the ZX Spectrum, with its efficient design, was the brainchild of the company’s founder Sir Clive Sinclair.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.120
He was literally a genius -- the guy designed a compact submarine at the age of 14 -- and a lover for all things computer.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.240
One of Sinclair’s first creations was the
ZX80.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.620
It had a great price point but was underpowered,
even for the day.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.120
It barely had 900 bytes of RAM.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.100
In today’s terms that’s about six tweets.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.220
Thankfully Sinclair learned from his mistakes.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.080
The ZX Spectrum addressed a lot of the early issues, and would go on to become a British gaming institution.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.340
While it still had a few shortcomings and was received poorly everywhere else in the world,

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.040
the ZX Spectrum had more influence over gaming in the U.K. than the original NES.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.560
There were six magazines and well over 24,000
games devoted to the Spectrum.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.360
It was so successful that Sinclair was knighted
by Queen Elizabeth II.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.140
The system became a point of national pride and even won out against more technologically sound PCs like the Commodore 64.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.080
The Spectrum inspired generations of game creators such as Chris Davis, the one man team of Mouldy Toof Studios and developer of The Escapists.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.840
Davis cited the Spectrum as his inspiration,
saying that,

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.340
“My interest in making games started back
as a kid with the ZX Spectrum.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.640
While all of my friends were moving into the 16-bit era, the Spectrum was my first proper dose of video gaming.”

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.780
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:04.100
So, by the start of the 1990’s, PC Gaming was moving towards a golden age, ushering in a number of unique gaming experiences that could only be found on a PC.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.560
Let’s start with real-time strategy or RTS.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:15.960
This genre of PC game play focuses on securing locations and destroying your opponent’s assets through resource gathering, base building, technological development, and indirect control of units.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.740
Dune II: the Building of a Dynasty was one of the first games to establish RTS as we know it today.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:26.500
The game was released in 1992 and included key elements of RTS such as a world map to choose the next mission,

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.789
different factions, mobile and base unit construction, and funding through resource gathering.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:36.649
But what really made RTS and Dune II special was the use of the mouse and keyboard to move units within the game.

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:39.539
According to its co-designer and lead programmer,
Joe Bostic,

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.840
"This greatly facilitated precise player control, which enabled the player to give orders to individual units.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:49.639
The mouse, and the direct control it allowed,
was critical in making the RTS genre possible.”

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.119
This game has gone on to inspire other monumental
games such as Starcraft and Warcraft.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.800
First person shooters also flourished in the
PC space.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.960
Using 3D graphics, these games allowed players much greater freedom of movement, compared to many other games of the time.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.040
Wolfenstein 3D is the game that really made
this genre popular.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:13.800
Released in 1992 on MS-DOS, interestingly as shareware, Wolfenstein helped establish the basic mechanics of this genre and still heavily influences FPS games today.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.840
Not to mention serving as the template for Doom.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.260
And we can’t talk about PC games without
mentioning simulators.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:25.920
Simulators attempt to simulate real life activities like flight or surgery by allowing for freely controlled characters and environments.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:32.760
Now it can be argued that some simulators aren’t actually games as many are used for on-the-job training or education vs leisure play.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.920
But one of the most popular simulators, that
is definitely a game, is SimCity.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.960
Released in 1989 (okay, not quite the 90s, but close enough) SimCity simulated various aspects of city management.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.140
The game also features one of the defining aspects of simulation - that there is no clearly defined goal for the player to achieve.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.120
And game publishers weren’t too receptive to the idea, thinking that the game would sell poorly.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.600
But SimCity was a runaway success selling
an estimated 1 million copies by 1992.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.300
I even owned a copy of SimCity, but I owned it on Super Nintendo don’t judge me it had Bowser in it.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:07.100
Now, we know that puzzles aren’t technically considered games, but throw puzzle solving into a narrative and you’ve got yourself an adventure.

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:13.719
The adventure genre is typically designed for a single player who acts as the protagonist of the story, solving puzzles to progress through the game.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.780
Now, the initial adventure games were text-based, where the computer would translate the input into commands for the game.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.020
As PCs became more powerful, graphics were
added to create an illustrated narrative.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.620
Take Myst for example.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.400
Originally released in 1993, players walked around an oddly quiet and mysterious island attempting to solve various puzzles and riddles.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.480
This game was unusual for the time because it provided little character backstory, there was no physical violence, and no goals laid out for the player.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:40.320
I'm sensing a trend here with PC games.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:48.620
But Myst was a huge success and helped pave a new avenue in the puzzle gaming genre, inspiring games like 7th Guest, 11th Hour, and even its own sequel.

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.220
Also, we can thank Myst for helping drive
the adoption of the CD-ROM.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.600
You’re welcome Playstation and other future
gaming consoles.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:59.039
With the 90s, we also see the rise of LAN
parties or Local Area Network parties.

00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:02.899
These were gatherings where people could connect
their computers to play multi-player games.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:10.100
In 2013, Sweden saw the biggest LAN party to date with over 17,000 devices connected during the DreamHack festival.

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:13.400
Today, we see unprecedented access to PC games.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.080
Internet portal sites are popping up, like NewGrounds and Kongregate, delivering gaming to millions.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.100
Sites like Neopets have become commonplace,
allowing anyone to log in and play from anywhere.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.220
PC gaming has also led to the rise of gaming
platforms like Steam by Valve.

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.500
Steam is an online service that distributes games and other media created by developers to its shared subscriber base.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.139
Officially released in 2003, Valve has continued to thrive for years, and may be ushering in the next golden age of PC gaming.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:48.620
There are over 125 million active Steam users worldwide, and the system has over 4500 games and 400 million items created by users.

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.000
Valve even has its own VR unit but we’ll
get into that in the next episode.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.220
And PC Gaming really sets itself apart because both players and creators can take part in the creation process.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.500
Take mods, for example, where people alter a game mechanic to their own, often bizarre, liking.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:09.780
The practice of modding has led to all kinds of wonderfully bizarre, funny, and challenging new games like Macho Man Randy Savage in Skyrim.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.200
Or Marty McFly and his time-traveling Delorean on the streets of San Andreas in Grand Theft Auto.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.000
This could also lead to a problem like cheating
but I digress.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.980
Not going to get into that.
That’s your conscience.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.940
It’s clear that PC gaming is thriving, and continues to inform many games on a variety of platforms.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:29.220
Some game genres truly are best when played on a PC, and many great games can only be played on this platform.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:33.360
PC gaming has inspired originality in game
development like no other platform.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.250
It’s come a long way since Minesweeper.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.690
Which can someone really tell me the rules
of Minesweeper I still don’t get it.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.890
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you next
time!

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.720
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and
