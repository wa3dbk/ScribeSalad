00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hi, I'm Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.260
Today we're gonna talk about the second half of the 1980s,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.660
when the video game industry was reborn, largely due to the influence of Nintendo.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.360
Now, after the great North American video game crash in 1983, which was called "The Atari Shock" in Japan,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.540
the video game console industry in the United States was crushed!

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.600
"Odyssey", "Colecovision", "Intellivision" and others left the marketplace. "Atari" was sold off.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.060
The U.S. home console and cartridge market, which was worth nearly 3 billion dollars in 1982,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.340
fell to 100 million dollars in 1985, according to Nintendo of America.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.500
And those numbers aren't adjusted for inflation!

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.580
The number of console games produced also dropped dramatically.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.820
But at the same time,
the home computer market was growing,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.000
and video games for the Commodore 64 and Apple II looked like the future of gaming

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.380
So much, in fact, that "Video Games Player" magazine changed their name to "Computer Games" ... traitors!

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.220
But the video game crash that we talked about last time, happening in the United States, didn't happen in Japan.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.660
And Nintendo, which started as a playing card company, would bring video gaming back.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.060
How did they start? And what changed everything in the Mid-'80s?

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.940
Well, grab a hold of your plumber's hat, your Triforce, and don't get turned into an eggplant - cause we're gonna find out!

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.740
[Theme Music]

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.100
Nintendo was founded in 1889 (Now, that's old-school!) by a young Fusajiro Yamauchi,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.420
to distribute his handmade playing cards.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.420
For eight decades, Nintendo made cards and toys.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.620
And the company still produces a line of playing cards today, but mostly as a tribute to its past.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.220
Nintendo broke into the video game market in the 1970s,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.020
when they won the rights to distribute the original Magnavox Odyssey console in Japan.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.240
They developed a string of arcade hits with "Donkey Kong", "Ice Climbers" and "Mario Bros.", and then turned to handheld games.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.280
The "Game &amp; Watch" handhelds were one of their first hardware products, and they were extremely popular;

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.800
the other reason you have that little 2D silhouette - Mr. Game &amp; Watch - in your Smash Bros. games.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.500
Nintendo's experience in licensing the "Odyssey", plus its success with the Game &amp; Watch handheld,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.100
led the company to develop a new game console for the Japanese market,

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.720
which had been relatively untouched in the crash. Let's go to the Thought Bubble!

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.660
Nintendo's new console debuted in Japan as the brightly colored, red-and-white "Famicom"

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.960
or "Family Computer Home Gaming Console".

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.340
It sold more than 2.5 million copies by 1985, which led Nintendo to consider the North American market.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.620
In 1985, the company introduced the Nintendo Entertainment System, or "NES".

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.620
They were so wary of backlash from the crash and competition from the home computer markets,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.080
that they removed all mentions of video games.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.960
To distance the product from the recent industry crash, they invented a whole new vocabulary.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.540
Consoles were called "Control Decks", and game cartridges were called "Game Packs".

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.600
The system was colored gray, so it looked like a serious computing device.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.520
It loaded games from the front, like a VCR, and not top-down like previous consoles.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.200
They sold the device in toy stores rather than electronic stores, and made no-risk deals with American retailers.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.800
The system had a pretty sweet futuristic light gun, known as the "NES Zapper",

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.060
(Take that, "Duck Hunt"!) and R.O.B., the "Robotic Operating Buddy", who seemed cool but only played two games.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.760
It was really the consumer response, they made the NES succeed.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.140
Nintendo's surveys of people who bought the system in the New York City Area in 1985

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.700
indicated that more than 90% of those who bought the NES would recommend it to friends and family.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.820
One year after the NES debuted, Nintendo sold over 1.8 million units.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.600
By 1989, Nintendo had a 75-80% share of the 3.4 billion dollar U.S. video game market.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.700
It was clear that the U.S. gaming industry had returned, and Nintendo was Player One. Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.660
Nintendo's real success, though, was its ability to create a culture around itself and its games.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.360
The first thing they did was to ensure they wouldn't make the mistakes of the past.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.700
Atari suffered because they didn't monitor third-party developers, some of which made terrible, rushed games that flooded the market.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.540
That's one of the reasons why we had the crash.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.660
So Nintendo tightly controlled the games that appeared on its system with the official "Seal of Quality".

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.880
These golden seals told players that they held a quality product.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.620
Nintendo wouldn't let Third Party developers make NES games unless they agreed to a contract

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.140
to make games only for Nintendo for two years and to only make five games a year for the system.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.060
These were seen as quality controls.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.760
They enforced this with a special computer chip called the "10NES"

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.000
that controlled what games would work on the system.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.900
Though, later, developers got around them.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.440
This allowed for quality games that created loyalty in the fanbase.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.100
Players trusted that Nintendo games would be fun, look great and would actually work.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.200
... with some exceptions... LJN...

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.940
Nintendo also encouraged the loyalty of its customers by creating the "Nintendo Fun Club",

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.660
which sent users a newsletter with gameplay tips and news about popular and upcoming games.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.780
The newsletter was a success. With subscriptions nearing 600,000 by the end of 1987.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.320
They replaced this newsletter with "Nintendo Power" magazine in 1988.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.520
In Nintendo Power, you could write letters to the editor, enter contests, get exclusive merch and comics,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.160
get advice from gameplay counsellors...

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.160
This helped create a special Nintendo community for players to exist.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.060
And the crucial element of Nintendo's success was the quality of its games.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.000
Advanced technology allowed for more detailed graphics and sound, and longer and more complex games.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.700
Games like "Super Mario Bros.", "Legend of Zelda", "Kid Icarus" and "Metroid"

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.380
captivated players and gave them hours of gameplay.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.360
Characters like "Q*bert" and "Pac-Man" were cute, but they didn't have a lot of back story.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.480
Mario and Luigi, from "Super Mario Bros.", were plumbers running around the Mushroom Kingdom

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.300
trying to save Princess Peach, or "Princess Toadstool" back then, from Bowser, King of the Koopas.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.600
Okay, it's not like it's Les Misérables or anything,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.500
but it was something for players to get attached to and connect with.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.720
And audiences definitely connected with the game,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.360
"Super Mario Bros." has sold over 40 million copies since its release.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.260
Now, while the Super Mario Bros. were hopping around the Mushroom Kingdom,

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.180
"The Legend of Zelda" opened the world of Hyrule to players.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.120
The game had varied environments, like forests, deserts and dungeons, that unfolded in every direction.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.460
Now, while Mario constantly moved from left to right in his race to save the princess from the evil beast, Bowser,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.700
players could move Link in any direction on his quest to save Princess Zelda from the evil beast Ganon.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.100
Nintendo had a thing for saving princesses from evil beasts.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.840
This sense of exploring a giant video game world was also new to players.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.400
In The Legend of Zelda the aduience
was in charge of the pace of play.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.800
They could go where they wanted and take as much time as they wanted in the land of Hyrule.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:17.640
In Metroid, Samus explored the open-ended planet of Zebes, with an entire ecosystem of Metroids and other aliens to fight.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.400
This complex game had multiple endings, and areas that were only accessible after players found certain power-ups.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.240
And speaking of Metroid, we're gonna play a little bit right now.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.920
So, watch out, Mother Brain! It's time to level up!

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.100
Ooooh!
Listen to that eerie music! Whooo!

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.240
That was what was interesting about Metroid:
Unlike some of the other NES games,

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.720
Metroid had this dark, eerie feel and the music played a large part in that.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.560
All right, I'm gonna jump right into this.
But which way do I go?! [CHUCKLES]

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.000
So you could go left, you could go right, up, down...

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.240
Because they were open-world, you had these giant maps as part of the game.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.780
And that's why Nintendo Power was such a big deal, because you could get secret information from Nintendo Power,

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.520
that you couldn't find anywhere else, on how to play some of these games.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.500
Aaah!
[Laughter]

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.960
Back off, man, back off!

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.540
No!
[Laughter]

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:11.860
Now I'm just casually playing through the game but what's interesting about games like "Metroid"

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.320
is that people have played them so many times and know the maps so well

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.740
that they've actually started doing "Speed Runs", where they'll just try to get through it as fast as possible.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.060
And the reason why you even had speed runners, or just people being able to find every single secret in the game,

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:27.320
is because you had this nice home experience of playing these games.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.700
And another reason that "Metroid" had replayability was because it had five different endings.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.460
And what was very fascinating about some of those endings was that it revealed

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.700
something that we all know now but didn't know back then: That Samus is female!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.660
She gets to join the ranks with Ms. Pac-Man.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.000
So, that's Metroid. I guess Mother Brain is gonna live another day 'cause we're gonna move on

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.420
but it's definitely fun to revisit this game.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.720
Metroid, Super Mario Bros., Duck Hunt, Kid Icarus, The Legend of Zelda...

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.180
Nintendo brought gaming back with excitement. And Excite Bike!

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.900
And a level of commitment to quality that brought the video game industry back from the brink.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.080
Nintendo's games showcased improvements in underlining game technology

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.360
but they also reflected a maturing industry.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.320
With these new tools, game designers created immersive worlds and empowered players as never before.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.040
To borrow Nintendo's trademark advertising slogan: "Now you're playing with power!"

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.640
But Nintendo won't be alone in the video game race for long,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.480
thanks to another company with a little blue hedgehog. We'll see you next time!

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.580
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacey Emigholz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana,

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.620
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:34.100
