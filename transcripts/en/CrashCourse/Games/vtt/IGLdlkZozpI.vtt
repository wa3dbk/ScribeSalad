00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
Hi, I'm Andre Meadows, and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.480
Today we're going to start talking about the twentieth century, and the advent of computer games.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.020
But before we get into that,
let's start with a little perspective.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.840
Computers are, historically speaking anyway,
very new, and they've evolved very quickly.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.840
These days, if you have a mobile device on your person, you probably have more technology with you

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.840
than NASA had when they went to the moon!

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.740
And yes, I know that's kind of a cliché, but it's true.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.820
The Apollo Guidance Computer had a processing speed of 1 megahertz, and it only had 4 kilobytes of memory!

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.960
That means it could only hold 2048 programmed words.
Better choose those wisely.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.860
Meanwhile, an iPhone 4S has a processing speed of 800 megahertz, and a minimum memory of 16 gigabytes!

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.840
Though, to be fair, an iPhone isn't going
to get you to the moon.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.280
At least not yet. Tim Cook's got
something going, I'm pretty sure.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.300
But you won't get a signal there. Trust me.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:02.060
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.900
Historically, computers, and the games that were created for computers, are a new phenomenon,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.180
seeing as electronic computers appeared in the 1940s.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.840
And those early computers? They were some serious tools.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.580
Colossus, not to be confused with Colossus from X-Men and Deadpool,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.360
was built during World War II to break Nazi codes.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.260
And ENIAC, which is considered the first computer to be reprogrammable, it was primarily used for calculating artillery tables,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.360
that helped soldiers drop explosives on each other more accurately.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.520
But human beings have a long rich history of turning serious tools into playthings and games.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.600
Pretty much as soon as we humans invent something useful, we turn it into a game. We're fun!

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.560
Spears get turned into javelins. Auto racing was invented pretty much as soon as we had cars.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.120
We even turned dating into game shows and mobile apps! Swipe left! Swipe right! Super like!

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.400
So it seems pretty natural that computer games were invented as soon as we had computers.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.900
Now those computer games weren't like the games we have today.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.280
They weren't consoles or home computers, because there were like, ten computers.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.280
And they all belonged to the army or universities, and they all cost a lot of money.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.120
But some pioneers were creating video games, or electronic computer games, as they were called.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:16.080
Now video games, in their most basic sense, involve a game played on a computer device and projected onto some kind of video screen.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.380
The precursors to video games were computer games, that were made on giant early computers to test the machines.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.960
And before those there were electronic games,

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.700
or those games made on electronic devices without a screen or a computer running the program.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.600
And now that we've made that distinction,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.040
let's just agree to call all these electronic and computer games "video games."

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.900
Because it'll make this stuff a lot easier for me to say.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.740
We're going to start with a device known as the "Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device."

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.180
It sounds dirty, but it's not.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.860
In 1947, right after WWII, Thomas T. Goldsmith, professor of Physics and

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.340
television pioneer, and his co-worker Estle Ray Mann filed for, and received,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.560
what is considered the first patent for an electronic game with a video display.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.060
An ancestor of our modern video games.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.740
The game was a series of eight cathode-ray tubes hooked up to an oscilloscope for display,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.040
and with a set of knobs as player controls.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.340
Now, cathode-ray tubes were the technology behind those old, thick, heavy televisions.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.740
They would project a beam of light onto the oscilloscope, and the user would see an arc of light.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.660
The game simulated the firing of artillery shells,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.880
and when the "shell" reached its target, its beam would de-focus, simulating an explosion.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.180
This gave players a sense that their "missiles" had struck a target and caused damage.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.000
And that was it. The technology could only generate that beam of light,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.020
so the other part of the game was a screen overlay, which would later be a regular feature of 1970s video games.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.220
While this all sounds very fun, and had virtually unlimited market potential,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.840
The parts that went into the "Cathode-Ray Tube Amusement Device" cost a lot

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.060
of money in 1947, and mass production would have been impractical.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.280
The amusement device was never made for the public.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.060
It's like the rarest video game ever. Even more rare than "Chrono Trigger."

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.880
Another gaming first was the display of the NIMROD gaming computer on May 5, 1951

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.600
at the Festival of Britain in the "Dome of Discovery".

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.880
The Festival of Britain was sort of like the World's Fair, but just for Britain,

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.760
and just like that weirdly specific exposition to celebrate one small island in northern Europe,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.900
the NIMROD had a very specific task.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.960
It was one of the world's first gaming computers, designed and built specifically to play an ancient game called "Nim."

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.060
Surely you remember NIM from Alain Resnais' 1961 French new wave film "The Last Year At Marienbad"?

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.640
No? Then you're not a real gamer. Just kidding!

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.600
Actually the game play itself doesn't really matter.
The NIMROD was more of a proof of concept.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.860
As one of the earliest gaming computers that the public could interact with,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.920
it helped show people that computers could be fun, and it inspired future computer scientists and game developers.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:56.620
Like in 1952, when a University of Cambridge PhD student, A.S. Douglas, developed "OXO", a graphical version of tic-tac-toe.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.300
OXO was important because it was one of the first video games to include artificial intelligence.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.080
Douglas wasn't a game designer, he just wanted to illustrate his thesis on "Interactions Between Human and Computer."

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.820
The computer moves in reaction to the player's moves, and this is the interesting artificial intelligence part,

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.180
they were not predetermined, they were made at the computer's discretion.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.620
The computer thought for itself!

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.120
[whispering] Skynet begins.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.760
So far, all of this is pretty high-minded, right?

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.140
All these games were made to demonstrate the power of computers or as part of academic research.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.060
Where's the mindless entertainment of "Burger Time"?

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.600
Okay kids, "Burger Time" was an arcade game in the 80s - you know what? Look it up.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.960
There's food in it. Walking hot dogs and eggs, it's cool.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.040
Video games made the jump to pure entertainment in 1958 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.180
in Upton New York. WIlliam Higinbotham, who had been a designer of electronic circuits

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.540
for the Manhattan Project, was tasked with entertaining students on Visitor Day.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.600
He looked through the lab for stuff that might divert the youth of 1958, with their

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.940
hula-hoops and chocolate malts... Whatever they were doin' back then...

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.780
While he was reading the manual for one of the computers in the lab,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.720
he discovered that it could calculate and visualize ballistic missile trajectories.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.620
He made the natural, logical leap, and programmed the machine to play a tennis game.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:11.240
Kids lined up to play the game and Higinbothom had a hit on his hands.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:17.160
The important thing to note here, is that Tennis for Two's success grew out of reading an instruction manual.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.180
Come on, read those manuals kids! Technical writers are working hard to make sure you understand all

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.680
the functions of your mobile device. Have the common decency to read up and become a power user!

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.480
Actually manuals are important, but that's not the point of Tennis for Two.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.980
The game was never commercialized, but it hinted at the potential of games

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:39.420
created solely for the sake of entertainment.

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.180
Ah, so a theme is clearly developing in our history of game development.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.540
The people developing these things were nerds. Awesome, awesome nerds.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.640
NERDS!

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.720
And these nerds weren't only creating a new world of computers, they were creating a culture,

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.400
and a lot of culture that sprung up around these early pioneers is still with us today.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.740
One of the best known examples of a pack of nerds creating computer culture comes

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.760
from the Tech Model Railroad Club at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.520
Let's go to the "Thought Bubble". Founded in 1946, MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.860
or "TMRC", was for students who, unsurprisingly, loved model trains,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:22.140
but on a deeper level, what they were into was technology and figuring out how things worked,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.840
and that sort of curiosity was piqued when computers started to appear in the mid-20th Century,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:31.700
and the group would roam the campus at night, sneaking into labs, to learn how to use the computers.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.580
The TMRC developed a culture all their own, with jargon and everything.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.660
They described broken equipment as "munged", they called rolling chairs "bunkies",

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.740
and, famously, they called practical jokes or impressive feats "hacks", and they called

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.300
the people that pulled off those hacks, "hackers". Exactly.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.120
I know what you're thinking, just like the 1995 movie staring Angelina Jolie as Acid Burn.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.680
In 1961, TMRC member Steve Russell, also known as "Slug", set out to make the biggest hack

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.380
of all, a game. He combined his love of "B"-grade sci-fi with his knowledge of the group's favorite computer

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:08.320
on campus, the Programmable Data Processor 1, or "PDP-1", to create "Space War!"

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.320
Yes, the title includes the exclamation mark.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.440
This game involved two ships, the Needle and Wedge, trying to blow each other up while flying

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:21.140
around a gravitational point. The entire club got involved and members all worked to expand and improve it.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:27.460
The game proved to be so successful that it became part of the PDP-1 operating system and was used to test new computers.

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.740
Slug graduated, got a job in computer security computer security,

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.900
and never patented Space War! because he thought there would be no money in video games.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.080
He was wrong.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.000
Thanks Thought Bubble. Man, I wish I had a PDP-1 around here so I could play some Space War!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.400
That'd be pretty sweet. Whoa! Space War! Exclamation point! Ha! I guess it's time for us to Level-Up!

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.060
So this is "Slug" Russell's game, and those are the two ships, the Needle and the Wedge.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.400
They're inspired by ships from the pulp science fiction books that Russell loved.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:03.280
Alright, I'm gonna just try to move my ship over here. This is 1960s' graphics

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.360
and video game technology, ladies and gentleman!

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:14.520
Behold the fascination of two small, shaped objects shooting at each other.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:22.120
Alright, getting closer, getting closer, I think. I don't know, there we go. Just shoot my little -

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.320
Yay! I got sucked into the gravity! [Laughter] Anyway, what's really interesting about

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.560
Space War! is that it inspired
something called "Galaxy Game."

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.040
Now that was the first coin-operated video game. It was basically just Space War!,

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:42.280
but it was on a newer computer and it was housed in a fiberglass cabinet and people had to pay 10 cents to play it.

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:47.540
Oh we're coming to clip. Oh! We went into the gravity together,

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.740
like friends that just tried to kill each other. SPACE WAR!

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.780
Galaxy Game lived at the Student Union in Stanford University from 1971 through 1979

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:00.340
and large groups of students would gather together to watch this! [Laughs]

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:06.120
Occasionally, the school had to install closed-circuit TV screens so that people in the back could watch THIS!

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.780
This game! Space War! Exclamation point. Okay, this is all the Space War! I can handle.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.660
I gotta stop now. Hey, it was a simpler time back then, but, no DLC.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:21.500
Now, these, early examples of electronic and video games aren't interesting because they're the greatest games ever made,

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:28.340
I mean Space War! is okay, I guess, but it sets the stage for the explosion in video gaming

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.980
that we're going to be talking about next time. That explosive growth and the migration

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.020
of video gaming from computer labs, to arcades, to living rooms and popular culture

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:40.180
definitely has a lot to do with the human desire to turn our technology into games

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:45.740
and seek diversion and fun, but it also has a lot to do with the coin slot on that

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:51.720
Galaxy Game in the Stanford University Student Union, and the lines of students eager to pay to play.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.520
I'm talkin' money, baby! Profit, man! That's what brought video games into the mainstream.

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.400
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.780
Crash Course Games is filmed in the Chad and Stacy Emigholtz Studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.900
and it's made with the help of all these nice people.
