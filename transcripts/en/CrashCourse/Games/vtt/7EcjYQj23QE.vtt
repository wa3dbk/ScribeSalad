00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hi I’m Andre Meadows and this is Crash Course Games.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.940
If you’ve ever stayed home sick on a weekday and channel surfed, you’re probably familiar with today’s topic: game shows.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:17.600
While it might seem like there’s not much substance to the genre that brought us such shows as Cash Cab and Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?, they’ve actually been an important part of United States culture since the 1920s.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.700
Now game shows are slightly different from
the other games we’ve discussed in this series.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.260
You’re probably more likely to play Poker
in your lifetime than be a contestant on Jeopardy.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.500
But that doesn’t mean that they don’t
impact our lives.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.220
In fact, according to research, watching a game show might not be that much different than actually playing one.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:41.460
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.020
Game shows started on an ancient device known
as the radio.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.920
Back then, they were known as quiz shows.

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:50.449
And their predecessors were activities like
puzzles, spelling bees, and contests.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:59.249
In the 1920s, some radio shows started to incorporate question and answer segments, though they didn’t become truly popular until 1935 on NBC’s Vox Pop.

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:01.870
The show brought in regular people to answer
questions for prizes.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.780
Not only was this the first quiz show, it's considered one of the first shows to use audience participation.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.020
By the end of the decade, quiz shows were on all the major radio networks, and it wasn’t just an American phenomenon.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.280
In 1937, the Inter-regional Spelling Competition
premiered on BBC Radio.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.040
England also had the first TV game show, 1938’s
Spelling Bee.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.080
Two major game show varieties evolved.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.680
Quiz shows were a pretty simple question-and-answer
format.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.000
A popular example was the radio show Winner
Take All, which premiered in 1946.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.280
In the game, a host asked a question to two contestants, then whoever buzzed in first could answer.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.760
This is a mechanic we see in many game shows
up to this day.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.380
Then, there were panel shows featuring celebrity
panelists.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.820
So, instead of an ordinary contestant, these
people might be experts or comedians.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.560
The first-ever show of this genre was 1938’s
Information Please.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.240
Audience members submitted questions for the
panelists to answer.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.740
People who sent in questions that got used
would win money.

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.669
And if the questions stumped the panel, they
won even more.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:56.940
Modern examples of panel shows include Match
Game and Hollywood Squares.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:06.780
I should note here that quiz shows also evolved into some other categories including giveaway shows (which were less knowledge-based) and stunt programs (in which contestants attempted a certain stunt).

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.320
In the 1930s, social scientist Herta Herzog set out to learn why people tuned into these types of shows.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.100
She interviewed eight women and three men
about the radio program Professor Quiz.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.010
And, she found some similarities between the
quiz show listeners.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.820
They preferred to listen to a contestant who was most like themselves a.k.a. the “average” person.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:29.520
And they tended to be competitive; when a contestant made a mistake, it often caused a boost in the listener’s self-esteem.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:38.860
This is an interesting distinction – even though audience members aren’t actively playing in a game show, they still experience the competitive urges that accompany many other types of games that we’ve discussed in this series.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.480
We’ll delve into some more science a little later,
but for now: BACK TO HISTORY.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.020
Above all, these shows were entertainment.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.820
And the ones with more comedic elements tended
to do better as the genre developed.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.640
In 1946, journalist Maurice Zolotow referenced this phenomenon in an article for the Saturday Evening Post.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:01.960
He wrote, “Today a quiz program is mainly designed to exhibit slices of life, to present a cross section of strange, wonderful, bizarre and queer specimens of humanity.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.050
Frequently the dumber a contestant is, the
funnier he sounds on the air.”

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.070
Sounds a little bit like the Real Housewives
and Bachelorette contestants, doesn’t it?

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.100
Which isn’t a coincidence – we’ll get
into that later.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.450
Zolotow wasn’t totally wrong.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.330
Eventually, stunt and giveaway shows started
gaining on the original quiz show format.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.720
Audiences wanted something flashy – like people winning $1,000 by sheer random luck on the radio show Pot o’ Gold.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.760
And what the audience wants matters because these shows have always been supported by advertisers.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:33.500
So it’s probably obvious based on how many examples I’ve just given you, but these shows were hugely popular – they even changed the lifestyles of some Americans.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.660
For example, Pot o’ Gold called people randomly
on Tuesday nights.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.000
Just answering the phone got you the $1,000.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.520
If not, you received $100 as a consolation
prize.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.600
There were noticeable reductions in phone calls made on Tuesday because people didn't want to tie up their phone lines in case they had won.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.720
There was also a drop in movie theatre attendance because people wanted to stay home, just in case.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.800
It got to the point where some theatre owners
started offering their own consolation prizes.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.280
If Pot o’ Gold happened to call a person while they were at the movies, the owner promised to give them the $1,000.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.200
In the 1940s, quiz shows popped up on American television where they became the thing to watch.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.980
Some earned up to a 50% rating share in the early days, meaning that half of U.S. televisions were tuned in.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:17.360
But these quiz shows encountered some setbacks, most notably in the 1950s when they went through a huge scandal.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:23.340
A few quiz shows were at its center involving rigged contests including The $64,000 Question and Dotto.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.140
But, we’re going to focus on a program called
Twenty-One.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.360
As I mentioned earlier, these shows were important to advertisers, who wanted good ratings, and for Twenty-One, they were falling.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.160
Producers knew that good numbers came when the shows were exciting and the audience’s favorite contestants won.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.100
In this case, that contestant was a 30-year-old
man named Charles Van Doren.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.780
Before appearing on the show in the late 1950s, he was a relatively well-known English professor at Columbia.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.500
So you can probably guess what happened: the
producers staged the show.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.140
They gave Van Doren the answers and they told
his opponent, Herb Stempel, to lose on purpose.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:03.800
Stempel later recalled that they gave him, “this old, ill-fitting suit and this Marine-type haircut was to make me appear as what you would call today, a nerd, a square."

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.810
He was made to look less attractive than his
opponent – true audience manipulation.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.180
The producers didn’t script just one show
either.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:20.100
Van Doren won episode after episode, earning a total of $128,000 on a streak going from November 28th, 1956 through March 11th, 1957.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.720
Eventually he “lost,” but the ordeal earned
him a three-year contract with NBC.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.400
Soon after, Stempel (and contestants on other fixed shows) came forward with the truth, igniting a huge scandal.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.940
President Dwight D. Eisenhower called it,
“a terrible thing to do to the American public.”

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.860
It might not sound so shocking to you, since we’re all pretty accustomed to not-real reality television.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.260
But, before this moment, the majority of Americans didn’t have the same level of skepticism when it came to entertainment.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.020
They took radio and television at face value.

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.440
In 1960, an amendment was added to the Communications Act of 1934, outlawing prearranged outcomes

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.169
“with intent to deceive the listening or
viewing public.”

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:05.139
Shows could no longer legally “supply to any contestant in a purportedly bona fide contest of intellectual knowledge or intellectual skill any special and secret assistance.”

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.720
These strict regulations led the networks
to create standards and practices departments.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.130
And by the 1960s most quiz shows were moved
from primetime television to daytime and rebranded.

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.340
That’s part of the reason why you’re more likely to hear the term “game show” than “quiz show” now.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:26.140
Sure, traditional question-and-answer quiz show formats remained, but there was also the introduction of many “game shows” which require more specific skills and rules.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:35.820
Olaf Hoerschelmann, author of Rules of the Game: Quiz Shows and American Culture, views that as a huge shift – the shows went from being highbrow to being perceived as “entertainment forms with low prestige."

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.300
They also became flashier

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:43.480
The new goal was to redirect attention from daytime household tasks to the television, so music and sound effects became mainstays.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.500
[sound effect noises]

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.980
Tons of shows that you can still watch today
began during this era.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.550
Jeopardy! premiered in 1964 on NBC.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.750
The Price Is Right began in 1956 on NBC before
moving to ABC, then CBS.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.810
And also dating shows like The Dating Game
emerged in the mid-1960s.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:10.520
Jumping forward to the 1990s, another innovation came to the format with increased audience participation in the form of call-in 900-numbers.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.639
And we can’t talk about shows that incorporated phones without talking about Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? and American Idol.

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.110
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:22.670
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? was originally a British game show, which ran from 1998 through 2014.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.450
By 2003, 70 countries had franchised it.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.410
It was an equally stressful show in every country,
as we know from the movie Slumdog Millionaire.

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.250
The U.S. version first aired on ABC in August
1999, hosted by Regis Philbin.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:39.910
It was the most watched series from 1999-2000,
getting up to 30 million weekly viewers.

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:44.470
In four years, it earned ABC an estimated
$300 million in profits.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:51.240
Game shows were BACK, and this represented a larger shift in American television in general: people wanted big prizes and reality.

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.560
In 1999, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? gave
out a million dollar prize.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:02.440
Previously, the most money given out on an American game show was $312,700 on Tic-Tac-Dough in 1980.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:10.000
During the same era, more shows with a similar competition format and huge prizes arrived in the U.S., but these were branded as reality shows.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.940
Examples include American Idol, (another show originated from Britain), which aired in 2002 on Fox.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:19.740
It was the most watched series from 2003-2011
consecutively.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.000
And then there was the hit show Survivor.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.479
It aired on CBS in 2000, and it was inspired
by a Swedish show called Expedition Robinson.

00:08:26.479 --> 00:08:29.810
So, what’s the difference between a game
show and a “reality show”?

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.030
Well, it’s up for debate.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.000
Reality shows have their origins in game shows,
so many consider them part of the genre.

00:08:35.009 --> 00:08:39.909
The games I listed are often known as “reality
competition shows” or “reality game shows.”

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:43.689
Typically, when there’s a competition involved,
they’re viewed as offshoots from game shows.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:46.500
But something more documentary-style Keeping
Up with the Kardashians, aren’t.

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:47.680
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.780
All right, so now that we’ve covered game show history, we need to talk about its overall impact.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.700
Unlike some of the other forms of gaming we’ve talked about in this series, there are a couple different types of relationships a person can have with a game show.

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:00.019
There are the in-studio players and the audience.

00:09:00.019 --> 00:09:03.619
Let’s start with in-studio players, otherwise
known as the contestants.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:10.060
Something that sets game shows apart from the other games we’ve discussed is that there’s a camera focused on the player, so there’s added stress to the situation.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.880
And the stakes are also extreme.

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.560
Often times, contestants are playing for big
money and fabulous prizes.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.840
You can take a risk in a videogame, you just
restart.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.440
But you take a risk in a game show, you could
lose a potential million dollars.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.980
In 2008, the American Economic Review published a study addressing how people handle those stakes.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.300
The authors focused on the risk-taking behaviors
of contestants on Deal Or No Deal.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.820
If you’ve never seen it, a contestant picks
one briefcase out of around 26 options.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:38.020
Each has an amount of money in it (from one cent to a million dollars in the American version, but it varies from country to country).

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:41.360
Then, the player chooses briefcases to open
revealing what ISN’T in theirs.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.180
Periodically, they receive offers to buy their
briefcase; then they have to make a choice.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.900
They have to decide whether to sell it, Deal, or keep playing in hopes of earning more money, No Deal.

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:57.279
The researchers found that quote, “Risk aversion decreases after earlier expectations have been shattered by unfavorable outcomes or surpassed by favorable outcomes.”

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:04.560
Basically, if a contestant opens the highest value briefcases first OR the lowest value ones, they’re going to be more prone to taking risks.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:06.960
There’s an “important role of previous
outcomes.”

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.220
Though it’s worth noting that there’s
variety from contestant to contestant.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.639
If they all acted the same, it would be a
pretty boring show.

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:15.220
We’ll get into this a bit more when we talk
about gambling.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:23.540
A similar study was conducted in 1995 on Jeopardy! contestants and concluded that those players tend to have minimal risk aversion, also known as “risk-neutrality.”

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.150
We don’t know why these players are different
than Deal or No Deal ones.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:30.980
There might be a difference in contestant knowledge – Jeopardy contestants are probably aware of their own intellect.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.240
And it’s a game you can practice for.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.220
No amount of practice is going to ensure that you pick the million dollar suitcase in Deal or No Deal.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.380
It might also just be a matter of what type
of person is attracted to what game show.

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:46.200
Perhaps Jeopardy contestants are more steady in their willingness to take risks and Deal or No Deal ones are less consistent.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.520
Of course you don’t have to be on a game
show to benefit from one.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:56.940
In 2011, researchers tested the knowledge of fifth-year medical students with one group learning through a lecture and another through a Jeopardy-style game.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:02.940
The researchers found that information retention was much higher in the group that learned the material in Jeopardy as opposed to the lecture.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.340
Now let’s talk about the audience watching
the game shows.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.600
I mentioned one study on the audience earlier which concluded that listeners of a quiz show experienced a competitive rush.

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:16.620
From the genre’s early beginnings, producers have attempted to create as much drama, competition, and spontaneity as possible.

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:19.440
But other than that, why do we like game shows
so much?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:26.900
Well, according to research by Alan Rubin viewers also rank game shows high in terms of “entertainment, convenience, companionship, and relaxation.”

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:33.100
In another study conducted by Keith Roe and his colleagues, they narrowed down the main factors that draw people to watch game shows.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:39.840
The main factors include that they involve “ordinary people” and contain “big” prizes that can be won by demonstrating “everyday knowledge.”

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:47.280
Basically, people like game shows that show it’s possible to win a ton of money or a new car or a dream vacation by just being themselves.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:53.680
So that’s been a pretty whirlwind trip through game shows – from their radio origins in the 1920s to reality shows in the modern day.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:01.640
From answering a question, solving the puzzle, guessing the password, or getting BIG BUCKS BIG BUCKS NO WHAMMYS, game shows have impacted audiences for decades.

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.860
We’ve talked before on the series about
how games are unique in their universal accessibility.

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:09.180
They’ve been enjoyed by people throughout
history and all over the world.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:15.779
And in the U.S., entertainment and media are similarly accessible to the majority of the population – they’ve always permeated throughout our culture.

00:12:15.779 --> 00:12:18.880
Honestly, there’s almost nothing more universal
than media here.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:25.240
So, while game shows might seem like a small facet of the gaming genre as a whole, you can view them as a part of something much bigger than themselves.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:32.180
And as contestants and viewers alike know, this genre commands a similar combination of entertainment, competition, and passion.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:36.100
Thanks for watching, and
we’ll see you next...blank

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:42.460
