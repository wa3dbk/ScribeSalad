00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course U.S.
History, and today, we're going to talk about slavery,
which is not funny.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.080
Yeah, so we put a lei on the eagle to
try and cheer you up, but let's face it, this
is going to be depressing.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.360
With slavery, every time you think, like,
"Aw, it couldn't have been that bad," it turns
out to have been much worse.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.920
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! But what about –

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.000
Yeah, Me from the Past, I'm going to stop you right
there, because you're going to embarrass yourself.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.640
Slavery was hugely important to America.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:29.100
I mean, it led to a civil war and it also lasted what,
at least in U.S. history, counts as a long-ass time,
from 1619 to 1865.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.080
And yes, I know there's a 1200-year-old church
in your neighborhood in Denmark, but we're not
talking about Denmark!

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.520
But slavery is most important because we still
struggle with its legacy.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
So, yes, today's episode will probably not
be funny, but it will be important.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:51.040
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.220
So the slave-based economy in the South is
sometimes characterized as having been separate from
the Market Revolution, but that's not really the case.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.900
Without southern cotton, the North wouldn't have been
able to industrialize, at least not as quickly, because
cotton textiles were one of the first industrially products.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.840
And the most important commodity in world trade
by the nineteenth century, and 3/4 of the world's
cotton came from the American South.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.800
And speaking of cotton, why has no one mentioned
to me that my collar has been half popped this entire
episode, like I'm trying to recreate the Flying Nun's hat.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.060
And although there were increasingly fewer slaves
in the North as northern states outlawed slavery,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.120
cotton shipments overseas made northern
merchants rich.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.820
Northern bankers financed the purchase of
land for plantations.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.980
Northern insurance companies insured slaves
who were, after all, considered property, and
very valuable property.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.820
And in addition to turning cotton into cloth
for sale overseas, northern manufacturers
sold cloth back to the South,

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.120
where it was used to clothe the very slaves
who had cultivated it.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.200
But certainly the most prominent effects of
the slave-based economy were seen in the South.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.000
The profitability of slaved-based agriculture,
especially King Cotton, meant that the South
would remain largely agricultural and rural.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.360
Slave states were home to a few cities, like
St. Louis and Baltimore, but with the exception
of New Orleans,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.260
almost all southern urbanization took place in the upper
South, further away from the large cotton plantations.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.220
And slave-based agriculture was so profitable
that it siphoned money away from other economic
endeavors.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.300
Like, there was very little industry in the
South.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.230
It produced only 10% of the nation's manufactured
goods.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.880
And, as most of the capital was being plowed into
the purchase of slaves, there was very little room for
technological innovation, like, for instance, railroads.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.760
This lack of industry and railroads would
eventually make the South suck at the Civil
War, thankfully.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.080
In short, slavery dominated the South, shaping
it both economically and culturally, and slavery
wasn't a minor aspect of American society.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:42.120
By 1860, there were four million slaves in
the U.S., and in the South, they made up one
third of the total population.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.320
Although in the popular imagination, most plantations
were these sprawling affairs with hundreds of slaves,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.200
in reality, the majority of slaveholders
owned five or fewer slaves.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.560
And, of course, most white people in the South owned
no slaves at all, though, if they could afford to, they
would sometimes rent slaves to help with their work.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.040
These were the so-called yeoman farmers who
lived self-sufficiently, raised their own food, and
purchased very little in the Market Economy.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.220
They worked the poorest land and, as a result,
were mostly pretty poor themselves.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.400
But even they largely supported slavery,
partly, perhaps, for aspirational reasons,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.280
and partly because the racism inherent to the system
gave even the poorest whites legal and social status.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.700
And southern intellectuals worked hard to
encourage these ideas of white solidarity
and to make the case for slavery.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.360
Many of the founders, a bunch of whom you'll remember,
held slaves, saw slavery as a necessary evil.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:37.280
Jefferson once wrote, quote, "As it is, we
have the wolf by the ear, and we can neither
hold him, nor safely let him go.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.380
Justice is on one scale, and self-preservation
in the other."

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.740
The belief that justice and self-preservation
couldn't sit on the same side of the scale
was really opposed to the American idea,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.080
and, in the end, it would make the Civil War inevitable.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.380
But as slavery became more entrenched in
these ideas of liberty and political equality were
embraced by more people,

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.520
some southerners began to make the case
that slavery wasn't just a necessary evil.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.100
They argued, for instance, that slaves benefited
from slavery.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.700
Because, you know, because their masters fed
them and clothed them and took care of them
in their old age.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.760
You still hear this argument today, astonishingly.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.340
In fact, you'll probably see asshats in the
comments saying that in the comments.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.920
I will remind you, it's not cursing if you
are referring to an actual ass.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:26.020
This paternalism allowed masters to see themselves
as benevolent and to contrast their family-oriented
slavery with the cold, mercenary Capitalism
of the free-labor North.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:33.310
So yeah, in the face of rising criticism of
slavery, some southerners began to argue that the
institution was actually good for the social order.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.540
One of the best-known proponents of this view
was John C. Calhoun, who, in 1837, said this
in a speech on the Senate floor:

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.460
"I hold that, in the present state of civilization,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.360
where two races of different origin and
distinguished by color and other physical differences
as well as intellectual, are brought together,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.160
the relation now existing in the slave-holding states
between the two is, instead of an evil, a good.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.960
A positive good."

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.560
Now, of course, John C. Calhoun was a fringe
politician, and nobody took his views particularly
seriously.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.520
Stan: Well, he was Secretary of State from
1844 to 1845.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.180
John: Well, I mean, who really cares about
the Secretary of State, Stan?

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.580
Danica: Eh, he was also Secretary of War from
1817 to 1825.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.230
John: All right, but we don't even have a Secretary
of War anymore, so...

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.300
Meredith: And he was Vice President from 1825
to 1832.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.890
John: Oh my god, were we insane?!

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:28.620
We were, of course, but we justified the insanity
with Biblical passages and with the examples
of the Greeks and Romans,

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.620
and with outright racism, arguing that black
people were inherently inferior to whites.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.560
And that not to keep them in slavery would
upset the natural order of things.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.140
A worldview popularized millennia ago by my
nemesis, Aristotle.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.490
God, I hate Aristotle.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.360
You know what defenders of Aristotle always
say?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.520
"He was the first person to identify dolphins."

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.400
Well, ok, dolphin identifier.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.620
Yes, that is what he should be remembered
for, but he's a terrible philosopher!

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.120
Here's the truth about slavery:

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.180
It was coerced labor that relied upon intimidation
and brutality and dehumanization.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.040
And this wasn't just a cultural system, it
was a legal one.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:09.860
I mean, Louisiana law proclaimed that a slave
"owes his master... a respect without bounds,
and an absolute obedience."

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.680
The signal feature of slaves' lives was work.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:20.300
I mean, conditions and tasks varied, but all
slaves labored, usually from sunup to sundown,
and almost always without any pay.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.370
Most slaves worked in agriculture on plantations,
and conditions were different, depending on
which crops are grown.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.460
Like, slaves on the rice plantations of South
Carolina had terrible working conditions,

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.580
but they labored under the task system, which meant
that once they had completed their allotted daily work,
they would have time to do other things.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.960
But lest you imagine this is like how we have
work and leisure time, bear in mind that they
were owned and treated as property.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.880
On cotton plantations, most slaves worked
in gangs, usually under the control of an overseer,
or another slave who was called a "driver."

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.300
This was back-breaking work done in the southern sun
and humidity, and so it's not surprising that whippings –

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.880
– or the threat of them –  were often
necessary to get slaves to work.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.480
It's easy enough to talk about the brutality of slave
discipline, but it can be difficult to internalize it.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.460
Like, you look at these pictures, but because
you've seen them over and over again, they don't
have the power they once might have.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.640
The pictures can tell a story about cruelty,
but they don't necessarily communicate how
arbitrary it all was.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.700
As, for example, in this story, told by a
woman who was a slave as a young girl:

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.840
"[The] overseer... went to my father one morning
and said, "Bob, I'm gonna whip you this morning."

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.100
Daddy said, "I ain't done nothing," and he
said, "I know it, I'm going to whip you to
keep you from doing nothing,"

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:33.760
and he hit him with that cowhide – you know
it would cut the blood out of you with every lick
if they hit you hard."

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.880
That brutality – the whippings, the brandings,
the rape – was real, and it was intentional,

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.120
because, in order for slavery to function,
slaves had to be dehumanized.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:51.740
This enabled slaveholders to rationalize what
they were doing, and it was hoped to reduce
slaves to the animal property that is implied
by the term "chattel slavery."

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:57.560
So the idea was that slaveholders wouldn't
think of their slaves as human, and slaves
wouldn't think of themselves as human.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.820
But it didn't work.
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:05.300
Slaves' resistance to their dehumanization
took many forms, but the primary way was by
forming families.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.920
Family was a refuge for slaves and a source of
dignity that masters recognized and sought to stifle.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:15.360
A paternalistic slave owner named Bennet H. Barrow
wrote in his rules for the Highland Plantation:

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.700
"No rule that I have stated is of more
importance than that relating to Negroes
marrying outside of the plantation...

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.500
It creates a feeling of independence."

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:28.520
Most slaves did marry, usually for life, and,
when possible, slaves grew up in two-parent
households.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.740
Single-parent households were common, though,
as a result of one parent being sold.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:40.020
In the upper South, where the economy was
shifting from tobacco to different, less labor-intensive
cash crops, the sale of slaves was common.

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.040
Perhaps one-third of slave marriages in states
like Virginia were broken up by sale.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.640
Religion was also an important part of life
in slavery.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.400
While masters wanted their slaves to learn
the parts of the Bible that talked about being
happy in bondage,

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.560
slave worship tended to focus on the stories of Exodus,
where Moses brought the slaves out of bondage,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:01.540
or Biblical heroes, who overcame great
odds, like Daniel and David.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.240
And, although most slaves were forbidden to
learn to read and write, many did anyway.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.580
And some became preachers.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:13.400
Slave preachers were often very charismatic
leaders, and they roused the suspicion of
slave owners, and not without reason.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.580
Two of the most important slave uprisings
in the South were led by preachers.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.740
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:19.450
Oh, it's time for the Mystery Document?

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:24.460
We're doing two set pieces in a row? All right.
[buzzing noise] [music]

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.540
The rules here are simple.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.010
I wanted to re-shoot that, but Stan said no.

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:30.790
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.150
If I am wrong, I get shocked with the shock
pen.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:40.800
"Since I have been in the Queen's dominions
I have been well contented, yes well contented
for sure, man is as God intended he should be.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.700
That is, all are born free and equal.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.260
This is a wholesome law, not like the southern
laws which puts man made in the image of God
on level with brutes.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.570
O, what will become of the people, and where
will they stand in the day of judgment.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:59.060
Would that the 5th verse of the 3rd chapter
of Malachi were written as with a bar of iron,

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:06.060
and the point of a diamond upon every
oppressor's heart that they might repent of this
evil, and let the oppressed go free..."

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.540
All right, it's definitely a preacher, because
only preachers have read Malachi.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.460
Probably African American, probably not someone
from the South.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:18.080
I'm going to guess that it is Richard Allen,
the founder of the African Methodist Episcopal
Church?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.920
[buzzing noise]
DAAAH, DANG IT!

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.500
It's Joseph Taper, and Stan just pointed out
to me that I should have known it was Joseph
Taper because it starts out,

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.280
"Since I have been in the Queen's dominions..."

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.880
He was in Canada. He escaped slavery to
Canada. The Queen's dominions!

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:36.440
All right, Canadians, I blame you for this,
although, thank you for abolishing slavery
decades before we did.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.580
[electric sounds] AHHH!

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:42.220
So, the Mystery Document shows one of the
primary ways that slaves resisted their oppression:
by running away.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.220
Although some slaves like Joseph Taper escaped
for good by running away to northern free states,

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:50.480
or even to Canada, where they wouldn't
have to worry about fugitive slave laws,

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:55.820
even more slaves ran away temporarily, hiding out
in the woods or the swamps, and eventually returning.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:01.660
No one knows exactly how many slaves escaped
to freedom, but the best estimate is that a thousand
or so a year made the journey northward.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:07.680
Most fugitive slaves were young men, but the
most famous runaway has been hanging out behind
me all day long: Harriet Tubman.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.620
Harriet Tubman escaped to Philadelphia at
the age of 29, and over the course of her life,

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:17.380
she made about 20 trips back to Maryland
to help friends and relatives make the journey
north on the Underground Railroad.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.420
But a more dramatic form of resistance to
slavery was actual, armed rebellion, which
was attempted.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.960
Now, individuals sometimes took matters into
their own hands and beat or even killed their
white overseers or masters.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:33.780
Like Bob, the guy who received the arbitrary
beating, responded to it by killing his overseer
with a hoe.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.800
But that said, large-scale slave uprisings
were relatively rare.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.040
The four most famous ones all took place in a
35-year period at the beginning of the 19th century.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.910
Gabriel's Rebellion in 1800 – which we've
talked about before – was discovered before
he was able to carry out his plot.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:52.360
Then, in 1811, a group of slaves upriver from
New Orleans seized cane, knives, and guns, and
marched on the city before militia stopped them.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:59.460
And in 1822, Denmark Vesey, a former slave
who had purchased his freedom, may have organized
a plot to destroy Charleston, South Carolina.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:05.480
I say "may have" because the evidence against him
is disputed and comes from a trial that was not fair.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.600
But regardless, the end result of that trial
was that he was executed, as were 34 slaves.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:15.680
But the most successful slave rebellion, at
least in the sense that they actually killed some
people, was Nat Turner's in August 1831.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:21.380
Turner was a preacher, and with a group of
about 80 slaves, he marched from farm to farm
in South Hampton County, Virginia,

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:27.100
killing the inhabitants, most of whom were women
and children, because the men were attending a
religious revival meeting in North Carolina.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:34.560
Turner and 17 other rebels were captured and
executed, but not before they struck terror into the
hearts of whites all across the American South.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:42.320
Virginia's response was to make slavery worse,
passing even harsher laws that forbade slaves from
preaching, and prohibited teaching them to read.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.720
Other slave states followed Virginia's lead and, by
the 1830s, slavery had grown, if anything, more harsh.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:51.560
So, this shows that large-scaled armed
resistance was – Django Unchained aside –

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.620
not just suicidal, but also a threat to loved
ones and, really, to all slaves.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:59.920
But, it is hugely important to emphasize that
slaves did resist their oppression.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.660
Sometimes this meant taking up arms, but usually
it meant more subtle forms of resistance,

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:08.840
like intentional work slowdowns or sabotaging
equipment, or pretending not to understand instructions.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:16.060
And, most importantly, in the face of systematic
legal and cultural degradation, they re-affirmed
their humanity through family and through faith.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.520
Why is this so important?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.640
Because too often in America, we still talk
about slaves as if they failed to rise up,

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.080
when, in fact, rising up would not have made
life better for them or for their families.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:34.480
The truth is, sometimes carving out an identity as a human being in a social order that is constantly seeking to dehumanize you, is the most powerful form of resistance.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:45.140
Refusing to become the chattel that their masters believed them to be is what made slavery untenable and the Civil War inevitable, so make no mistake, slaves fought back.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.220
And in the end, they won.
I'll see you next week.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.760
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.250
The script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:54.160
Our associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.060
The show is written by my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:58.779
And our graphics team is Thought Cafe.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:04.140
Every week, there's a new caption to the Libertage,
but today's episode was so sad that we couldn't
fit a Libertage in...

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.280
UNTIL NOW!
[Libertage Rock Music]

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.709
Suggest Libertage caption in comments, where
you can also ask questions about today's video that
will be answered by our team of historians.

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:18.100
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my home town, don't forget to be abolitionist.
