00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.100
 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.040
Hey, there! I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Theatre, and today,

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:09.005
we're feeling stressed, but also romantic

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.985
and sometimes classical. It's an emotional

00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:18.300
whatever mileage is in German because we're exploring the German theatre of the late 18th and early 19th centuries

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.800
when playwrights rebelled against the enlightenment and bourgeois society

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.595
by writing some really dark plays.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.360
We'll explore the enduring conflict between intellect and emotion, and between society and the individual .

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.820
We'll meet a funny little guy in a hat named Hanswurst.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:34.555
Lights up.

00:00:43.565 --> 00:00:46.535
Germany didn't establish a theatre of its own until late.

00:00:46.535 --> 00:00:49.175
That's probably because Germany itself wasn't

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.160
really established until late.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.960
The 30 years war ended in 1648, leaving Germany a mess

00:00:55.005 --> 00:00:58.045
of three hundred separate provinces and city states.

00:00:58.045 --> 00:01:01.015
Most of them were devastated. It wasn't until the mid 1800

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.840
that the nation was finally unified.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.055
In the meantime, German nobles who wanted theatre imported

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.880
it from France and Italy. Common people had to make do with bare grounds stuff.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.700
Some of that stuff was provided by English actors.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.940
English plays weren't so popular.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.960
With Frederic Degrey calling Shakespear plays:

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.360
Oof! Sorry, Canada. Not so great, Frederic, if you ask me.

00:01:25.365 --> 00:01:28.145
But travelling English clowns were a hit!

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:32.920
especially when they developed German characters like Starkfish[?] and Pickle Herring.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.280
hehe... Pickle Herring...

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.265
Eventually Germany developed its own stock clown:

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:40.255
HANSWURST or John Sausage (&gt;o&gt;)

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.960
A Bavarian fool who worn a green hat and drank a lot of beer.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.575
And that was pretty much the highest achievement of German theatre until

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.640
the mid 18th century. The first serious German troop, the [?], showed how serious they were

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.300
by barbecuing Hanswurst in effigy.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.325
But then they stopped making money

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:02.820
so they had to bring Hanswurst's plays back.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.335
What can you say? The people wanted more John Sausage.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.280
German's first serious playwright was G.E. Lessing who was also the world's first dramaturg

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.000
In the mid 18th century, inspired by English playwrights, he wrote bourgeois comedies and tragedies about middle class German Characters.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.700
These were considered amazingly realistic, and finally attracted middle class audience to the theatre..

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:30.520
Around this time, some Germany first permanent theatres were build, which gave Lessing and other German playwrights a place to show their stuff like:

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.160
Like sentimentalism in England. Lessing's work reflected the good old enlightenment idea

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.120
that people are mostly good and just need a little moral hand-holding.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.480
The playwrights who came after him were like: 
"Uh... No."

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.340
They looked around at the ravages of poverty and crime

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.680
and they argued that maybe people and society weren't so great after all.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.860
I mean... we've all been there, right?

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.480
The movement they've created was called:

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.840
"Sturm Und Drang" or "Storm and Stress"

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.840
named for a 1776 play by Friedrich M. Klinger

00:02:59.955 --> 00:03:05.825
that is nominally set during the American Revolution even though none of the characters are American.

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:09.160
It's a pretty silly play about family grudges and concealed identities,

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.040
but somewhere in there is an argument for passionate individualism,

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.520
and that's what "Sturm Und Drang" is all about.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.080
Sort of... In fact, it's hard to tell exactly what "Sturm Und Drang" is about

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.220
because as aesthetic movements go, this one wasn't the most coherent.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.720
The men who let it sort of agreed on what they were against: modern life, rationalism,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.780
but not really on what they were for, so some plays reject the unities some don't.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.680
Some of them are really emotional, but some aren't.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.100
There's an uncomfortable amount of rape and child murder, but not enough to like build a movement around.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.120
Not that you'd want to.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.940
Writers such as Friedrich Schiller and Johann Von Wolfgang Goethe were fans of this movement.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.640
Goethe wrote one of Sturm Und Drang most famous plays, Götz von Berlichingen, which was so long and so spectacular

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.515
that it was pretty much unstageable.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.480
Schiller had a scandalous success with The Robbers, which got him temporarily banned from play-writing.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:16.420
In The Robbers, an outlaw is the true hero, and it's wealthy brother who is thriving in a corrupt society who is the villain.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.620
Both Schiller and Goethe later rejected Strum Und Drang in favor what came to be known as Weimar classicism.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.955
Goethe was inspired by a trip to Italy

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.900
which convinced him that maybe classical models weren't so bad?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.300
Schiller took a decade off play-writing to read history and came to the same conclusion.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.820
Weimar classicism was a throwback to Enlightement theatre,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.615
with its faith in reason and order.

00:04:39.615 --> 00:04:42.675
Instead of using French neoclassicism as its model, though,

00:04:42.675 --> 00:04:45.825
it looked all the way back to the Greeks and Romans.

00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:55.560
Weimar classicists wanted to make a theatre so galvanizing, extraordinary, and exquisitely beautiful that it would reveal some kind of greater truth.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.260
For 26 years, Goethe also took over the actual Weimar court theatre in Weimar, Germany.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.280
Even though Goethe's plays and the plays of his admired contemporaries formed only a small part of the repertory there.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.880
He advanced the theatre in other ways by training his actors in verse speaking and more naturalistic acting.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.400
And by rejecting haphazard blocking in favor of more specific, more painterly tableaus.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:27.640
The German movement that followed Sturm Und Drang and spread across Europe in the early years of the 19th century was Romanticism.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.100
As we discussed in Crash Course: Literature, Romanticism doesn't have a lot to do with the shirtless guy on the book cover kind of romance...

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.795
Instead it was a profound reaction against enlightenment certainties

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.580
and the social transformation wrought by the industrial revolution.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:48.720
Romanticism emphasized emotions over intellect, instinct over reason, and nature over culture.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.060
Romantics drew on the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who argued that humans are at their best in a state of nature

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.520
And Immanuel Kant who wrote that we understand the world only through subjective experience

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.240
Romantics believed that humans are caught between an earthly existence and a higher spiritual existence.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.640
Nature moves us closer to that higher existence, and so can art, especially if a romantic genius is making that art.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:22.060
In fact, Playwright Frederic Schiller theorized that the only way people can reconcile the confusion between sensuality and reason and body and mind

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.600
is through art and the impulse of play.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.815
Romantic playwrights weren't interested in realism.

00:06:27.815 --> 00:06:30.955
Their plays mostly took place in an idealized past,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.820
an imagined future or a far off locale.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.080
Anywhere that, as composer Richard Wagner wrote, would allow audiences from

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:46.300
The disgusting and disheartening burden of this world of lying and fraud and hypocrisy and legalized murder."

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.820
Maybe, worth noting Richard Wagner was also a noted anti-Semite.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.180
Romantics favored Shakespearean over neoclassical models and tend to avoid hard and fast rules about unities

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.780
in their desire to represent passion and emotions.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.240
Many playwrights doubted that their plays could ever be successfully produced

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:07.400
so they wrote closet dramas that were staged only in the minds of their readers.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:14.920
Romantics playwrights, worth noting, include Ludwig Tieck who helped with new translation of Shakespeare and staged Shakespeare's plays in the Elizabethan Style.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.240
He also wrote his own plays based on folks and fairy tales.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:24.600
Then there was Heinrich von Kleistwas who [?] dropped out of school and wrote some plays including the dream-like Prince of Homburg.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.040
He wanted to have a romantic death.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.640
And after a couple of tries, he convinced a woman to enter into a suicide-pack with him.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.795
There was also Georg Büchner who wrote Danton's Death, a tragedy of the French Revolution,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:43.080
and the wild fragmentary, Woyzeck, which is like a bourgeois tragedy spiked with psychedelic before you die of typhus.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.540
I personally have been involved in 3 productions of that one.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.160
To illustrate some of these movements, we're going to look at a play that has elements of

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:57.020
Sturm Und Drang, Weimar classicism, Romanticism, and probably some other stuff, too because it's very long.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:02.100
That play is Goethe's Faust, arguably the greatest work of German dramatic literature.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.880
We're only going to at the first part of it which was published in 1808.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:11.060
Like Christopher Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, Goethe's Faust is based on an ancient German puppet play

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:16.080
about a scholar who sells his soul to the demon,  Mephistopheles in return for tenure-

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.240
I mean POWER. In return for power.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.055
But it departs from the legend and from Marlowe in pretty significant ways.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.580
Some of them involving witches and beer. Help us out Thought Bubble!

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:30.040
God bet Mephistopheles that he can't corrupt God's favorite professor, Faust.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:37.860
This dude is making himself miserable by striving for divine knowledge.  Mephistopheles is all "Corrupting is what I do best!"

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:45.800
So Meph. goes down to earth, taking the form of sinister poodle, follows Faust home to his study where makes Faust a deal.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:52.060
If Faust pledges to serve Mephistopheles in hell and  Mephistopheles will serve Faust here on Earth.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.220
Since Faust isn't one of those guys who signs in blood without reading the fine print,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.880
he stipulates that Mephistopheles can only have his soul

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:03.320
if he enjoys a moment of perfect happiness,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:08.000
and wishes that moment - "Augenblich" in German - would last forever.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.900
Mephistopheles agrees. How does Faust celebrate his new found power?

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:21.340
First, Mephistopheles doing the corrupting thing takes him out for celebratory beer and pulls a bunch pranks on some of the other drunks which Faust does not find funny.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.740
Then he takes Faust to a witcher shop[?]and gives him a potion to make him look young and hot.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:34.440
While still hot, he convinces Gretchen, an innocent country girl to sleep with him, helping Gretchen accidentally kill her mother along the way.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:39.100
Faust gets Gretchen pregnant, deserts her, and - just to make things that much worse -

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.640
kills her bother... I mean, the literal devil is involved here, after all.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:50.800
Then Faust goes out to a party at a witches's sabbath. Gretchen loses her mind, drowns her baby, and is sentenced to death.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.140
Thank you, Thought Bubble! &lt;3

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.520
That was HORRIBLE.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:59.920
Feeling at least a little regretful, Faust leaves the witch orgy and goes to Gretchen's cell to try to talk her into a prison break,

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.780
but Gretchen will not go with him, and instead commends her soul to god.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:14.040
As Faust and Mephistopheles leaves, a voice from heaven announces that Gretchen's soul is saved, which for part 1 at least is sort of a surprised happy ending?

00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:15.160
I guess...?

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.040
We can see the evident of the Sturm Und Drang movement in Faust's internal torment and in Gretchen's infanticide.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:29.120
There's recognizable Romanticism in the radical individualism of a genius hero who resists taking a complacent role in a society

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:34.880
and instead thrives for knowledge, power and connection to a higher spiritual realm... [deep breaths...]

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.735
before meeting a tragic death (obviously).

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:46.320
We can also see a deep Weimar classicism in Faust's desire for a moment of beauty so  profound and transformative that it's worth losing his soul over.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:55.320
Don't worry. Faust doesn't actually lose his soul though. In the second part after a few decades of adventures, he gets the better of the devil mostly because of a squabble over verb tense.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.720
Grammar is important people! Join us next time when we'll cheer

00:10:58.725 --> 00:11:00.200
heroes and boo villains,

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.600
and Yorick will probably get himself tied to railroad tracks because we're going to studying melodrama.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.280
And it is NOT mellow at all...

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.560
but until then...

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.175
Curtain!

00:11:10.175 --> 00:11:13.400
