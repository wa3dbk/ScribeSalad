00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.120
You know what can be kind of peculiar and
surprising?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.060
The fact that, whenever you want to shoot outside, everyone decides to mow their lawn.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.720
You know what else can be kind of peculiar
and surprising?

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.760
Water.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.760
And in the right circumstances, I could even take water that’s flowing down and spurt it straight up.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.600
How?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.280
All of these things are possible, thanks to
the study of the flow of fluids, known as Fluid Dynamics.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:41.100
[Theme Music]

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.100
By now, you’ve picked up on the fact that
-- even though we live in the physical universe

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.320
-- describing the rules of the universe sometimes requires us to pretend that certain things aren’t happening.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.660
Like the time we rolled a bunch of stuff down
a ramp, and pretended that there was no  kinetic friction.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.680
The same is true when we talk about fluids.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.980
Because, fluids in motion are dynamic and there are many, many things going on in and around them all at once.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.860
So, in order to grasp the essentials of fluid
dynamics, let’s just do some pretending, shall we?

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.970
For one thing, we’re going to consider the
fluids in our examples to be incompressible,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.200
meaning that their densities won’t change.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.840
We’re also going to assume that fluids flow
perfectly smoothly, and have no viscosity.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.300
You’ve probably heard of viscosity before:

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.680
When a fluid flows easily, like water, we say that it has a low viscosity.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.760
Fluids that don’t flow as easily, like honey, have a higher viscosity.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.460
And much like kinetic friction does in moving objects, viscosity tends to complicate things in moving fluids,

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.020
which is why we’re generally going to pretend that the fluids we’re studying don’t have any.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.720
Now, say you have some water -- which exists
under all of these hypothetical conditions

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.250
-- in a pipe, moving along smoothly.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.430
This pipe narrows about halfway through, so
that one end is narrower than the other.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.230
This shape is going to affect some of the
properties of the water’s flow,

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.030
as it passes through the narrower side of the pipe compared to the wider side.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.700
But one thing that won't change is the mass of water that’s moving through any given area in the pipe over time.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.980
This is called the mass flow rate, and it’s
always going to be the same everywhere in the pipe.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.730
That’s just because, as the water flows through the pipe, it pushes along the water in the rest of the pipe, too.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.350
So if one part of the pipe has, say, a kilogram
of water moving through it every second,

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.710
the rest of the pipe ALSO has to have a kilogram
of water moving through it every second.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.000
This fact, that the mass flow rate at one point in the pipe will be equal to the mass flow rate at any other point,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.060
is called the equation of continuity.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.680
And it can tell you a lot about the relationship between the velocity of a fluid

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.520
and the cross-sectional area of the pipe that it’s flowing through.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.100
Let’s say you’re an engineer for the Water
Department of Hypothetical City,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.120
and you need to understand the mass flow rate of hypothetical water that’s going through a certain point in your underground pipe system.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.240
But you don’t know the mass that’s going through that part of the pipe at any given moment.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.840
All you know are the water’s velocity and the area of the cross-section of that certain section of pipe.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.140
In order to describe the mass flow rate, you’ll
have to use what we know about density, area,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.750
and velocity to work some algebra magic:

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.890
First, let’s have a look at a cross section
of that point of the pipe.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.640
From our last lesson, you know that the mass of the fluid moving past this cross-sectional area, over time,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.220
is equal to its density,
times its volume.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.300
And, the volume of the fluid moving past this point is simply the area of the pipe at this cross section,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.540
times the distance the fluid
moves.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.200
And! From our episodes on the physics of motion,
you also know that the distance the fluid moves,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.420
divided by the change in time, is equal
to the fluid’s velocity.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.200
So, by putting all that together, you can
get a different version of the equation of continuity:

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.800
At any given point in the pipe, the density
of the fluid flowing through it,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.680
times the area of the pipe, times the fluid’s velocity, will be the same as for any other point in the pipe.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.319
And since you’re dealing with an incompressible fluid, the density is going to be the same for every point in the pipe anyway.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.880
So really, you’ve just figured out that
at any point in the pipe, the area of the pipe

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.580
times the fluid’s velocity will be
the same as for any other point.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.220
It’s the same thing we said before: The mass
flow rate is the same for every point in the pipe.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.500
But instead of putting that relationship
in terms of mass and time,

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.340
you’re putting it in terms of area and velocity.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.489
And, in your role as a water-department engineer,
this is important for you to know!

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.989
Because it means that, where the pipe is narrower,
the fluid will have to flow faster, in order to compensate.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.359
But here’s a weird thing:

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.339
A fluid that’s flowing really fast actually has less pressure than when it’s flowing more slowly.

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.379
Sure, it might feel like it’s exerting more
force than when it flows through a wider opening.

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:31.229
But that’s not what physicists mean when
they talk about the pressure in a pipe.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.339
They’re really talking about the pressure
on the walls of the pipe.

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:38.479
This means that, the slower the fluid flows,
the more pressure it puts on the pipe itself.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480
This is known as Bernoulli’s principle.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.080
It states that the higher a fluid’s velocity
is through a pipe,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.340
the lower the pressure on the pipe’s walls,
and vice versa.

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.050
Bernoulli also came up with what we now know
as Bernoulli’s equation.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.510
It might look kind of intimidating at first.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.530
But when you break it down, it’s actually just a way of combining a bunch of things that you’ve already learned.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.370
Bernoulli based his equation on the
concept of conservation of energy:

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.270
as a fluid flows through a pipe, it won’t gain or lose any energy.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.990
This means that, no matter where
the fluid is in the pipe,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.980
if you take all of the forms of energy that the fluid has at that point and add them up,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.140
they’ll equal the same number
as any other point in the pipe.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.619
To better understand this, have a look at how the three forms of energy in a fluid are represented in Bernoulli’s equation:

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:23.599
First, there’s pressure times volume.

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.259
In our episode on work and energy, we defined
energy as the ability to do work.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.659
And when a fluid applies pressure and moves
the volume of fluid that’s downstream, it’s doing work.

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.080
So, pressure times volume must be a form of
energy.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.360
The first term in Bernoulli’s equation takes
that energy, and divides it by volume.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.900
Which just leaves pressure.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.770
Next, a flowing fluid also has kinetic energy.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.770
When we first talked about kinetic energy, we said that it’s equal to half of an object’s mass, times its velocity squared.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.340
Again, Bernoulli divided this form of energy by volume, to get half the fluid’s density, times its velocity squared.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.400
That’s called the kinetic energy density,
and it’s the second term of Bernoulli’s equation.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.520
Finally, a flowing fluid also has the potential
energy that comes from gravity.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.780
And we’ve said before that the potential
energy from gravity is equal to

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.980
an object’s mass, times small g, times its height.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.940
When Bernoulli divided that by volume, he
got density times small g times height --

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.800
the potential energy density,
and the third term of his equation.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.940
Why divide all these terms by volume?

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.880
Well, when it comes to fluids, it’s just easier to talk about things in terms of density than it is to talk about mass.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.000
So when you look at his equation piece by
piece, you can see that Bernoulli was really

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.649
just putting conservation of energy into a
special form that would be useful for fluids.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.749
Now, let’s look at a special case of Bernoulli’s
equation, known as Torricelli’s theorem.

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:49.540
Torricelli’s theorem uses conservation of energy to find the velocity of fluid flowing from a small spout in a container.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.919
And it says that the velocity of the fluid
coming out of the spout is the same as the

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.279
velocity of a single droplet of fluid that
falls from the height of the surface of the fluid in the container.

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.139
In other words, the pressure that’s pushing
the fluid out of the spout

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.940
gives it the same velocity that it would get from the force of gravity.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.360
To see this theorem in action, let’s say you’re not a water department engineer -- you’re just YOU,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.880
and you’re watering your garden
with the water you’ve saved up in your rain barrel.

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:16.089
Your barrel doesn’t have a top, and you’re
watering your carrots and lettuce and stuff

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:18.080
from a hole -- or a spout -- in the side.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.539
Now: You want to know: What’s the velocity
of the water coming out of the spout?

00:07:21.539 --> 00:07:26.019
From Bernoulli’s equation, we know that
the sum of the pressure, kinetic energy density,

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.440
and the potential energy density of the water
at the TOP of the cooler, will equal the sum

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:33.149
of those three qualities of the water coming
out of the spout.

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:37.640
But we can simplify that relationship a bit,
to find the velocity of the fluid coming out.

00:07:37.649 --> 00:07:39.909
First, the upper surface of
the water in the barrel,

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:43.580
and the water that’s coming out of the spout, are both exposed to the atmosphere.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.559
So the pressure at those points will be the same -- it’s just the atmospheric pressure.

00:07:47.559 --> 00:07:50.319
So we can cross off the pressure from each
side of the equation.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.020
Now, there might be water coming out of the spout, but the top of the barrel has a much bigger area.

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:57.929
So the water at the top of the barrel isn’t
going to be moving very much.

00:07:57.929 --> 00:08:01.329
In fact, we can say that its velocity is basically zero.

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:05.300
Which means that the kinetic energy density
for the water at the top of the barrel is zero.

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:09.679
Finally, we can cross out the density in each
term of the equation, since it’s not changing.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.080
We’re left with a much simpler equation,
with only three terms --

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:17.300
an equation that should look VERY familiar, if you’ve watched our episodes on the physics of motion.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.869
It’s a kinematic equation!

00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:23.969
You already know the two main kinematic equations:
the definition of acceleration and the displacement curve.

00:08:23.969 --> 00:08:27.659
And you can rearrange them to get another
equation that relates displacement, velocity,

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:30.209
and acceleration -- without considering time.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:33.930
It’s exactly the same equation as the one
we just found by using Bernoulli’s equation

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:36.919
to describe the velocity of the water coming
out of the spout.

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.060
So, Torricelli’s theorem tells you that if a droplet of water fell from the same height as the top of the barrel,

00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:47.360
when it reached the level of the spout, it’d have the same velocity as the water coming out of the spout.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.280
Now you know how fast the water’s
coming out your rain barrel,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.500
and how much water you’re putting in your garden over a certain amount of time.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.240
But you want to try something fun?

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.680
Let’s turn the spout on your barrel so it’s pointing up instead of down.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.980
If the water from this spout could shoot straight up,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.780
the stream would get exactly as high as the water at the top of the barrel, before falling down to the ground.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:09.700
Today, you learned about fluids in motion,
with a focus on the continuity equation,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.280
Bernoulli’s equation, and Torricelli’s theorem.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.860
You also learned that lawn mowers are loud.
