00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.260
In June 2001, officials in London unveiled a striking new feat of engineering: the Millennium Bridge

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.720
-- a pedestrian bridge spanning the
River Thames.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.800
It promised to be very useful, and it was
cool to look at, but it had to be close almost immediately.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.480
Because when people used the bridge, it swayed back and forth dramatically, due to the force of their footsteps.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.020
Undeterred, people kept using the bridge, but as they walked they began leaning into the swaying to keep themselves from falling over.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.720
And that only made things worse.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.540
Eventually, the motion of the bridge became so severe, that the bridge took on the shape of a giant S.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.200
Essentially, a horizontal wave.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.280
The bridge had to be closed and the engineers took nearly two years to fix it the problem.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.560
So, what was wrong with the Millennium Bridge?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.580
And why didn’t the engineers foresee the
problem?

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.520
The answer lies in oscillations.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:59.420
[Theme Music]

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.500
The physics that caused the swaying of the Millennium Bridge has to do with oscillations, or back-and-forth motion.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.620
More specifically, it has to do with simple
harmonic motion:

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.820
where oscillations follow a particular, consistent pattern.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.790
But before we had the Millennium Bridge as
a real-life example,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.090
physicists often described simple harmonic motion in terms of a ball attached to a horizontal spring, lying on a table.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.230
While it’s lying there, at rest, it’s
in equilibrium.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
And when you move the ball so that it stretches
the spring, then let go,

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.430
the ball keeps moving back and forth forever...
in a frictionless world.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.440
That back-and-forth motion caused by the force
of the spring, is simple harmonic motion.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.540
Now, we want to know two things about this
oscillating ball:

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.400
What kinds of energy does it have?

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.330
And, what’s its maximum velocity?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.520
To better understand what’s happening to
the ball, let’s start with its energy.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.860
As the ball compresses and stretches the spring, both ‘kinetic energy’ and ‘potential energy’ come into play.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.120
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, and
as the ball moves, there are two points --

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.220
the turning points -- where it’s NOT moving:

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.740
One point is where the spring is compressed all the way, and the other is where it’s stretched all the way.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.920
And the distance between either of these two points, and the equilibrium point, is called the ‘amplitude’.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.600
At those two turning points, the ball won’t
have any kinetic energy, since it isn't moving.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.420
Instead, all of the ball’s energy will be
potential energy from the spring:

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.960
(half of the spring constant), times the (amplitude
squared).

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.540
Now, as the ball moves toward the middle,
its kinetic energy starts to increase,

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.640
because it’s moving faster and faster.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.030
And at the same time, its potential energy
decreases, keeping its total energy the same.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.520
And exactly in the middle of the ball’s motion -- at the equilibrium point -- its potential energy goes down to 0.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.180
The ball is back where it started, so the spring isn’t pulling on it anymore.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.079
Its kinetic energy, on the other hand, has
reached its maximum.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.399
Which means that at that point, the total
energy of the ball will be equal to

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.540
(half of its mass), times its (maximum velocity
squared).

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.460
Now we have two equations for the total energy in this oscillating spring, which we can combine into one equation.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.540
And if we use algebra to move around its variables, we can start to answer the second question we had about the ball.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.219
We wanted to know the ball’s maximum velocity,
and this equation tells us, that it’s equal

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:06.629
to the (amplitude), times the (square root
of the spring constant) (divided by its mass).

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.569
So we’ve answered our two questions
about the ball on the spring!

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.900
We know about its energy, and we have an equation for its maximum velocity.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.649
But there’s a lot more going on with this
ball than just its energy and velocity.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:21.229
It also has properties like a period,
a frequency, and an angular velocity.

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.260
Plus, its position changes with time.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.000
You might recognize those terms, because we’ve already talked about them in our episode on uniform circular motion.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.400
And that’s no coincidence!

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.920
Simple harmonic motion is actually a lot like uniform circular motion, mathematically speaking.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.440
You can see this for yourself, if you compare the ball’s motion on the spring to an object in uniform circular motion --

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.760
say, a marble moving along a ring at a constant speed.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.620
OK, I admit: It might seem like kind of a weird
comparison at first.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.620
For one thing, the ball on the spring is
moving in one dimension,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.740
while a marble moving along a circular path is in two dimensions.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.860
But what if you take that ring, and look at
it from the side?

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.260
The marble keeps moving along its circular
path.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.999
But to you, it looks like it’s just moving
back and forth along a straight line.

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:06.579
Not only that, but it looks like this marble
is stopping momentarily as it changes direction,

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.169
and moving faster as it gets closer to the
middle.

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.799
Which is exactly the same way the ball was
moving on the spring.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.400
Now, let’s take this comparison a step further.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.239
Let’s assume that the radius of the ring is the same as the amplitude of the ball’s motion on the spring.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.460
And the marble’s constant speed along the ring is equal to the maximum speed of the ball on the spring.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.220
In that case, if you did the math, you’d find that the equation for the marble’s velocity

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.800
-- when you look at it edge-on -- is exactly the same as the equation that described

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.460
the velocity of the ball on the spring.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.000
So, let’s recall what we know about uniform circular motion, to see what it can tell us about simple harmonic motion.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.540
We know that the time it takes for the marble
to move around the ring once is called the period.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.240
We also know that the period will be equal to the circumference of the ring, divided by the marble’s speed.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.420
And! The radius of the circle is the same
as the ball’s amplitude on the spring.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.540
So its circumference will be equal to two times pi times the amplitude.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.520
This means that the period will be equal to
2 times pi times the amplitude,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.940
divided by the marble’s speed -- which, again, is the same as the ball’s maximum speed as it moves on the spring.

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.309
And we can simplify that equation, since we
know that the maximum speed of the ball is

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:14.000
equal to the (amplitude) times (the square
root of the spring constant) divided by the (mass).

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:19.851
So: the period of the marble’s motion around
the ring is equal to (two pi) times (the root of m) over (k).

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.480
Now, we’ve also talked about the frequency
of uniform circular motion:

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.200
It’s the number of revolutions the marble makes around the ring every second, and it’s equal to 1, divided by the period.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.840
In this case, the frequency will also be equal
to 1 over (2 pi) times (the square root of k) over (m).

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.880
And that’ll apply to the ball on the spring,
too.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.300
Because the rules are the same!

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.760
Finally, there’s angular velocity to consider.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.409
In uniform circular motion, we’ve described
it as the number of radians per second that

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.969
the marble covers as it moves around the ring.

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.529
And angular velocity is just equal to the
frequency times 2 pi.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.080
Which means that in the case of the ball on the spring, it’s equal to the square root of k over m.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.449
So now, with the help of our knowledge about
circular motion, we can understand the period,

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:06.771
frequency, and angular velocity of the ball’s simple harmonic motion as it oscillates on the spring.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.340
But there’s one more question: How does
the ball’s position change over time?

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.600
To find out, we’ll have to analyze the
marble’s motion along the ring again.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.060
And the answer will involve some trigonometry.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.220
But it’s not particularly complicated trig so, it'll be fine.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.120
At any given point along the marble’s path, it’ll be at a certain angle to the right-hand side of the ring.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.960
And the cosine of that angle will be equal to its horizontal distance from the center of the ring, divided by the ring’s radius.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.800
We already know that the radius of the ring is the same as the amplitude of the ball’s motion along the spring.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.910
And if you turn the ring so that it looks
like a line again, you can see that the marble’s

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.659
horizontal distance from the center of the ring is the same as the ball’s distance from the equilibrium point.

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.990
So, the cosine of theta is equal to the (ball’s
position) divided by its (amplitude).

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.050
In other words, the ball’s position is equal
to (the amplitude), times (the cosine of the angle).

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.919
And we can simplify this equation, too.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.800
In the same way that distance is equal to
velocity multiplied by time,

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.620
the angle is equal to the angular velocity multiplied by time.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:06.979
So, we can write the equation for the position
of the ball as x = A cos w t.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:11.499
And when you graph this equation, something interesting happens: It looks like a wave!

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:14.339
We’ll be talking a lot more about waves
in our next three episodes.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.880
But for now, it’s helpful just to see the
connection here:

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.140
For an object in simple harmonic motion, the graph of its position versus time is a wave.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.480
Which is why the swaying of the Millennium
Bridge looked like a wave.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:29.300
Speaking of the bridge: now we can better
understand what happened to it.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.740
The bridge’s shimmy was the result of oscillation, but it was made worse by another culprit: resonance.

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:39.980
Resonance can increase the amplitude of an oscillation by applying force at just the right frequency --

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:45.180
kind of like how you can get a kid to swing higher by pushing at just the right moment.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.590
The engineers of the Millennium Bridge were
reminded of that, the hard way.

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.170
When pedestrians on the bridge started to
lean into its swaying, they created resonance.

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:55.910
They amplified the amplitude of the oscillation.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:08:00.340
And the engineers of the bridge did account for oscillations caused by resonance when they designed it.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.499
But they only considered vertical oscillations -- the kind that would have made the bridge bounce up and down.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.180
They didn’t realize that they’d also have to factor in the horizontal swaying caused by people walking.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:15.979
So, it was only a tiny bit of swaying at first, but it got a lot worse because people were leaning into their steps, causing resonance.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:21.220
In the end, engineers had to apply a series of changes to the bridge that applied force to counteract its oscillations.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:24.800
Because if there’s one thing you don’t
want your bridge to be doing, it’s The Wave.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:29.160
Today, you learned about simple harmonic motion -- the energy of that motion, and how we can use math

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.580
of uniform circular motion to find the period, frequency, and angular velocity of a mass on a spring.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.920
We also described how the position of an object in simple harmonic motion changes over time.
