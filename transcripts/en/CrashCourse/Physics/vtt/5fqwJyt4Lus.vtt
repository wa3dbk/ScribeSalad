00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.980
It was the autumn of 1820.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.180
Hans Christian Oersted had just discovered
the connection between electricity and magnetism.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.400
Meanwhile, a French physicist named André-Marie
Ampère was experimenting with some wires,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.660
trying to learn more about the connection between currents and the magnetic fields they create.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.440
He took two parallel wires, ran a current through both of them in the same direction, and the wires attracted each other!

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.840
And when he ran a current through both wires in the opposite directions, the wires repelled each other!

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:38.220
Studying this strange force between the wires led Ampère to discover one of the most fundamental laws of electromagnetism: what we now call Ampère's Law.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.380
And that's not the only weird thing that current-carrying
wires do.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.180
If you wrap a current-carrying wire into a
coil, the inside of the coil acts like a magnet.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.740
There's a north pole at one end of the coil
and a south pole at the other.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:54.089
And if you put a loop of current-carrying
wire in a magnetic field, it'll turn!

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.729
Ampère's law lets you calculate the strength of the currents and magnetic fields in all these situations.

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:01.729
This also helps explain how motors work.

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:14.220
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.320
So first, those two parallel wires: why do
they attract and repel each other?

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.439
It's easier to see why the two wires act the
way they do if you look at one wire first.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.039
Like we talked about in our last episode, the current running through a wire generates a magnetic field.

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.259
So, let's say you have a long, straight wire
with a current running through it.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.360
The current will create a magnetic field circling
the wire.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.920
That magnetic field decreases the further
you are from the wire.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.420
If you draw a circle that's, say, a centimeter from the wire, the magnetic field along the circle will have a set strength.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.520
Ampère realized that the stronger the current is that's running through the wire, the stronger the magnetic field would be along that circle.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.460
That's the basic logic behind Ampère's Law.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.090
But this is physics, and in physics, we tend
to express relationships in terms of equations.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.880
The equation for Ampère's law applies to any kind of loop – not just a circle – surrounding a current, no matter how many wires there are or how they're arranged or shaped.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.680
The law is valid as long as the current is
constant.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:17.860
The equation itself says that the integral of the magnetic field, B, along the loop, times the cosine of theta, with respect to distance, is equal to a constant – called mu_0 – multiplied by the current running through the loop.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.640
This equation just means that the total magnetic field along the loop is equal to the current running through the loop, times a constant number.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.540
The constant mu_0 is sometimes called the magnetic constant, and it's equal to 4 times pi times 10to the -7th Newtons per Amperes squared.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.740
Now, you may have noticed that there's an integral on the left-hand side of the equation for Ampere's law.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.060
And you might remember that we use integrals when we need to add up lots of infinitely tiny values.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.120
Well, in Ampère's Law, we're adding up all the
little bits of magnetic field along the loop.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.700
We're saying that all those bits of magnetic field added together are equal to the enclosed current, times the magnetic constant.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.580
B is the strength of the magnetic field at
each point along the loop.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.250
Theta is the angle between the magnetic field
and each point on the loop.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.010
And ds is referring to each infinitely tiny
section of the loop.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.070
The mathematics of Ampère's law can get very
complicated very quickly.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.940
But to get a basic sense of how it works, let's return to our scenario: a circle around one long straight wire.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.360
We're trying to find the magnetic field at each point on the circle – that's B – in terms of the enclosed current and the radius of the circle.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.540
So first, let's solve the integral in Ampère's law,
to get the total magnetic field along the circle.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.700
According to the law, we're solving the integral of the magnetic field, times the cosine of theta, with respect to the points along the circle.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.420
But we can simplify this integral pretty easily.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.380
First, you'll notice that the magnetic field coming from our wire is parallel to the circle at every point.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.400
So the angle, theta, is 0, and the cosine
of 0 is 1.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.720
Anything times 1 is equal to itself, so we can just knock the cosine of theta term out of the integral.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.180
Now we're left with the integral of the magnetic field, B, with respect to the points along the circle.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.460
But every part of the circle is the exact
same distance from the wire!

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.300
So the magnetic field will be the same at
every point.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.940
In other words: B is constant, so we can move
it in front of the integral sign.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.680
Now all we need to do is figure out the integral of all the points along the circle, which is equal to the circumference of the circle.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.860
So, 2 times pi times the radius.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:21.120
Putting that all together, we find that when we apply Ampère's law to a long straight wire, the total magnetic field along a circle surrounding a wire is equal to B times 2 times pi times the radius.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.800
And that total magnetic field is equal to
the magnetic constant times the enclosed current.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.420
So! For a long straight wire, B is equal to the magnetic constant times the enclosed current, divided by 2 pi r.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:39.660
The equation for the magnetic field along a circle surrounding one wire turned out to be really important for Ampère when he was trying to figure out what was going on with two wires.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.300
When both wires had current running through them in the same direction, they attracted each other.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.780
And when the current was going in opposite
directions, they repelled each other.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.930
It's easy to see why, if you apply the first
right-hand rule.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:58.760
That's the one that says if you point your right thumb in the direction of a current and curl your fingers, the magnetic field points in the same direction as your fingers.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.240
So first, let's look at the wires with currents
running in the same direction.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.380
For this example, we'll say that they're vertical
wires, with the current flowing upward.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.920
If you point your right thumb in the direction of the current in each wire, your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.540
The magnetic field from the wire on the left
will be pointing to the right.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.620
And the magnetic field from the wire on the right will be pointing to the left, so the wires will attract each other.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.580
For the case where the current is flowing in opposite directions, the reverse is true, so they'll repel each other.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.520
Now, Ampere also wanted to find the force
from the magnetic field on the wires.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:38.120
Like we talked about last time, the force depends on the angle between the current and the magnetic field, the strength of the current, the length of the wire, and the strength of the magnetic field.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.800
Calculating that magnetic field, B, was the
tricky part.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:51.800
But the equation he came up with, the one that we now call Ampere's Law, allowed him – and future physicists! – to figure out what B was in a lot of situations, including the case of the two parallel wires.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.580
So the two parallel wires attracted and repelled each other because of the magnetic field created by the current.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.880
What about the coil of wire that turned into
a magnet?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.700
Well, you can probably guess that its behavior also has to do with the magnetic field produced by a current.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.860
See, that coil of wire is a special shape
called a solenoid.

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:14.380
And when a solenoid has a current running through it, it produces a magnetic field, basically all of which goes through the inside of the coils.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:23.060
If you curl your right hand around the solenoid so that your fingers point in the direction of the current running through the loops, your thumb will point in the direction of the magnetic field.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:34.360
Ampère's law is useful for solenoids, too: it says that the magnetic field inside the coils, B, is equal to the magnetic constant, times the current running through the coils, times the number of coils.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.650
So that's what happens when loops of wire
create a magnetic field.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.060
When you stick a loop of wire in a magnetic
field, something a little stranger happens:
the loop of wire turns.

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.740
That's because the magnetic field creates
a torque on the wire.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.680
Take a look at this loop of wire.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.420
The horizontal parts of the loop are parallel to the magnetic field, so it won't exert a force on them.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:00.280
But the vertical parts of the loop are perpendicular to the magnetic field, so it will exert a force on them – a force that turns the loop.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:09.300
From the last episode, we know that the force from the magnetic field on the wire will be equal to the current, times the length of that part of the coil, times the magnetic field.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.900
And we can use the second right-hand rule
to figure out the direction of that force.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:20.960
If you point your hand in the direction of the current, then bend your fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, your thumb will point in the direction of the force.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:26.120
Which turns out to be away from you for the left-hand side of the coil, and toward you for the right-hand side.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.970
So the coil turns clockwise.

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:34.400
This is how electric motors work: they have an electric current that continuously flips directions, making loops of wire spin.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:42.880
Those moving loops of wire can be used to do mechanical work, like turning the drum in your washing machine, or your power drill, or the fan that probably cools your computer.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.060
There are electric motors all over the place.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:54.380
So the next time you wash your clothes, or put together some furniture, or use your computer without it overheating, or do anything else that involves an electric motor, you have Ampère to thank.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.860
Today, you learned about Ampère's law, and
how it applies to a long straight wire.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:03.260
We also talked about the forces between two parallel wires, and the magnetic field created by a solenoid.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.760
Finally, we described the torque on a current
loop.
