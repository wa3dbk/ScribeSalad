00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.040
Hi, I’m Dr. Shini Somara and I hear you
want to learn physics.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.789
I have to say: good choice.

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.260
Physics is the science of how the world -- really
the whole universe -- works.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.699
And I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but
in the world I live in, things tend to move around a lot.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.199
So that’s what we’re going to study first:
the science of motion.

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.730
And it turns out to be incredibly useful -- for
figuring out things like where you are, or

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.670
where you’ve been, or how you’re moving
through the world.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:29.960
Why is that worth knowing?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.780
Well, for one thing: The police use physics
to decide how exactly how fast you’re moving

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.690
through the world, and if that motion happens
to break the law.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.010
So if you’re gonna understand how and why
you got that ticket they gave you -- and maybe

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.070
even know enough to dispute it -- you have
to know the science of motion, too.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.570
And in order to do that, you’ll need to
understand a few essential conditions that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.790
describe your physical place in the universe.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.640
Conditions like time, position, velocity,
and acceleration.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.680
So to talk about all of these things at the same time,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.760
you’ll need a set of equations that links all of them together.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.740
These are called the kinematic equations.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.970
So, for the next few minutes, let’s talk
about how you can figure out your place in

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.490
the world -- literally -- which just might
help you beat that speeding ticket.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:24.910
[Theme Music]

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.080
Let’s say you’re driving on a straight stretch
of highway. Say, someplace nice and flat,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.360
on the wide open spaces of the Northern
Plains of the United States. Say…North Dakota.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.890
You come across a red light, and even
though there are no cars in sight, you stop.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.720
Because you’re a good driver who obeys traffic laws.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.810
Then, the light turns green, so you hit the
gas. Annnnd exactly seven seconds later,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.980
you hear the sirens and see the flashing lights
of a police car.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.670
You’re promptly served with a ticket for
speeding in a 100 kilometer an hour zone.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.590
But wait. Were you really going that fast?
Did you actually break the law?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.580
You can’t really tell, because the
speedometer in your car is broken.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.300
So you need to find another way to figure
out how fast you were going, and decide if

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.780
you want to take this up this issue with Johnny
Law in court.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.520
That’s where physics comes in -- the physics
of moving in a straight line.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.540
Let’s start by talking about how your car
was moving.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.610
Driving along a straight highway is an example
of one-dimensional motion because the car

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.320
can only move back and forth along that line.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.760
That’s different from something that’s
free to move in all three dimensions,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.700
like a boomerang flying through the air.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.580
And instead of describing that motion just
in terms of speed, or direction, like a police

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.350
officer or other non-physicist might do, we
physicists describe it with math.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.110
Maths that measures the four main
conditions of the car’s movement --

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.670
its time, position, velocity, and acceleration.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.780
Time simply tells you how long you were driving
for. Position is also important: It lets you

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.460
know where you are or where you were. It can
even be negative.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.320
For one-dimensional motion, there are only
two directions you can move in --

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.640
in this case, forward or backward, east or west.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.330
So, if the change in position -- known as
displacement -- is positive, you’ll know

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.280
you’ve moved in one of those directions.
If it’s negative, you’re traveling the other way.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
But which direction is positive, and which
is negative? That’s totally arbitrary.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.800
You could decide that east should be positive
and west negative, or the other way around

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.300
-- but the answers you get will mean the same
thing.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.200
You just have to make sure to keep track of
which direction is positive, and keep that

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.620
in mind when you’re talking about velocity
and acceleration, too.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.400
Velocity is the way your position changes
over time, and it’s also a pretty big deal.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.750
It’s kind of like speed, but just like with
displacement, it also tells you which direction

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.620
you’re moving in, based on whether it’s
positive or negative.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.150
Now, what about when your velocity changes?

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.730
That’s the fourth quality of movement you’ll
want to pay attention to: acceleration.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.490
If you’ve ever been in a car when someone
slammed on the gas, that feeling of being

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.980
pressed back against your seat is acceleration
-- your velocity’s changing.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.920
So, how do we plot out all of these different
conditions that describe the movement of you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.319
and your vehicle through the plains of North
Dakota?

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.670
A non-physicist might visualize this movement
on something like a map, but for us, graphs

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.260
are the most useful way to show how all this
change in position is happening.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.770
Graphs are generally presented as position
versus time -- with position on the vertical

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:18.380
axis, and time on the horizontal axis.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.400
We’ll label your position as x and time
as t.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:27.360
Now, let’s imagine three different scenarios for how you drove through this small town, and graph each one.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.860
First, let’s say that, after you went through
the red light, you just stayed in one spot

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.360
-- say, at 4 meters from the light -- for
three seconds.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.919
From that moment, the graph of your position
would just be a flat line at x = 4 m, like this.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.419
Now, what if you didn’t stop, but instead
were coasting at one meter per second?

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.120
Then the line would be diagonal, to show how
your position was changing -- like this.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.440
And the third time, let’s say you were standing still at first at the 4 meter mark, but then you hit the gas,

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.940
and you moved in such a way that,
after 1 second, you went 1 meter in the positive

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.030
direction and after 2 seconds you went 4 meters
and after 3 seconds you’ve gone 9 meters.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.570
In that case, you end up with a graph that’s
all curvy, like this.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.530
But there’s more going on in these
scenarios than just your position and time.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.400
You also have to be able to graph your
velocity and acceleration.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.100
So, to graph your velocity, you’d put your velocity on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.180
And you’ll note that, since velocity is
measured as the change in position over time,

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.280
it’s measured in meters per second.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.920
The graph for acceleration is quite similar -- acceleration, a, goes on the vertical, and time goes on the horizontal.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.760
And since acceleration is measured as the
change in meters per second, its units are

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.660
meters per second per second -- otherwise
known as meters per second, squared.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.240
So: time, position, velocity, and
acceleration all relate to each other.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.520
Velocity is the change in position over time, and acceleration is the change in velocity over time.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.460
And often, your velocity will be different
from moment to moment -- like the third time

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.669
you drove down the highway, when you hit the
gas.

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.960
But let’s say you wanted to know your average velocity for a certain period -- say, for those first three seconds.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.400
All you have to do is take the change in position
and divide it by the change in time.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.400
Figuring out how much something is changing just means that you have to subtract its starting value from its final value.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:22.180
And since, as physicists, we’ll end up doing
that a lot, we abbreviate that difference

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.970
using the lowercase Greek letter delta.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:31.140
So we can use that to write the equation for average velocity: It’s just delta x over delta t.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.139
The change in position over the change
in time.

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.240
Now what about the third scenario? When you
had your foot on the gas and kept accelerating?

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.210
You started out at the 4 meter mark, and ended
up at the 13 meter mark. So your change in

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.400
position, or delta-x, would be 13 minus 4,
or 9 meters.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.300
And you started at 0 seconds and ended at
3 seconds, meaning that your delta-t was 3 seconds.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.139
Over 3 seconds, you moved 9 meters. That’s
3 meters per second!

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:04.179
The equation we use to describe average acceleration
is a lot like the one for average velocity,

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.720
because it’s just the change in velocity
divided by the change in time.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.500
So, in that case, your equation would be delta
v over delta t.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.030
And! Here’s something that is incredibly
handy.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.860
Since we’re talking about constant acceleration
— that is, acceleration that takes place

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:25.320
at a constant rate — we can rearrange this
equation to get v = v_0 + at.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:32.200
That's average velocity equaling to velocity at time 0 plus the product of acceleration times time.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.540
This, my fellow physicists, is an equation
we’ll be using a lot.

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:39.250
We call it the definition of acceleration
-- because that’s exactly what it is.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:44.300
It’s saying that constant acceleration is equal to the change in velocity divided by the change in time --

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.140
we just used algebra to move the
variables around.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.020
Now, it’s worth noting that there are lots
of different kinds of acceleration,

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.380
ones that don’t involve speeding tickets --
like when something is falling.

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:59.360
The force of gravity pulling it down is making
it accelerate at 9.81 meters per second squared,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.570
which physicists often abbreviate as a lowercase
g.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:07.259
So we’ll just call that constant small g
… there’s a capital G that’s going to come up later.

00:08:07.259 --> 00:08:11.910
So, the definition of acceleration is the
first of the two main kinematic equations

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:17.340
that we’ll be using. But it only links velocity,
acceleration, and time. What about position?

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.410
There’s an equation for that too -- the
second kinematic equation, which we’ll call

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:25.949
the displacement curve, because it takes your
acceleration, your starting velocity, and

00:08:25.949 --> 00:08:30.940
how long you were moving for, and uses that
information to figure out what your  displacement was.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.540
And the displacement curve equation looks
like this.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:38.110
It makes sense, if you think about it -- if
your acceleration is the change in your velocity,

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:43.219
and your velocity is the change in your position, then there should be some way to link all of them together.

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:46.559
Now, there are lots of other kinematic equations,
too, like these.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:50.290
But, you only really need to know the first
two -- the definition of acceleration and

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.019
the displacement curve. The others are just
different ways of rearranging these main two.

00:08:55.019 --> 00:09:00.299
And because these two equations have so many terms in common, you can use them together really easily.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.800
For example, if you know your acceleration,
and your starting and final velocities,

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.340
you could use the definition of acceleration to
figure out how much time you were traveling for.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.600
Then you could plug that value for time into the displacement curve equation and use it to find your displacement.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:18.749
Now that we know what the kinematic equations
are, we can finally use the power of physics

00:09:18.749 --> 00:09:21.779
to find out whether you were speeding when
the cops pulled you over.

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:25.980
As with most physics problems, the first thing
we need to do is write down everything we know.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:30.639
In this case, we know your initial velocity,
v-nought, was 0, and your time, t, was 7 seconds.

00:09:30.639 --> 00:09:36.139
The first thing we need to find is your acceleration,
which we can get using the displacement curve.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.620
Plugging in everything we know, we find that
your acceleration, a, was 5 meters per second squared.

00:09:41.629 --> 00:09:47.480
Then, we can plug all of that into the definition of
acceleration, to find your final velocity, like this:

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:51.760
We learn that you were going 35 meters per
second when the cops pulled you over.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.640
That’s 126 kilometers an hour…
So you definitely deserve that ticket. Sorry.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:03.220
But, in this very first episode of Crash Course Physics, you learned all about position, velocity, and acceleration.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.640
We also talked about the two main
kinematic equations:

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.660
the definition of acceleration,
and the displacement curve.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:14.880
