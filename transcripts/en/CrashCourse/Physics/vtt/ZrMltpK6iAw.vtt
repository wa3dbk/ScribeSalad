00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.480
You've probably seen it on TV a bunch of times.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.380
A person collapses in a hospital, and a doctor rushes over with a couple of paddles, puts them on the patient’s chest and then shouts "Clear!"

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.540
After a jolt, the patient is saved.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.240
That life-saving technology is real.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.200
And it works because of two main electrical principles: electric potential energy and capacitance.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.240
Those paddles are parts of a defibrillator,
which is basically just a really big capacitor.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.370
It uses electric charge to store energy, which
is then discharged into the patient’s body.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.860
The current stops the irregular contractions of the cardiac muscle, and gives the heart a chance to start beating normally.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.540
Get ready, because this lesson has the potential
to save lives!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:52.420
[Theme Music]

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.640
To understand how a capacitor can save someone’s life, let’s review what capacitors are, and how they work.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.880
A capacitor consists of two parallel conductive plates of opposite charge, with an electric field between them.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.200
This set-up allows a capacitor to store energy
as electric potential energy.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.380
In the same way that an object has ‘gravitational’ potential energy when you hold it above the ground,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.060
a charged object can have ‘electric’ potential energy when it’s held in an electric field.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.580
And in either case, potential energy can be used to perform work – when a force is applied over a distance.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.760
But how can you determine how much electric potential energy a system has, and how much work it can do?

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.840
Like, in the case of a defibrillator, you just want enough potential energy to stop an irregular heartbeat, but not so much that it causes harm.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.160
To measure potential energy in an electric field, let’s imagine a positive test charge that’s moving between a capacitor’s plates.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:47.619
When we place the positive charge between the plates, the uniform electric field generates a constant force on it, in the direction of the negative plate.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:57.320
If the test charge starts on the positive plate and travels in the direction of the electric force, we can calculate the work done on it, by multiplying the electric force by the distance between the plates.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.940
We also know that this force is equal to the
value of the test charge times the electric field.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:10.320
We can apply an equal and opposite force to the charged particle and move it across the capacitor as slowly as we like, so that the kinetic energy of the particle is negligible.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.239
And because of what we know about the work-energy theorem and the law of conservation of energy,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.300
we know that a change of potential energy is equal to the work done by the external force, or the negative work done by the electric force.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.580
So, we’ve found the potential energy decrease of a single point charge in a uniform electric field.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:36.800
And this drop in potential energy, divided by the test charge's magnitude, gives us the electric potential energy difference per unit charge, also known as the electric potential.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.240
The electric potential depends on the electric field and the position, but it does not depend on the charge of the test charge.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.209
Now, the units of electric potential are Joules
over Coulombs, more commonly known as Volts.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.420
And the electric potential difference is also called voltage, which is another way of describing a drop in electric potential.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.180
When we express it mathematically, voltage is equal to the negative electric field times the distance between the capacitor plates.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.440
OK, we’ve used our hypothetical positive test charge to describe how much voltage is present across the charged capacitor.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.640
Now let’s put our new expressions to the test and find the electric potential difference in a real scenario.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:21.239
Let’s say we have a capacitor with plates one millimeter apart and an electric field of 1000 Newtons per Coulomb – which is the same as 1000 Volts per meter.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:29.980
The electric field can be found by dividing force by charge, or, for that matter, Newtons over Coulombs, as well as Voltage over distance, or Volts per meter.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.540
They all represent the same value.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.480
So, say we multiply 1000 volts per meter by
1mm.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.400
We find that the capacitor has a voltage of one volt.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.680
Now, since a capacitor creates a uniform electric field, we can assume the electric force is constant, and that it acts in the direction in which the test charge moves.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.680
And as it moves, the potential will decrease
more and more.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.180
We can represent this voltage drop visually, by drawing lines along the locations where all the test charges have the same voltage.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.440
These are known as equipotential lines.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:06.560
In a capacitor, these lines run parallel to the plates, and each line that’s closer to the negative plate has a lower electric potential, or a lower voltage.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.420
And these equipotential lines are always perpendicular
to the electric field.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.500
So far, we’ve learned how to calculate electric potential for capacitors – but can we apply the same ideas to point charges?

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.670
Well, we know the equation for the electric
field generated by a point charge.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.540
But since there’s no uniform field, like there would be with a capacitor, we can’t use all of the equations that we’ve been using so far.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:35.139
Finding the electric potential created by a point charge is like finding the difference in potential energy per unit charge, between the spot right next to the point charge and somewhere infinitely far away.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:45.000
If a small charged object with the same sign was next to our point charge Q, it would start with a high electric potential while it was close by, and have a very low electric potential as it got farther away.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.400
So we can calculate the total electric potential possible, by integrating the negative electric field from to infinity to zero.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.460
We’re left with an equation that describes the electric potential generated by any point charge.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.039
And we can map equipotential lines for point
charges in the same way we did for the capacitor.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.660
For a point charge, the equipotential lines look like circles of increasing size around the charged particle.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.280
The farther away from the point charge, the
lower the voltage.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.880
And for an electric dipole – which is one positive point charge and one negative point charge – the electric potentials from individual charges can be added together.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.040
Here, you’ll see that each equipotential line is not a constant distance from a point charge.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:24.420
That’s because you’ve got two point charges
with their own electric fields.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:31.380
So a test charge on the right side of the positive point charge won’t have the same potential as one the same distance away on the opposite side.

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.920
Now let’s go back to potential energy in
capacitors.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.820
Because it’s largely why capacitors are so incredibly useful – from defibrillators to electronic components:

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.760
When a capacitor’s plates store electric
charge, they’re actually storing energy!

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.080
If you connect a battery to a basic circuit that contains only a capacitor, the battery causes charge to move from one plate to the other, through the conductive wire.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.399
This results in one positively charged plate
and one negatively charged plate.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:01.319
But the capacitor hasn’t gained any net charge – there’s just as much positive charge on the positive plate as there is negative charge on the negative one.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:10.760
So, the battery uses its own electric potential to generate a current that transfers voltage in the battery to voltage in the capacitor, giving the capacitor a certain amount of potential energy.

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.360
For our defibrillator, this energy is quickly turned from potential energy into a jolt of electricity through the human body.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.779
Now if you’re trying to save a life, you want to make sure you’re getting just the right amount of energy out of the capacitor.

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:29.880
So to measure how much charge a capacitor can store, we can use a battery in our circuit to create a voltage between the plates, and then divide the charge in each plate by that voltage.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.540
This value is known as capacitance – how
much charge a capacitor is able to hold.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:39.380
Capacitance uses units of Farads, with one
Farad equal to one Coulomb per Volt.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.460
Typically, capacitance values are very small, so we often talk about capacitors in terms of microFarads or nanoFarads.

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:50.169
And capacitance is actually determined by
the size and shape of a capacitor.

00:06:50.169 --> 00:07:00.829
One way to express capacitance is to divide the area of each plate by the distance between them, and multiply that by a constant – known as the permittivity of free space – denoted by epsilon naught.

00:07:00.829 --> 00:07:06.520
Make the plates larger, or move them closer together, then there’s room to fit more charge, creating a stronger electric field.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.620
And once you’ve established the geometry
of the plates, the capacitance does not change

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.369
– unless you stick something between them,
which actually increases the capacitance.

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:19.349
And this something is called a dielectric – typically an insulating material like plastic or glass.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:24.169
A dielectric is used to increase capacitance while preventing any charge from jumping from plate to plate.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:32.000
Sometimes, as the plates get hotter or the voltage gets higher, some electrons naturally jump between the plates, decreasing the amount of stored charge.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.979
So an insulator prevents electrons from crossing
the gap.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.880
And you usually want the plates to be as close together as possible without touching, since a smaller distance equals a larger capacitance.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.900
So, by using a very thin dielectric, the distance
is decreased while the plates remain separate.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:53.700
And the molecules that make up dielectrics are polar, which means one side of the molecule is slightly positive while the other side is slightly negative.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:08:03.820
The molecules align themselves with the electric field and generate their own field in the opposite direction, resulting in an overall weaker electric field, while the plates retain the same amount of charge.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:13.200
So by inserting an insulating material into our capacitor, we’ve increased capacitance and can hold more charge, and thus energy, for the same amount of voltage.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.119
And that’s why the full equation for capacitance
includes a dielectric constant, K.

00:08:17.119 --> 00:08:20.419
So dielectrics can help capacitors hold even
more energy.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.780
And that potential energy is actually stored within the electric field between a capacitor’s charged plates.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:34.380
We can calculate the potential energy stored in this field by integrating the voltage over the charge in the plates, which reduces down to one half charge time voltage.

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.259
But when using a capacitor, it’s useful to know how much energy is stored in an electric field per unit volume.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:50.120
We often want to know how much energy is in a certain location, like between capacitor plates, so we use energy density, or the amount of energy stored in the electric field per unit volume.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:58.900
And we can calculate the energy density associated with an electric field – at any point in space – by dividing the potential energy by the volume between the plates.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.620
With some algebra, we find that this boils down to one half epsilon naught times the electric field squared.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.820
And this relation holds true for any space
with an electric field.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:16.600
Now that we know all this, a medic can make sure those defibrillator paddles have the right capacitance, have been given enough charge to create a high voltage, and then CLEAR!

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.720
Physics to the rescue.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.040
Today we learned a lot!

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.340
We talked about electric potential energy and how it differs from electric potential, or voltage.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.560
We discussed how capacitors function and the factors that determine how much charge they hold.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:34.020
We also learned how to maximize energy storage and how to calculate the potential energy held by any capacitor.
