[flute plays Crash Course theme]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.420
That’s a familiar tune!

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.940
How do instruments, like this guitar, create
music?

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.260
We’ve talked about the science of sound,
and some of the properties of sound waves.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.720
But when we talk about sound waves in the context of music, there are all kinds of fascinating properties and weird rules to talk about.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.100
I’m talking about the music that comes from
string, wind, and brass instruments.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.480
String instruments create sound when their
strings vibrate in the air.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.220
And in order to understand how these instruments work, you have to realize that making music is not just an art.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.370
It’s ALSO a science.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:53.280
[Theme Music]

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.520
Sound, you’ll recall, is a wave: a ‘longitudinal’
wave.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.660
This means that the medium that the wave travels
through oscillates -- or moves back and forth

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.999
-- in the same direction that the wave is
moving.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.860
But string, wind, and brass instruments use
a special kind of wave — they’re ‘standing waves.'

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.580
A standing wave is a wave that looks like
it isn't moving.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.140
Its ‘amplitude’ may change, but it isn't
traveling anywhere.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.460
Standing waves are the result of two other things waves do, both of which we’ve talked about before:
reflection and interference.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.340
Reflection is what happens when a wave reaches the end of a path, and then moves back along the same path.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.600
That’s what happens when you send a pulse down a rope -- it reaches the end, and then comes right back.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.570
When we send a continuous wave down the rope,
that’s when interference comes into play.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.840
The wave reaches the end of the rope and is
reflected, but there are more peaks on the way.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.040
As the peaks pass each other, they interfere
with one another, changing their sizes.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.300
Usually, you end up with crests and troughs
that are different sizes and various distances apart.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.180
But at certain frequencies, the reflected waves interfere in such a way that you end up

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.360
with a wave that seems to stay perfectly
still, with only its amplitude changing.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.060
That’s a standing wave, and it can happen
both in strings and in the air in pipes.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.760
And that's what makes music: Standing waves with different frequencies correspond to different musical notes.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.040
Now, in order to understand how standing
waves operate, you should get to know their anatomy.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.420
The points of a standing wave that don’t
oscillate are called nodes,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.320
and the points at the maximum height of the peaks are antinodes.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.709
And here’s something cool.

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:24.060
If you look at a string on a stringed instrument, you can actually see where the nodes and antinodes are.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.060
The standing wave creates peaks along the string, and between those peaks, there are points that just stay still.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.840
So the peaks are the antinodes, and the points
that don’t oscillate are nodes.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.120
And if one or both of the string’s ends are fixed, then each fixed end is a node too, because it’s stuck in place.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.240
Now, in a pipe, the standing waves are made
of air molecules moving back and forth.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.820
But the areas where molecules oscillate the most

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.180
(including those near any open ends of the pipe) form the peaks, and therefore the antinodes.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.780
And between those peaks, as well as at any closed ends of the pipe, are areas where molecules don’t move at all; those are the nodes.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.010
Generally, musicians make their music using
the frequencies of these standing waves.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.120
But the nature of these waves depends a lot
on what the ends of the string or pipe look like.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.840
Remember how a wave traveling down a rope gets reflected differently, depending on whether the end of the rope is fixed or loose?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.129
A fixed end will invert the wave -- turning
crests into troughs, and vice versa --

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.913
while a loose end will just reflect it without inverting it.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.480
The same thing holds true for air in a pipe: a closed end will invert the wave, while an open end won’t.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.260
So the properties of a standing wave will
be a little different,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.860
depending on whether it’s made with a string with two fixed ends, or a pipe with two ends open,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.120
or a string or a pipe with one end fixed,
and the other open.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.580
A string with two fixed ends -- like in a piano -- is probably the simplest way to understand standing waves.

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.400
Because, we know that no matter what, the wave made by a fixed string will have at least two nodes -- one at each end.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.660
And in its most basic form, it would have
just one antinode, in the middle.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.880
So the wave is basically a peak that moves
from being a crest to a trough and vice versa

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.060
like some kind of one-dimensional jump rope.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.420
This most basic kind of standing wave is known
as the fundamental -- or the 1st harmonic.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.820
It’s the simplest possible standing wave
you can have, with the fewest nodes and antinodes.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.720
There are other, more complex standing waves
that you can have, too.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.500
These are known as overtones.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.860
Overtones build on the fundamental, incrementally:
each overtone adds a node and an antinode.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.700
So each of these overtones is related to the fundamental wave -- and all of the overtones are related to each other.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.160
Together, the fundamental wave and the overtones
make up what are known as harmonics.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.960
The fundamental is the 1st harmonic, and the
overtones are higher-numbered harmonics.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.240
With each node-and-antinode pair that’s
added to the standing wave,

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.380
the number of the harmonic goes up:
2nd harmonic, 3rd harmonic, and so on.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.780
Now, physicists sometimes express harmonics
in terms of wavelength.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.480
For example, for a string with two fixed ends, you’ll notice that the fundamental covers exactly half a wavelength.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.660
A full wavelength of the wave would
span two peaks: a crest and a trough,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.260
but the fundamental spans exactly one peak,
which is half the wavelength.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.060
So, for the fundamental of a string with two fixed ends, the length of the string is equal to half a wavelength.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.580
The second-simplest standing wave you can have on a string with two fixed ends has 3 nodes --

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.940
one at each end, and one in the middle
-- plus 2 antinodes in between the nodes.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.660
It’s called the 2nd harmonic, and the string
holds exactly one wavelength.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.600
You can probably guess what the 3rd harmonic
looks like: it has 4 nodes and 3 antinodes,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.260
and the string holds 1.5 -- or, 3/2 -- wavelengths.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.840
You may have started to notice a pattern:
For a standing wave on a given length of string,

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.440
the number of wavelengths that fit on the string is equal to the number of the harmonic, divided by 2.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.320
So, now we have an equation that relates the wavelength of a standing wave to the number of the harmonic and the length of the string.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.280
Once you get a handle on wavelength, you can figure out the aspect of the wave that musicians care about most -- the frequency.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.900
We’ve already established that a wave’s wavelength, times its frequency, is equal to its velocity,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.080
which will be the same for each harmonic, because a wave’s velocity only depends on the medium it’s traveling through.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.200
So a standing wave’s frequency will be equal
to its velocity divided by its wavelength.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.700
For the fundamental with two fixed ends, we already know that the wavelength is twice the string's length.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.640
So the frequency of that fundamental standing
wave -- known as the fundamental frequency

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.000
-- is equal to the velocity, divided by
twice the length of the string.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We write it as f, with a subscript of 1.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.940
Now what about the frequency of the second harmonic -- the standing wave with 3 nodes and 2 antinodes?

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.240
It will be equal to the velocity, divided
by the length of the string.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.300
Which is twice the fundamental frequency.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.060
And the frequency of the third harmonic,
with its 4 nodes and 3 antinodes,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.640
will be equal to three times
the fundamental frequency.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.960
So, we’re starting to see another pattern here:

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.620
The frequency of a standing wave with two fixed ends will just be equal to the number of the harmonic, times the fundamental frequency.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.180
In fact, that’s one way to define harmonics:

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:42.620
The number of a harmonic is equal to the number you multiply by the fundamental frequency, to get the harmonic’s frequency.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.320
This math is what makes musical instruments
work.

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.060
When you press down a key on a piano, you make a hammer strike a string, creating standing waves in that string.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.460
Every string in the piano is tuned so that
its fundamental frequency --

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.120
which depends on the string’s mass, length, and tension -- corresponds to a given note.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.620
Middle C, for example, is 261.6 Hz.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.000
Guitars are also tuned so that the fundamental frequencies of their strings, correspond to set notes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.680
And when you press down on the strings
in certain places,

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:15.720
you change the length of the active part of string so that its fundamental frequency corresponds to a different note.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:20.980
So, for a standing wave with two fixed ends,
we can relate wavelength, frequency, velocity,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.860
the length of the string, and the number of
the harmonic.

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:30.140
And we can do the exact same thing for a standing wave with two loose ends -- in an open pipe, for example, like in a flute.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.060
A standing wave in a pipe with two open ends is kind of the opposite, of the wave with two fixed ends:

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.380
Instead of having a node at each end, it has
an antinode at each end.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.830
So the fundamental standing wave for a pipe
with two open ends will have two antinodes,

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.570
and one node in the middle of the wave.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.150
Then, the 2nd harmonic will have three antinodes
and two nodes, and so on.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.720
But each harmonic still covers the same number
of wavelengths.

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.930
Remember how the fundamental wave for a string
with two fixed ends covered half of a wavelength?

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.400
The fundamental wave for a pipe with two open
ends also covers half of a wavelength.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.800
That half is just in a different section of
the wave.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:09.280
And just like a string with two fixed ends, the second harmonic for a pipe with two open ends also covers a full wavelength.

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.900
It’s just that, in the case of the pipe, the wave starts and ends with a peak instead of a node.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.500
So the equations for wavelength and frequency
for a standing wave with two open ends

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.620
will be the same as they were for a standing wave with two fixed ends.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:23.120
So, we’ve covered guitars and pianos and flutes!

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.820
But a pipe with one closed end and one open
end works a little differently.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:32.620
These kinds of pipes are used in instruments like pan flutes, where you blow across the top of a closed pipe to make music.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.950
Here, standing waves need a separate set of
equations, for a couple of reasons:

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:40.290
First, the closed end of the pipe will be a node, because the air molecules aren’t oscillating there.

00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:44.040
And the open end will be an antinode, because
that’s where there’s a peak in the oscillations.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.590
Which means that the simplest wave you can make in this pipe will stretch from one node, to one peak.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.350
But that’s only a span of a quarter of a
wavelength in the pipe.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:57.310
Before, with both a string fixed at both ends, and an open pipe, the fundamental spanned half a wavelength.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.370
The fact that a pan-flute pipe only covers
a quarter of a wavelength changes things.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:07.060
Because, remember: the frequency of each harmonic is equal to the number of the harmonic, times the fundamental frequency.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.940
But for a pipe that’s closed on one end,
you can’t double the fundamental frequency,

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.460
or quadruple it -- or multiply it by any even
number.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:18.780
Because it would result in a wave that would
need a node on both ends, or a peak on both ends.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:19.940
Which isn't possible.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.300
So, a pipe that’s closed on one end can’t
have even-numbered harmonics.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.000
All of this helps explain why musical instruments sound different, even when they’re playing the same note.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.580
When you play a note, you’re creating the fundamental wave, plus some of the other harmonics -- the overtones.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.340
And for each instrument, different harmonics will have different amplitudes -- and therefore sound louder.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.580
But because of the physics of standing waves, instruments that have pipes with one closed end

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.100
won't create the even-numbered harmonics
at all.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.940
That’s why a C on the flute sounds so different
from a C on, say, the bassoon!

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.060
Today, you learned about standing waves, and
how they’re made up of nodes and antinodes.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.440
We discussed harmonics, and how to find the
frequency of a standing wave on a string with

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.500
two fixed ends, a pipe with two open ends,
and a pipe with one closed end.

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:04.540
Finally, we explained why a pipe with one
closed end can’t have even-numbered harmonics.
