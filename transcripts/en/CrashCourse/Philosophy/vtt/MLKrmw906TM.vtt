00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.280
A film for your philosophical consideration:
The Matrix.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.900
You gotta remember the, uh, the humans floating
in vats of KY jelly?

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.820
Tubes and wires keeping them alive, stimulating
their brains, to make them believe that they

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.660
were experiencing the real world – the world
we all think we know?

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.700
Well, almost-20-year-old spoiler alert here: some of
them come to find out that the real world was a

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.220
desolate wasteland, and the lives everyone thought they were living were just fabrications fed into their brains.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.920
A select few were ‘rescued’ from the illusion,
but some of them were so unhappy in the real

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.399
world that they chose to return to illusion.

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.159
But Neo -- and the others who chose to stay
and fight --- were the philosophical heroes

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.599
of the movie, choosing truth at the cost of
comfort and happiness.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.380
After watching The Matrix, you might’ve
found yourself wondering: Could this be true?

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:55.940
Could we possibly be stuck in a dream world
of someone else’s making, with no way to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.489
tell that our “reality” isn’t real at
all?

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.499
If so, you’re not the first person to have
wondered about these things.

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.779
In fact, the original Neo? The guy who really
went into battle against the matrix of illusion,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.359
in order to defend the Truth?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.540
He was a 17th century mathematician. Named
Rene.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:20.660
[Theme Music]

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.000
Last time, we talked about Plato, and his
belief that the ordinary reality of the material

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.659
world is only a shadowy approximation of Ultimate
Reality.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.279
Socrates, meanwhile, who was widely believed to be the wisest man in Athens, fretted about how little he knew.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.620
Philosophers spend a lot of time obsessing
about knowledge, wishing they knew more, and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.200
worrying that they’re wrong about what they
think they know.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.929
They even, if you remember from the first
episode, have a fancy name for the study of

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.560
knowledge – epistemology.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.670
The philosopher who gets the gold star for
taking this how-do-I-know-what-I-know paranoia

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.840
to astonishing levels is the early modern philosopher, scientist, and mathematician, Rene Descartes.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.479
When you watch The Matrix, you should congratulate the Wachowskis for giving us such a great sci-fi adventure story.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.789
But you should also remember that the archetype
of the story actually has its roots all the

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.820
way back in the writings of Descartes, in
the early 1600s.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.620
For a story like The Matrix to get off the
ground, the audience has to be willing to

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.560
entertain some level of skepticism.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.240
And a skeptic is someone who questions whether
it’s possible to know anything with certainty.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.300
And Descartes was the mac daddy of all skeptics.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.540
He was so skeptical, named a form of skepticism
after him – Cartesian Skepticism!

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.340
Why was Descartes so skeptical?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.040
Well, he realized that many of the beliefs
he used to hold were actually false. We all

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.170
go through this; it’s part of what we call
growing up.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.870
Learning the horrible truth about Santa and
the tooth fairy. That you can’t actually

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.940
buy everything you want and need for just $100.
That your parents don't really have all the answers.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.040
But realizing that he used to believe things
that were false really got Descartes to thinking.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.080
Because: When he believed those things, he
didn’t realize they were false.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.760
So what if some of the things he still believed were also false, and he just hadn’t realized it yet?

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.140
How could he know that his beliefs were true?

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.849
Well, after a bit of a freak out, Descartes
realized that the only way to make sure he

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.269
wasn’t holding any false beliefs was to
disbelieve everything. At least temporarily.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.959
He offered this as an analogy: Imagine you
have a basket of apples, and you’re concerned

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.689
that some of the apples might be rotten.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.250
Since the rot could spread and ruin the fresh
apples, the only way to make sure there’s

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.159
no rot in the basket is to dump out all the
fruit, inspect each apple in turn, and return

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.120
only the fresh apples to the basket.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.920
Knowing that, just like rotten fruit, a rotten idea
can spread and infect all the ideas around it,

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.800
Descartes up-ended the apple basket of
his beliefs and decided to start from scratch.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.129
If he examined each possible belief carefully,
and only accepted those about which there

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.989
could be no doubt, then he’d know he was
believing only true things.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.560
So, Descartes began the arduous task of examining
his beliefs one by one.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.940
He started with empirical beliefs – things we come to know directly through the use of our senses.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.959
And many of us think that our senses are the
most reliable source of information. If I

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.180
can see it, and hear it, touch it, taste it,
smell it, I must know it, right?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.620
Not so much. Descartes pointed out that our
senses fail us all the time.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.099
You rush to catch up to a friend and realize,
as she turns around, that your eyes played

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.340
some tricks on you, and you’ve just tapped
the shoulder of a perfect stranger.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.450
Food tastes wrong when you’re sick. Drink
too much and you feel like the room is spinning.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.219
Water that’s room temperature feels hot
when you come inside after playing in the snow.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.979
The list goes on – you can probably think of countless times when your senses gave you faulty information.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.180
And once you realize that, how can you ever
trust your senses again?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.300
And for Descartes, disbeliever of everything,
iit got worse.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.110
Have you ever had a dream so vivid you thought
you were awake?

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.820
You’ve probably had a dream that you were
dreaming, or dreamed that you woke up from

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.070
a dream, but in fact were still in the dream.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.310
Not everyone has had these experiences, but
many of us have, and given that we don’t

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.770
always know that we’re dreaming while it’s
happening...

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.400
HOW DO WE KNOW WE’RE NOT DREAMING RIGHT
NOW?!

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.100
Maybe you just think you’re watching Crash Course,
but in fact, you’re cozied up in bed, dreaming about me.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.800
Which, hey, like, who could blame you?

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.720
But really, when you think about it, can you
be SURE it’s not the case?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.490
Now, you might be thinking, ok, sure, I probably
deceive myself from time to time, without

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.200
knowing I’m doing it. But dreams end. And
when I wake up, I realize that what I thought

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.080
I was experiencing was all in my head.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.700
And the same is true for when my senses let
me down.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.700
Those are just temporary instances, isolated
to a particular situation. As soon as the

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.230
situation changes, I can realize that my experience
was false.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.360
This quality – the ability to check in with
yourself and figure out that you’re experiencing

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.840
a deception – describes what Descartes called
local doubts.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.940
Those are doubts about a particular sense experience, or some other occurrence at a particular point in time.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.560
Step out of that point, and you can check
to determine if you’ve been deceived.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.180
But what if ... EVERYTHING IS A DECEPTION?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.070
What if everyone is experiencing the same
false reality, from birth until death? What

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.820
if nothing is as it seems, just like in The
Matrix?

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.380
This type of doubt, the kind you can’t step out of,
and thus can’t check, is called global doubt.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.280
And it’s the subject of this week’s Flash Philosophy.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.020
Philosopher Bertrand Russell illustrated the
concept of global doubt with this troubling thought:

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.130
What if the universe was created just five
minutes ago?

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.090
In this scenario, known as the Five Minute
Hypothesis, the creator of the universe could

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.790
have designed many elements of the world to
make them appear “pre-worn,” so as to seem old.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.400
From dinosaur bones – fashioned by the creator,
and planted for us to find, to that scar on

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.800
your knee – put there by the creator, along with
the pre-loaded false memory of how you got it.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.620
It seems crazy, but there’s just no way
to prove that it isn’t the case.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.540
The question for Russell was -- does it matter?
Descartes thought it did.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.550
But as a good Catholic, he couldn’t fathom
a world in which God would plant globally

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.410
false beliefs in all of our minds.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.370
So instead, he posited the existence of an
Evil Genius, whose purpose in life was to

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.710
deceive us, and who was clever enough to do it.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.930
Descartes didn’t exactly think such a being
was likely to exist. But he realized there

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:42.680
was no way to rule out his existence. And
as long as an Evil Genius was possible, he worried

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.020
that we were all stuck. Stuck in a radical skepticism, in which we really cannot trust any of our beliefs.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.640
Everything we believe, every sense experience, every thought, they could all have been put in our minds

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:01.400
by the Evil Genius, who created an illusory world so seamless, we’d have no way of detecting the illusion.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.700
Just like the machines created for the characters
in The Matrix.

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.120
Descartes was at the point of despair.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.160
But then...he realized something.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.580
He had cause to doubt everything.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.840
Everything EXCEPT the fact that he was doubting.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.560
He knew he was doubting. He could be sure
of that.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:22.200
And if he was doubting, then he must exist
– at least as a thinking thing.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.280
After all, a doubt is a thought, and if there is thought, there must be a thinker having those thoughts.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:31.360
So Descartes decided that he couldn’t know
that he had a body – what he believed to

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:36.300
be his body could’ve been part of the Evil Genius’ deception. But he must have had a mind,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.060
or he couldn’t have been having these thoughts.
This was Descartes’s ah-ha moment.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.300
In his book, Meditations on First
Philosophy, he declared:

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.800
Cogito ergo sum.
“I think, therefore, I am.”

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.940
It’s one of the most famous realizations
in philosophy – I cannot doubt my own existence.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.100
I can doubt everything else, but I can’t
doubt I am, bare minimum, a mind having thoughts.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.720
This was Descartes’ foundational belief,
the first belief he put back in his apple basket.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.880
And from there, he figured he could
build back up to more certain beliefs.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.900
Once he was certain that he was a thinking
thing, he began examining his thoughts.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:15.280
And one of his most clear thoughts – what he called
a clear and distinct idea – was that God exists.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.660
He gave an argument for this – which we’re
going to examine in a later episode.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.320
But for now, take my word for it – it’s
got some problems.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:26.880
And from there, he considered his beliefs about the physical world, and concluded that it, too, actually exists.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.920
Ultimately, he determined, God wouldn’t
allow him to have clear and distinct ideas

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.579
that were false, without some way to detect
his own error. So, he concluded, the Evil

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:39.800
Genius is not actually fabricating lies that
consume our every waking moment.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.939
Descartes managed to reason from “cogito”
all the way back up to having basically all

00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:46.769
the beliefs he started with, back in his apple
basket.

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:52.720
Which is the story of how Rene Descartes, with the power of skepticism, defeated the threat of the Evil Genius.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.360
Much like how Neo ultimately short-circuited the Matrix, though considerably less impressive to watch, I imagine.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.560
He found certainty through his discovery of
the one belief that he simply couldn’t doubt

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.889
– his own existence as a thinking thing.

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:09.050
But, there is a lot of debate among philosophers
as to whether Descartes actually manages to

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.640
justifiably believe anything other than
that he exists as a thinking thing.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.700
And we’ll talk more about that more next time.
