00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.870
By the time we’re done today, I just might
have you questioning whether this apple is

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.660
real or not. Think I can’t do it? Gimme
about ten minutes! I might have you wondering

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.750
whether I’m a physical object or not.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.860
And the same goes for all of this stuff, and your
computer, and Nick behind the camera! And … you!

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.520
How? By unleashing the power of empiricism.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:37.300
[Theme Music]

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.179
Last time, we learned about 17th century philosopher
Rene Descartes, and how he upended the apple-basket

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.460
that was his entire personal belief system,
and descended into a radical skepticism, only

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.700
to emerge with his conviction that: Cogito
ergo sum – I think, therefore I am.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.280
This one idea -- the fact that he was thinking
-- or really, the fact that he was doubting

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.910
-- allowed him to build back up, one by one,
more beliefs that he thought he could rely on.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.780
But in the end, most of the beliefs that Descartes
ended up putting back into his intellectual

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.750
apple-basket had to do with the immaterial
world.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.090
Like, he decided that he could believe that
he existed, as a thinking thing.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.870
And he believed that God existed.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.140
Ultimately, he lit upon the idea that some
of our thoughts are clear and distinct in

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.530
a way that somehow guarantees their truth.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.950
But, a lot of philosophers disagreed. They
argued that thinking on its own wasn’t enough.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.469
Like, just because you’re thinking, doesn’t
mean that your thoughts correspond to material

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.549
reality in any reliable way.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.430
Basically, Descartes’ philosophical opponents
thought that the Cogito was a dead end.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.130
So here, we start to see a split between two
different understandings of how we can most

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.390
reliably get to the nature of reality, and
therefore truth. Both were responses to the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.910
constant questioning that is skepticism. On
the one hand, there was rationalism.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.780
And on the other: empiricism

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.620
Descartes, like Plato long before him, was a lover of reason. He met skepticism with rationalism.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.740
He believed that the most real things in life were ideas -- propositions that can be known through pure reason.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.920
Deductive truths, which we talked about before,
fall into this category. And mathematical truths do, too.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.670
But by contrast, empiricism is based on the
principle that the most reliable source of

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.670
knowledge isn’t our ideas, or our reasoning,
but our senses.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.910
Sure, we can know things through deduction
and basic logic.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.080
But what actually leads us to truth, or at
least gives us our best shot at getting there,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.630
are things like induction, and the scientific method -- ways of thinking that tell us about the material world.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.900
Probably the most famous split among philosophers
between these two camps was the life-long

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.230
debate between Plato and Aristotle.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.840
Plato was convinced that Truth resided in
the immaterial world of Ideas, while Aristotle’s

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.860
attention was focused firmly on the ground.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.170
But what about in Descartes’ day? If he
was the original prototype of the navel-gazing

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.120
philosopher -- a living example of rationalist
thinking — then his foil was was the 17th

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.410
century English thinker John Locke. This is
where he was born.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.290
Locke believed that we’re all born as a
tabula rasa, or a blank slate.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.070
He argued that all knowledge is
obtained through experience.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.240
He rejected the concept of innate ideas -- the
view that we’re born pre-loaded with certain

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.440
information, like what’s good versus what’s
bad, or what is the nature of God.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.960
Locke thought that we are born knowing nothing.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.220
And instead, all of our knowledge comes
to us through sense data.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.420
But one place where Locke agreed with Descartes
was in the idea that, just because your senses

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.440
tell you something, that doesn’t mean you
can trust it.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.900
After all, sometimes your senses give you
false information, like when you think you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.900
see or hear something that’s just not there.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.000
Descartes’ response to this, of course,
was to just throw out all sense experience

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.800
as an unreliable source of knowledge.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.700
But Locke didn’t go that far. Instead, in
order to figure out whether the senses accurately

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.120
reflect the outside world, he introduced a
distinction between what he called the primary

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.360
and secondary qualities of all things.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.460
Primary qualities are qualities that physical
objects themselves have. They’re not in

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.010
our minds, Locke argued -- they’re actually
in the stuff. These primary qualities include

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.840
things like solidity -- the density, weight,
and mass of an object. And also extension

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.400
-- the height, depth, and width that a certain
thing has. He also included figure, or the

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.980
shape of an object, as well as mobility, which
is this – whether it’s stationary or in motion.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.740
So primary qualities, Locke said, belong to
the thing itself.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.000
Take this apple. It weighs maybe 150 grams,
is the size of my palm, roundish, but firm,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.480
with the slightest bit of give, and right
now it’s moving through the air.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.060
Those are its primary qualities.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.860
But it has secondary qualities, too.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.620
And by Locke’s standards, they are not real.
At least not in any objective, agreed-upon way.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.840
They’re just in our minds. But they
get there through the primary qualities.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.770
I’m talking about things like its color, taste,
texture, smell, and sound.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.469
The secondary qualities of this apple are
its redness, and how it tastes and smells

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.539
and feels on my tongue and hand. Even how
it sounds when I bite into it.

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:46.090
Locke believed that the distinction between
primary and secondary qualities explained

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.849
the disagreements that we all have about our
perceptions of the outside world.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.039
Like, we could measure this apple in a bunch
of ways and all agree on its primary qualities,

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.319
but its secondary qualities would no doubt
lead to some disputes.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.289
Like, is it really red? What kind of red exactly?
Cardinal red? Or carmine red? It’s kind

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.400
of dark purple at the top -- or is it just
like a dark pink?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.880
What about the sound it made? Would I call that
crunchy? Or crispy? Or...bite-y? It’s like, apple sound.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.520
We could argue about that kind of stuff til
the cows came home.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.139
But if we disagree about its primary qualities
– one of us is simply wrong. Because primary

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.919
qualities have nothing to do with you, or me. Instead they have everything to do with the object itself.

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.330
Locke’s reasoning was simple, even elegant,
extracting a lot of explanatory power out

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.409
of very few basic concepts. As a result, it
resonated with a lot people.

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.729
And one person it resonated strongly with
was the Irish philosopher George Berkeley.

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.300
He was moved by Locke’s empiricism and took
it seriously -- so seriously, in fact, that

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.090
ended up using Locke’s own logic against
him.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:48.560
He basically took empiricism to its logical
conclusion, dismantling the whole process

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.159
of perception to the point that he had to
wonder whether anything existed at all.

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.559
Berkeley began by taking apart the distinction that Locke made between primary and secondary qualities.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.080
Like, think about this apple again. How do
you know its shape?

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.979
Locke said that the apple’s shape, as a
primary quality, is immediately perceivable.

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.259
But Berkeley pointed out that you don’t
perceive some qualities of an object, while

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.059
totally disregarding others. Like, you can’t
detect an apple’s shape without first --

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.620
or at least without also -- detecting its color.
When you think about it, you can’t detect

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.240
any of the primary qualities without also
considering the secondary ones.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.999
You can’t see a colorless apple.
You can’t feel a textureless apple.

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:26.659
In fact, if you try to strip away the apple’s
secondary qualities in an effort to get at

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.529
the primary ones, you end up with no apple
at all.

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.349
Try it: Close your eyes and imagine an apple
made of only primary qualities -- so, it has

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:38.039
a certain shape and a certain size, but it
doesn’t have any color or texture or taste.

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:38.960
You can’t do it.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.400
You try to imagine it with no color, but really,
you’re probably imagining one that’s either

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.469
black or white or transparent -- the color
of what’s behind it.

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:48.990
And if you try to imagine it as having no
texture, you’ll find there’s still a texture

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.529
there – it’s just smooth.

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.759
Remember: Locke asserted that secondary qualities
are not objectively real. They can only be

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:59.770
subjectively perceived. But now, Berkeley
has shown that the two are inextricably linked

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.870
– you can’t have one without the other.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.419
Which means that primary qualities can’t
be real, either. They, too, are just what

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.090
your mind makes of things.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.430
So this led Berkeley to a startling conclusion:
There’s just no such thing as matter.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.850
There can’t be! Instead, there’s only
perceptions.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:20.300
Berkeley’s famous assertion --
his version of cogito ergo sum --

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:23.999
was esse est percepi:
“to be is to be perceived.”

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:28.529
In his opinion, there are no objects, only
perceivers – and even then, the perceivers

00:07:28.529 --> 00:07:34.150
themselves don’t really have any physical
form. They’re just disembodied minds perceiving

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:36.099
things that aren’t really there.

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.689
A little bit terrifying when you start thinking
about it.

00:07:38.689 --> 00:07:42.659
In Berkeley’s scenario, we’re all set
adrift in a world of nothing but thought.

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:46.659
What’s scary about it is this, if everything’s
just perception, then when the perception

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:49.080
goes away, there can’t be anything left.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.900
So like, please, for the love of Pete, do
not turn away from your computer! If you stop

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.150
perceiving me, I stop existing!

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.379
But, what if maybe you don’t care about
me? Still, you’d better not go to sleep,

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:01.620
because as soon as you do, you’ll cease
to exist! Because, you won’t be able to

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:05.650
perceive yourself! The only guarantee that
you’ll continue to exist in your sleep is

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.120
to have a friend watch you when you’re sleeping. Which probably is a non-starter, for a number of reasons.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.800
But in any case, the second your
friend blinks, you’re gone!

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:17.069
So in the end, Berkeley believed there was
only one thing that kept us --

00:08:17.069 --> 00:08:19.939
and everything else -- from disappearing into oblivion.

00:08:19.939 --> 00:08:23.419
God.
Berkeley believed that God was the Ultimate Perceiver.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:29.810
God is always watching, with unblinking perception that holds objects in existence even when we’re not paying attention.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.710
The tough thing about Berkeley is, we all
pretty much think he has to be wrong.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.500
Very few of us are willing to give up our belief in the physical world — no matter who’s watching.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.860
We are sensory animals!
We really need this apple to exist.

00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.140
Next time, we’re going to take a side journey
into the world of knowledge. And then, in

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:49.680
episode 8, we’ll see if Karl Popper can
manage to get the physical world back for us.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.690
Today we have learned about empiricism as
a response to skepticism. We talked about

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.120
John Locke and his distinction between primary
and secondary qualities. And we’ve seen

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.370
why George Berkeley thinks that distinction
ultimately falls apart -- leaving us with

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:06.210
literally nothing but our minds, ideas, and
perceptions.
