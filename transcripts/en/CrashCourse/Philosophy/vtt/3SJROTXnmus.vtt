00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.940
On September 13, 1848, a freak accident caused
an explosion

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.860
that drove an iron rod straight into the skull
of a worker named Phineas Gage.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.860
A metal rod almost as tall as he was went
through his skull – and he didn’t die.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.820
But, the Phineas from before the accident, and the one who lived after it, didn’t seem to have a lot in common, personality-wise.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.360
The Phineas with no hole in his brain was
a proper, hard-working gentleman.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.520
And the Phineas with the injured brain was,
uh, sort of a belligerent jerk.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.980
Phineas’ brain was changed – and his personality
changed too.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.280
This misfortune has provided lots of fodder
for researchers of psychology and neurology.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.670
But the case of Phineas Gage holds lessons
for philosophers too.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.850
It provides us with some rare, hard evidence that a part of us that's historically been thought of as non-physical

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.839
– our personality – is actually, directly
affected by what happens to us physically.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.700
Which raises the question: Where does our
mind reside?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.760
[Theme Music]

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.700
Now, not a lot of contemporary scientists would be all that surprised that an injury like the one Gage suffered could cause such a radical change.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.860
That's because the dominant view held in much of Western science is what we call reductive physicalism.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.119
This is the view that the world is made only
of physical stuff, including us.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.580
By this logic, everything about me, and you,
can be explained in terms of our bodies

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.280
– our brains, hormones, and neurotransmitters.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.080
So if everything about Phineas’s personality
could be explained in terms of his brain,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.480
it’s no shock that a radical change in his brain would bring about a radical change in his personality.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.720
This same belief is at work when a psychiatrist
prescribes antidepressants to a patient.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.880
Change the patient's brain chemistry, change
the patient's mood.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.980
Now, physicalism may be the default scientific position, but remember, way back in episode 5,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.720
our old friend Rene Descartes introduced us to cogito ergo sum – I think, therefore, I am.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.160
Descartes believed that he could cast doubt on the existence of his body, but not the existence of his mind.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.060
The fact that he could doubt one but not the other told him that he must be made of two different kinds of stuff.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.540
This view, known as Substance Dualism, says that the world is made of both physical stuff and mental stuff.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.000
Substance dualists say that minds are a separate, nonphysical substance that cannot be reduced to,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.940
or explained in terms of, physical stuff,
like brains.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.100
And in this view, some things – like God – are pure mind, and other things – like rocks – are pure matter.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.750
But humans, well, we’re kinda special.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.620
We’re the only kind of thing that combines both stuffs in one being – both body and mind.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.720
What’s more, these two substances appear
to interact with each other inside of us.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.630
This is called interactionism.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.550
When I “make up my mind” to do something,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.670
I have the power to compel my body to do as
I please –

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.190
to get up off the couch and make myself a
nice pb and j, for example.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.660
What’s more, my mental states seem to have the ability to affect my physical states even against my will.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.440
You ever notice how many people who are grieving or under a lot of stress, for example, often get physically sick?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.600
Likewise, our bodies also appear to be able
to affect our minds.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.340
Like when you’re so hungry you just can’t
focus on what your teacher is saying at all.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.920
Or how a pure physical pleasure – like having a good cuddle with your cat – can pull you out of a bad mood.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.660
Interactionists say that what's going on is that our two substances – minds and bodies – are interacting with each other.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.260
But, if you think about it, this is actually
a pretty puzzling proposition.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.120
How can a purely mental thing have any affect
on a purely physical thing?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.420
The puzzle of how minds and bodies can interact with each other is known as the Mind-Body Problem.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.300
This is the problem that makes us wonder:

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.650
How can my body have a separate entity called
a mind lurking inside of it –

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.070
controlling it, and being controlled by it?

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.940
What would tether my mind to this body in
particular –

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.400
why couldn’t my mind just go running off on its own, or take a dip into other bodies to see what it’s like in there?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.300
Descartes’ answer, frankly, wasn’t all
that satisfying.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.900
He said that the mind is tethered to the body at the pineal gland – located at the base of the brain –

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.320
and that all mind-body interactions are filtered through that portal, if you will, between the mind and the body.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.540
But that really only pushes the problem back,
without solving it,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.340
since the pineal gland is part of the physical
body.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.480
Many modern philosophers of mind, seeing no
way to solve the mind-body problem,

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.600
have felt compelled to abandon substance dualism
altogether.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.960
Some are happy to be physicalists, but others
are convinced that there are some parts of

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.870
human experience that simply can’t be boiled
down to brains.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.300
To see what they think is being left out, let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.560
Contemporary Australian philosopher Frank Jackson presents us with the thought experiment of Mary,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.140
a woman who has spent her entire life in a black and white room, learning everything via a black and white television.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.440
While locked in this room, Mary becomes a neurophysicist specializing in the science of color.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.259
She learns everything there is to know about
light, optics, the physics of color,

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.979
and how it affects our sensory organs, but
she has never seen it for herself.

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.569
So here’s the question:

00:04:54.569 --> 00:05:00.220
When Mary finally walks out of the room and sees color for the first time, has Mary learned something new?

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.360
Jackson devised this thought experiment as
an argument against reductive physicalism.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.580
Because, Jackson says, the qualitative experience of seeing a color – say, red – isn't the same as knowing facts about red.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.960
If everything could be explained in terms of the physical, then when Mary finally saw red,

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.820
it wouldn’t have contributed to her understanding
at all.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.550
It wouldn’t have told her anything that
she didn’t already know.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.690
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.360
What’s missing from a physicalist account,
many argue, is what are known as qualia

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.349
– instances of subjective, first-person
experience.

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.900
Qualia are what it feels like to stub your
toe,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.819
or take the first bite out of a slice of pizza,

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.320
or to learn that you have been deeply betrayed
by a trusted friend.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.780
It’s what Mary is said to gain when she steps out of the room and sees color for the first time.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.140
Physicalists respond to thought experiments like Jackson’s by arguing that they beg the question.

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.999
Begging the question, you'll recall, is a
philosophical fallacy in which the premises

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:54.939
assume the conclusion they’re supposed to
be proving.

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.020
Jackson’s thought experiment assumes that Mary learns something new when she steps out of the room.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.880
But, if physicalism is true, and if she really
knows everything physical about color,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.780
then of course seeing it for herself isn’t going to add to her understanding of it in any way.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.380
Now, physicalists argue that their case is
making progress,

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.720
as we learn more and more about the physical
processes of the mind.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.379
Well that’s not really satisfying, because
we want an answer, not a promissory note.

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.340
But, to be fair, physicalists have only been
at work for a few decades,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.879
while dualists have been bashing their heads
against the mind-body problem for centuries.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.490
But not everybody falls cleanly into either
the physicalist or the dualist camp.

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.800
The Mary case, and other arguments like it, convince some people that they have to maintain their commitment to dualism,

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.730
even though they can’t see a solution to
the mind-body problem.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.490
Some of those people adopt a view called epiphenomenalism.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:44.729
This view says that physical states can give rise to mental states, but mental states can’t affect physical states.

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.189
So by this thinking, your beliefs, desires,
and temperaments do exist,

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:51.340
but they have no power over anything physical
about you.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.520
Which might sound kind of weird and unconvincing.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.600
But then there’s contemporary British philosopher Colin McGinn, who advocates a view called mysterianism.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.060
This says that the question of consciousness
is unsolvable by human minds.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.909
It’s not that McGinn thinks we’re dummies.

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:08.699
He thinks humans are natural knowers – just
give us a problem and we can figure it out.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:09.699
But not this.

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.259
The reason, he says, is that our brains are
compartmentalized.

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:15.129
The way we understand our mind is through
reflection.

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:17.370
It’s deeply personal and subjective.

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.860
But the way we understand our brains and bodies
is objective, and verifiable.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.889
And those two modes of understanding just
don’t mix.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:28.499
No amount of reflection could lead to any
claims about neurons firing,

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.960
and no amount of empirical research is going to give rise to what it’s like to see color through someone else’s eyes.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.440
Our brains just don’t have a compartment that can piece together those different modes of evidence.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.320
The mind-body problem hasn’t been solved,
and physicalism hasn’t been proven, because

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.120
both of those things require our brains to
do something they can’t do.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.120
So what do you think?

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.740
Is your mind a separate substance, riding
around in your body until it dies?

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.129
Can the complicated thing that is you – that
thinks and feels and desires and hurts – be

00:07:56.129 --> 00:07:58.180
reduced to a purely physical thing?

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.420
Did Mary learn something new?
Is it possible to know?

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.719
Well that is up to your mind to figure out.

00:08:03.719 --> 00:08:06.689
Today we talked about theories about where
the mind resides.

00:08:06.689 --> 00:08:10.509
We learned about reductive physicalism, substance
dualism, and mysterianism.

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:13.889
And next time, we’re going to think about
these issues some more,

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:18.259
with the help of some of my favorite kinds
of potential persons – robots!
