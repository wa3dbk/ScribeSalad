00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:10.260
Why is the sky blue?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.020
Which came first: orange the color or orange
the fruit?

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.060
And why is C3PO afraid of everything? Like, who decided it was a good idea to teach a droid to experience fear?

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.320
There are some questions that we ask ourselves,
either as kids, or adults, or both.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.869
They’re questions about weird, everyday
things, and they’re weird because most of

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.650
us don’t know the answers to them offhand.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.710
But most of the time, those questions turn
out to be pretty answerable.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.710
Like, for the ones I just mentioned, the short
answers are:

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.170
Because of the way photons interact with the
molecules in the atmosphere.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.250
...the fruit;
And…uh…’cause that’s what George Lucas wanted.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.550
Maybe because 3PO’s a protocol droid, and
they need to be able to relate to humans.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.200
Though, he could stand to turn his fear settings
down a notch.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.520
Now, as you know, philosophers have a soft
spot for questions that can never be answered.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.860
Most of the time, these puzzles make for great thought experiments – tests of our skills in logic and argument.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.380
But there are some questions whose very lack
of an answer can be downright troubling.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.979
Unlike the occasional fluke of physics or bit of Star Wars trivia, there’s a part of us that really wants,

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.619
or even needs to have an answer to these things.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.590
For the past month or so, we’ve been exploring
the philosophy of religion,

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.110
and we’ve been doing it mainly from a theistic perspective, looking into arguments that justify belief in God.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.860
But one of the most persistent challenges to god’s existence is also the root of one of the most-asked,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.840
but least answerable, questions that we, as
thinking beings, face.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.720
Why is there evil?

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:38.180
[Theme Music]

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.600
Evil comes in many forms.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.780
And likewise, for philosophers, poses many problems, especially vis a vis the existence of god.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.020
First, there’s what’s known as the logical
problem of evil.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.479
Like all rational people, theists can’t help but acknowledge that the world is full of evil.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.419
And here, we’re understanding “evil” to be all manner of bad stuff – like, not just Hitler or Darth Vader or Moriarty.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.630
It’s everything that’s in the vast spectrum of badness, from stubbed toes to plagues and everything in between.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.570
Theists and atheists both agree that evil exists in this way. But they disagree about the next part.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.739
Many theists believe in an omniscient, omnipotent,
omnibenevolent God.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.079
But atheists argue that this creates a contradiction – a set of beliefs that can’t all be true at the same time.

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:22.319
Because, evil is bad, right – whether it’s stubbed toes or genocide or paper cuts or epidemics?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.239
So, if there’s really an all-knowing God
out there, he knows about all the evil.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.299
He might even know about it before it happens.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.549
And if he’s all-powerful, he could stop
it.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.040
And if he’s all-good, then he would want
to stop it.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.159
And yet he doesn’t. The evil continues.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.349
Philosophically rational people shouldn’t
hold inconsistent beliefs,

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.369
so atheists argue that you’re going to have to give something up – and the thing to give up is God.

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:47.620
Some theists, however, take a different route.
They choose to give up one or more divine attributes.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.629
They argue that maybe God isn’t powerful
enough to stop evil,

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.040
or maybe he’s not knowledgeable enough to
know about it,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.020
or maybe he’s not even good enough to care
about stopping it.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.340
That might sound weird to some of you,

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.649
but if you’ve ever heard someone say that
God is envious, or petty, or jealous,

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.080
that’s basically what they’re doing –

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.100
they’re acknowledging the possibility that
God is not actually good.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.769
If you’ve ever checked out the Old Testament, there is a God there who has some anger issues –

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.169
one who’s not at all opposed to wiping out entire populations just because of some bad behavior.

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:17.230
Still, despite this scriptural evidence, many
theists are committed to God’s omni-attributes,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.419
and are thus stuck with a problem. They
have to resolve the logical problem of evil

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.989
and find some way to explain why God would
allow evil into the world.

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.359
And if you can do that, then you are presenting
what is known as a theodicy.

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.659
A theodicy is an attempt to show that the existence of evil doesn’t rule out the possibility of God’s existence.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.359
Yes, this is such a big deal that there’s
a word for it.

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.430
And the most popular theodicy is called The
Free Will Defense.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.249
This argument holds that God maximized the
goodness in the world by creating free beings.

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:49.629
And being free means that we have the choice to do evil things – a choice that some of us exercise.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.580
This theodicy says that God doesn’t create evil, but evil can’t be avoided without depriving us of our freedom.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.280
And a world without freedom would be a worse
place overall.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.329
This explanation preserves God’s goodness,
because he created the best possible world,

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.879
and also preserves his omnipotence and omniscience,
because,

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.439
although he does know about evil and could stop it, he has a good reason not to – to ensure our freedom.

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:15.809
The problem is, the free will defense really only really addresses what’s known as moral evil –

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:18.090
or the evil committed, on purpose, by humans.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.010
Now, we’re certainly responsible for a lot of bad stuff, but you can’t blame us for everything.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.860
We can’t be held responsible for the fact
that the plates of the earth sometimes shift,

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.990
causing destructive earthquakes, or that a storm might knock a tree over that falls onto someone’s house.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.120
This type of evil – the stuff we’re not
responsible for – is called natural evil,

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.629
and the free will defense can’t resolve
natural evil.

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:41.409
Religion is one of those philosophical issues that can make it hard for us to consider anything objectively.

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:46.039
That’s where fiction comes in handy because
fictional stories can let us see how hypothetical

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.259
people deal with hypothetical situations.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.580
And with that in mind, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy!

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.860
Let’s consider the case of Ivan, a good
Russian who decides to break up with God.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.210
In the novel The Brothers Karamozov, 19th century Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky presents us with Ivan,

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.479
a man who claims to believe in God.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.779
But Ivan finds the fact that God allows evil
to exist to be so unforgivable,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.740
that he decides worshipping such a god would
be, just, unconscionable.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.120
Ivan goes so far as to declare that he is
“returning his ticket” to heaven.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.150
If the same God who allows evil – particularly
the suffering and death of children –

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:25.650
is also saving a cozy place in paradise for
Ivan, well, Ivan wants nothing to do with it.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.150
So, his way out of the problem of evil is
to deny God’s goodness,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.969
and to conclude that a bad God is not only
unworthy of his worship,

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:36.089
he’s also not someone Ivan wants to spend 
eternity with.

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.880
It’s like the ultimate un-friending.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.740
Now, some readers have found Ivan’s decision
to be noble, and full of integrity.

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.280
After all, if you really think God is letting all of this bad stuff happen, why would you want to be on his team?

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.900
But other people think Ivan is being irrational – why condemn yourself to eternity in hell on principle?

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.909
For theists, it’s another question that
doesn’t have an easy answer.

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:59.340
Thanks, Thought Bubble! Now, unlike Ivan, a lot of people aren’t willing to give up their ticket to heaven.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.460
So they need to work on a way to keeping believing in, and worshipping, God, even though evil is still a thing.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.080
One way to do that, is to argue that good
can’t exist without its opposite.

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.819
The idea here is that you can’t understand
the concept of pleasure without pain.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.400
We don’t know what it feels like to be warm
if we haven’t been cold.

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.830
We can’t understand the goodness of filling
our bellies if we’ve never been hungry.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.340
But there’s also another way, though it
involves a little more work on your part.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:27.680
20th century English philosopher of religion John Hick offered what’s known as the soul-making theodicy.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.699
Unlike the traditional view that God created
a perfect world,

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.539
which we ruined through our own poor choices, Hick argued that God deliberately creates us “unfinished,”

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.240
and our earthly lives are designed to toughen
us up, in a sense, kinda like boot camp.

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.560
The harshness of life, Hick said, gives us
a robust texture and character that wouldn’t

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.219
be possible without an imperfect world.

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:52.349
Hick said that we’re not just God’s little
pets, and he’s not our benevolent owner,

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:55.259
whose sole job is to keep us in a safe, comfortable
environment.

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:59.519
Instead, he wants to build us, to train us,
into a particular kind of being.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.580
So we need an environment that’s suited
to the sort of growth that he wants –

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.719
the sort that this world makes possible.

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.159
A lot of people find these and other theodicies
to be pretty compelling.

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:11.740
However, the problem of evil actually goes
a step deeper.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.340
What we’ve been talking about so far is
the logical problem of evil.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.520
This problem can be resolved, if we can explain
why there’s evil.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.749
But there’s also the evidential problem
of evil.

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:25.689
This problem points out that we might be able
to explain why evil exists,

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:28.969
but we still can’t explain why there’s
so much evil in the world.

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:33.199
For instance, let’s say that it’s true that we really do need evil in order to understand goodness.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:37.959
In that case, why can’t we understand the
contrast through some sort of low-level evil –

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.480
like paper cuts and head colds and having to work straight through our lunch hour every now and then?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.560
I mean, slow, painful deaths from cancer,
and city-destroying hurricanes…

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.210
they don’t really add anything valuable
to our understanding of goodness. Do they?

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.360
If God were truly good, and if a negative
contrast were really needed in order for us

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.639
to understand the goodness of the world, then
why wouldn’t he give us just the very minimum

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:02.550
dosage of necessary to achieve that goal?

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:08.170
A counterargument might suggest that there’s always a good that corresponds to, and is proportionate to, any evil.

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:11.360
But empirically, such goodness is really hard
to find.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.830
What good, for example, could possibly correspond
to the horrors of a genocide?

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.759
In cases like this, Hick’s soul-making doesn’t
seem to cut it.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:21.139
You can’t really argue that “whatever
doesn’t kill us makes us stronger,” because,

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:24.099
sometimes, evil does kill us. A lot of us.

00:08:24.099 --> 00:08:28.379
And sometimes it kills us before we have a chance to grow and learn from the suffering we’ve endured.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:33.560
Despite these and other philosophical sticking points, a lot of people have found a theodicy that satisfies them –

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:37.510
one that they believe reconciles the apparent
evil in the world with God’s existence.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.810
Others find all of these theodicies to be
flawed, and they reject God’s omni-nature,

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:47.200
preserving their belief in God by finding him to be less than perfectly powerful, or knowledgeable, or good.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.980
Still others are convinced that the evil in the world is simply incompatible with the existence of a god,

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.970
or at least any god worth worshipping.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.650
Wherever you end up, this is a problem that
needs to be grappled with.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.700
And you’ll probably be thinking about it
long after this lesson has ended.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:04.300
After all, today we have considered the biggest
problem in theism – the problem of evil.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.120
We’ve thought about different theodicies
– or ways that we might reconcile the existence

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.959
of evil and the existence of god,

00:09:09.959 --> 00:09:12.579
and we’ve explored whether those responses
are sufficient.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.120
Next time, we’ll consider what kinds of justification we need to have for our religious beliefs.
