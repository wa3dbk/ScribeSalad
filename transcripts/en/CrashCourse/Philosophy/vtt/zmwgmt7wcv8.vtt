00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.320
What is a game?
Easy question, right?

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.980
You know what a game is – there’s basketball, Chutes and Ladders, Dungeon and Dragons, tennis, Wizard School!

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.120
But those are examples of games.
What I’m asking for is the definition of a game.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.500
Maybe, if you haven’t been keeping up with
Crash Course Games, you’d simply say that,

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.120
a game is a competition, with winners and
losers.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.970
But, what about a game like ring around the
rosie?

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.470
Does a game require at least two players?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.411
No, there is literally a game called solitaire
solitaire.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.320
Maybe a game is just a thing you do for fun.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.480
But what about “who can stay quiet the longest”
–

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.120
the game that your parents used to use on
long car trips?

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.800
Or, like, Russian roulette?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.820
Or The Game of Thrones, where you win or you
die?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.620
When it comes to language, there’s a lot
to philosophize about.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.029
But one question that philosophers of language
like to mull is the question of meaning.

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:52.380
What do words – like ‘game’ or ‘red’ or ‘banana’
What do they mean?

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.500
How do we know what they mean?

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.100
And who gets to decide?

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:06.660
[Theme Music]

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.860
Language is one of our most nuanced and powerful
tools.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.760
It takes all of the stuff that’s swirling around in each of our lonely, isolated brains – all those thoughts – and transfers them into someone else’s brain.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.020
Which is really, fabulously cool.
It’s like telepathy!

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.640
But with the extra step of actually speaking
or writing.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.859
But, how do words – a collection of  sounds or written symbols – key into the mental concepts that we want to communicate?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.080
The naive understanding of what words mean is just that they’re just whatever the dictionary says.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.740
But we know that’s not totally true.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.020
Think about the difference between words like ‘cat,’ ‘kitty,’ ‘mouser,’ and ‘feline’.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.920
Early 20th century German philosopher Gottlab Frege helped parse out this difference by drawing a distinction between what he called sense, and reference.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.680
The reference of a word is the object or concept
that it’s meant to designate.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.660
The reference of all these words is this.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.760
Sense, on the other hand, is the way in which
the words tie us to the object or concept.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.660
So, while the reference of each of these words
is the same, they have different senses.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.780
A kitty might be a baby cat, or sort of fancy
lap cat,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.229
while a mouser might be a cat that lives in
a barn and kills rodents for a living.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.030
So how do words get their meaning?

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.770
A definition is traditionally understood as whatever meets the conditions for both necessity and sufficiency.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.240
A necessary condition is what’s needed – like, what must be present – in order for a thing to be a thing.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.111
In order for X to be X.

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:27.140
A necessary condition of being a bachelor,
for example, is that you must be unmarried.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.950
A sufficient condition is something that’s
enough for X to be X,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.000
but it’s not required for that thing to
meet that definition.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.280
For example, being born in the United States is a sufficient condition for being an American citizen.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.960
But it’s not a necessary condition, because people who weren’t born in the US can still become citizens.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.460
The long-standing view of definitions was that, if you can figure out both the necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be X, then you’ll have your definition.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.080
That is, you’ll have found the criteria
that exclude all non-X’s, but include all X’s.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.320
If you’re following me.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.820
But 20th century Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein said this rigid concept of definitions doesn’t actually work.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.040
For example, you just can’t define the word ‘game’ in a way that’s going to make everybody happy.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.820
Any definition you give, someone’s going
to come up with a counterexample –

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.230
either some game that’s excluded by the
definition,

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.000
or something that the definition includes
that not everyone would agree is a game.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.780
It took Andre and entire 10 minute episode
to define games!

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.380
But the thing is, Wittgenstein said this doesn’t matter!

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.640
Because, everyone knows what a game is!

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.320
He pointed out that we learn and know the
meaning of words

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.610
by hearing the way other members of our linguistic
community use them.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.870
We hear Candyland, rugby, and Cards Against
Humanity all referred to as games,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.180
so eventually our brains piece together what’s
common between them,

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.200
in a recognition that Wittgenstein called
family resemblance.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.560
You know how you can just see the relation
between people sometimes?

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:50.980
Rather than rigid definitions, Wittgenstein
said word meanings are so-called cluster concepts.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.440
There’s no one element that everything in
the cluster has in common,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.230
but they all share something with some other
members of the group.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.190
It’s sort of like you have your dad’s
nose and your mom’s sense of humor,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.250
and your sister has your mom’s eyes and
your dad’s athleticism.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.310
You and your sister don’t really have much
in common, but you do both resemble both parents.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.460
But it’s not like every concept in the cluster
is equal.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.840
The ones that everyone would accept are the paradigm cases – you can picture them in the center of the
cluster.

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.240
And as you move to the outer edges you’ll get fringe cases, the ones that some people would include in the group but others would exclude.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.960
Everyone will agree that football is a game, but there’s going to be some disagreement about things like,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.860
I don’t know, knife fights, or how long
you can hold your breath under water.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.680
And Wittgenstein said that’s fine.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.500
Language is a living phenomenon, and like most living things, there’s going to be change and variation.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.960
But who gets to decide what words mean, or
if a meaning is legitimate?

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.850
Here, Wittgenstein said, “meaning is use.”

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.180
In other words, as long as a linguistic community uses a word in a particular way, it has that meaning.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.880
Watching the way words develop and change does suggest that Wittgenstein was onto something.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.000
I mean, ‘mouse’ didn’t used to mean
that thing, but now it does.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.070
We make words up as we need them.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.050
And at the same time, words also fall out
of use, or take on entirely new meanings.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.270
Now, this view of language assumes that meaning
is tied to a particular linguistic communities.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.330
And a community might, or might not, span
all of the speakers of that language.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:16.139
Think about the regional differences in words that might be specific to your town, or school, or group of friends, or family.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.180
And what about this: Do you and your best friend have code words – words that you use to talk privately, even when you’re in public?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.840
Like, the two of you could be at a club, and
one of you would say to the other:

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.180
“That guy at the bar is a total shoehorn” and the other one would know exactly what you meant?

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.820
In that case, do those words, that have meaning
specific to the two of you,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.980
really mean what you say they mean, even if
no one else agrees with you?

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.690
And what happens if the two of you forget
that meaning?

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.100
Is the meaning still there?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.330
Or does it only exist as long as someone uses
the word that way?

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.380
Let’s bounce over to the Thought Bubble
for a bit of Flash Philosophy.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.620
A linguistic community of two – like you
and your friend – seems fairly plausible.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.840
But is it possible to have an entirely private
language?

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.320
Wittgenstein asked us to imagine that each
of us has a box, and inside each box is something.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.620
We all refer to the thing in our box as ‘a beetle,’ but no one can see inside anyone else’s box, ever.

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.280
We all call our hidden thing a beetle, but we have no idea if the content of our boxes is the same.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.220
Wittgenstein said there’s no way we can meaningfully use the word ‘beetle’ in this context,

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.140
because we have no way of verifying what others mean when they use the word, and they have no way of verifying what we mean.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.140
This is meant to illustrate how it’s impossible
to directly communicate our subjective experiences.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.360
We all use the word ‘red’ to refer to
the color we see when we look at a stop sign,

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.340
but I have no way of knowing if you’re actually
seeing the same thing that I’m seeing.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.960
I don’t know if your pain feels like my
pain or your love feels like my love.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.980
Our minds are like boxes.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.000
No one else can see what’s inside.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.900
But here’s the thing: it doesn’t matter.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.640
Because ‘beetle’ just means, ‘what’s
in the box.’

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.200
It could literally be a beetle, or it could
be a fox! In socks!

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.560
The point is, we don’t know if the color red in my mind is the same as the color red in your mind, because the color red is a beetle in a box.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.080
It’s a label for what’s in our minds.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.740
So language, Wittgenstein said, can’t refer
directly to an internal state,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.540
like what it’s like to see the color red,
or to experience pain.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.389
Instead, it can only refer to the aspect of
it that’s publicly observable by other people.

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:19.840
So, the word ‘pain’ isn’t the feeling of physical suffering, it’s jumping on one foot and cursing when you stub a toe.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.480
It’s rubbing your temples when you have a headache – the observable behaviors that are associated with it.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.100
Thanks, Thought Bubble!
Now I want to propose an experiment.

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.400
If use is meaning, you should be able to give
a word meaning by using it, right?

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.060
At least, if you can convince a linguistic
community to go there with you.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.160
So let’s try it.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.040
If every Crash Course viewer starts referring to bananas as chom choms, can we make it catch on?

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.900
Can we create meaning?!

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:48.600
We’ll have to stay tuned for the answer to that one, but in the meantime, we can think about what might happen.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.460
And to do that, we need to make a distinction
between two different types of meaning.

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:57.300
When people communicate verbally, there’s speaker meaning, which is what the speaker intends when using a word.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.480
And then there’s audience meaning, which
is what the audience understands.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.180
Since the whole point of language is communication, our goal is for speaker meaning and audience meaning to match up.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.500
But, as anyone who’s ever, like, had a conversation,
knows, this doesn’t always work out.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.080
Like, Billy tells Bobby that he likes Sally.

00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:16.600
Billy, the speaker, means that he likes Sally
as a friend.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:21.139
Bobby, the audience, takes Billy’s statement
to be a profession of, like, you know, like-like.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:29.020
So Bobby then goes and tells Sally that Billy like-likes her, when in fact Billy actually like-likes Suzy, and pretty soon, you know how it goes. Tears.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.460
The point is, that even with a simple word
that we all think we understand, like ‘like,’

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.940
speaker meaning and audience meaning can fail
to connect.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:41.360
When we get into more complicated or nuanced words, or when we try to invent a new word, like chom chom,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.540
we’re likely to run into some pretty high-level
speaker-meaning/audience-meaning confusion.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.260
But for now, we learned about meaning.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:51.230
We talked about sense and reference, beetles
in boxes, and language games.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.360
And we learned that bananas are called chom choms.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.540
Repeat it with me: chom choms.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.260
Never say bananas again.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.550
Next time, we’re going to talk about another
linguistic concept – conversational implicature.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.950
