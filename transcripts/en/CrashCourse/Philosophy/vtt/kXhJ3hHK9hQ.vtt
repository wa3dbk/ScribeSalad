00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.240
You probably think you know a lot of things.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.840
But do you know what it means to know something?

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.070
We’ve spent quite a bit of time discussing
beliefs and knowledge, but we haven’t really

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.390
been specific about what we mean when we talk
about those things.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.640
Thankfully, philosophers love a good definition.
They have very specific and lucid ideas in

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.200
mind when they use terms like know or believe
or proposition or justification.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.240
And, about ten minutes from now, you too will know what you’re really saying when you use those words.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.900
But, just because these terms have been defined, doesn’t mean that philosophers aren’t still arguing over them.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.180
Because you know, that’s how philosophers
do.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.690
Their definitions might seem kind of obvious
at first, but the more you think about them,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.420
the more nuanced they turn out to be.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.879
Like, is having knowledge of something the
same thing as being correct?

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.299
Or, if you believe something to be true, and
it is true, does it matter if your belief in it is justified?

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.020
And can you be right about something without
really trying?

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.969
Answers to these questions and more await
you, as well as

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.349
cats!

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:14.009
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.680
So you’ve heard this already: Philosophers
love a good argument.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.509
But you’ve figured out by now that philosophers
argue in a different way than, like, kindergarten

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.079
kids, or Internet trolls, or other people
who confuse “arguing” with sniping back

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.119
and forth or just thinking up witty comebacks.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.540
Nope. Philosophers have all kinds of rhetorical
devices at their disposal that they can use

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.789
to advance an idea, or call into question
the ideas of their interlocutors.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.240
So in order to hold your own in a philosophical
debate, you’re gonna have to know the difference

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.560
between two things that sound like exactly
the same thing: an assertion, and a proposition.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.100
And you’ll need to be able to tell whether
someone actually knows what they’re talking

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.509
about, or if they just believe what they’re
saying might be true.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.749
For example: The sentence I’m saying right
now is an assertion. An assertion is a linguistic

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.450
act – either spoken or written – that
has a truth value. And despite what it might

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.130
sound like, truth value isn’t a measure
of how right something is. It’s just the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.690
state of being either true, or false, or indeterminate.
All declarative sentences have truth values.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.299
Declarations that assert something about the
past or present are either true or false.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.980
And assertions about the future are indeterminate,
at least when they’re expressed, because

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.760
no one knows if they’re right or not yet.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.980
For example, I’m gonna assert that “This cat will pee on my desk before the end of the show.”

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.500
That assertion has a truth value, but it’s
indeterminate, because the show’s not over yet.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.870
We’re just gonna have to wait and see.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.870
Now, all of this contrasts with other kinds of linguistic acts, like questions, which don’t assert anything.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.769
“This is a cat” is an assertion, as opposed
to “Is that a cat?,” which is a linguistic

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.629
act, but not an assertion.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.750
But the substance of what you assert has a
name, too.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.150
The content of your assertion is your proposition.
It’s the underlying meaning of what you’re saying.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.180
So even though an assertion itself can change,
depending on say, what language it’s spoken

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.349
in, its meaning doesn’t change just because
its outer packaging does.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.290
Like, “This is a cat” and “Este es un
gato,” both assert the same proposition.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.930
And a proposition is true if it asserts a
claim that corresponds to reality.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.689
The proposition when I assert “This is a
cat,” is true if the object of the “this”

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.689
is in fact a cat, and false if it is anything
other than a cat. Like, “This is a cat.”

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.790
It’s worth pointing out that attitude counts,
too, when you’re asserting something.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.260
A speaker’s mental state toward the proposition
they’re making is their propositional attitude.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.209
If I say, like, “This is a cat,” but I
actually believe it to be a rat and I’m

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.580
trying to fool you, then philosophers would
say that I have a propositional attitude of disbelief.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.860
Whereas, if I think I’m speaking truthfully,
I have a propositional attitude of belief.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.560
And of course, you’re not going to get very
far as a philosopher unless you understand

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.420
the classic definition of belief itself. Based
on the lingo you’ve learned so far today,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.379
belief is just when you take a propositional
attitude of truth.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.459
I believe that this is a cat, if I think it’s
true – that is, if my attitude is that the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.519
assertion corresponds to reality. And even
if I’m wrong -- even if there were an aardvark

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.359
on my desk, or if there weren’t a cat on
my desk at all, which there isn’t anymore

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.579
-- if I really thought there was a cat on
my desk, that would just be my belief.

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.400
My propositional attitude, in other words,
is what determines if I have a belief.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.560
What all this means is that I, like everyone
else, can have false beliefs. Simply thinking

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.359
something doesn’t make it correspond to
reality, which is what’s needed for truth.

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.569
But of course, the fun of arguing is showing
off what you know to other people, or at least

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.260
producing really clever evidence to support
your case.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.700
So, this raises the question of what it means to actually know something, in the philosophical sense.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.800
The traditional definition of knowledge is
that it’s a justified true belief.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.020
Note that there are three separate components here.

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.280
So, I have knowledge that this is a cat if:
I first believe i’s a cat

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.610
And also that it is in fact a cat – that
is, my belief corresponds to reality and is

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.390
therefore true. And finally, I can be said
to have knowledge about this cat if my belief

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.540
is justified – meaning, I have some sort
of legitimate evidence to support my belief.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.190
Now, we’ve already defined truth and belief.
Justification is simply evidence, or other

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.330
support, for your belief. If you remember
back to episode 2, you’ll recall that premises

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.230
offer justification for conclusions. And justification
can come in a variety of forms. Most often,

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.160
it comes about through testimony – just
taking someone’s word for it. Not all testimony

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.910
is strong, or trustworthy, of course. But
if it comes from someone who’s an expert

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.930
on the topic in question, you might consider
the testimony to be reliable.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.610
And the fact is, most of what you know about
the world, you learned through testimony.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.800
You took your teachers’ word for it when
they were teaching you stuff, and the same

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.020
goes for every book you’ve ever read and
every news report you’ve ever seen. They’re

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.860
all just forms of testimony, which you accepted as justification for your knowledge, and your beliefs.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.280
But justification can come in other forms,
too. Another common type is first person observation

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.610
– information you acquire through your senses.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.660
If I believe that a cat is a cat, because
I already have robust and well-informed beliefs

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.340
about cats, then, having had extensive experience
with them in the past, I’m identifying the

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.010
cat as a cat through my direct contact with
it

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.720
It looks, feels, acts like a cat. Ergo: cat!

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.300
But! Philosophy wouldn’t be any fun if the
key to knowledge were that easy, right?

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.460
Until American philosopher Edmund Gettier
came along in the 1960s, philosophers were

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:01.880
in pretty widespread agreement about the definition
of knowledge -- that it’s justified true belief.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.300
Because, you can believe any old thing, but
in order to know something, it just makes

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.560
sense that you must also have evidence for
your belief, and it must be true. In other

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.430
words, you can have a false belief, but you
can’t have false knowledge. And if something

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:20.090
you thought you knew turns out not to be true, then the fact is, you never actually knew it, you just believed it.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.940
And likewise, you might happen to hold a true belief, but if you don’t have any justification for it, if you

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.140
just accidentally happened to be right, which happens sometimes – that doesn’t count as knowledge, either.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:34.430
Enter Edmund Gettier. Gettier wrote a short
but fabulously influential paper that turned

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.030
the standard understanding of knowledge upside
down.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.550
He did this by proposing what came to be known
as Gettier cases – situations in which one

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.940
can have justified true belief, but not knowledge.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:48.290
Which brings us to this week’s Flash Philosophy!
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.240
Here’s one of Gettier’s original cases.
Smith and Jones have both applied for the same job.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.780
The president of the company told Smith that Jones will get the job. This counts as evidence;

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.500
the president of the company would seem to be a reliable source of this information.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.000
Meanwhile, Smith counts the coins
in Jones’ pocket and sees that there are

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.000
ten coins in there. Smith then forms a belief,
based on his first person observational evidence

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.690
of the coins, as well as the testimony of
the company president.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.560
He comes to believe that: The person who gets
the job has 10 coins in his pocket.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.660
But, it turns out, the testimony of the president
was false, and it’s Smith, not Jones, who gets the job.

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:27.650
AND, it just so happens, unbeknownst to Smith,
that he also has 10 coins in his own pocket.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.060
So, Smith has a belief – that the person
who gets the job has 10 coins in his pocket.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.600
And that is justified – because he counted
Jones’ coins, and the president told him

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.890
Jones was getting the job. And his belief
also turns out to be true – the person who

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.490
got the job did have 10 coins in his pocket.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.900
However, neither pieces of justification actually
pointed Smith to the right answer. The president’s

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.360
testimony was wrong, and the 10 coins that
he saw were in Jones’ pocket, not his own.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.580
So it seems Smith simply lucked into being
right.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.570
Gettier argued that we now have a case of
justified true belief that is not knowledge.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.480
As he pointed out, you don’t KNOW something
if you simply stumbled into the right answer.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.440
Thanks Thought Bubble, the philosophical world
was turned upside down by this idea, and philosophers

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.990
– loving a good counterexample – began
generating their own Gettier cases.

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.550
American philosopher Roderick Chisholm proposed
this one:

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.140
Looking across a field, you see an object
that looks like a sheep, and you form the

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.230
belief that “there is a sheep in the field.”

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.580
It turns out that the object you see is actually
a dog.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.750
Yet, there is also a sheep, obscured from
your vision by a hill.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.700
So, you have a justified true belief, but
the justification for your belief -- the object

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.830
that you saw – is not a sheep. You just
lucked into being right.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:37.199
Once you understand how it works, it’s pretty
easy to generate Gettier cases of your own.

00:08:37.199 --> 00:08:41.979
And many philosophers today think that Gettier successfully destroyed the “justified true belief” definition of knowledge.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:46.199
But even though the 1960s might seem long
ago to you, remember: philosophers are in

00:08:46.199 --> 00:08:50.540
the business of having millennia-long debates
about stuff. So it shouldn’t surprise you

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:53.439
that the philosophical debate about this is
still a-raging.

00:08:53.439 --> 00:08:58.170
But if knowledge is not justified true belief,
then…whaaat is it?

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.389
Next time, we will look at one possible answer.

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:04.379
In the meantime, you learned about some of
the key concepts we use when discussing belief

00:09:04.379 --> 00:09:09.509
and knowledge. You learned what defines an
assertion and a proposition, and that belief

00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:13.730
is a kind of propositional attitude. We also
learned about forms of justification and the

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:19.090
traditional definition of knowledge, which Edmund Gettier just totally messed with, using his Gettier cases.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:24.160
And the cat did not pee on my desk! Because
the cat was unable to spend any time at all

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.509
on my desk. So it turns out the assertion
that I made was false.

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:31.649
