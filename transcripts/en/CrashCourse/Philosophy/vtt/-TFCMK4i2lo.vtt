Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

Squarespace: share your passion with the world.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.040
There’s an ancient Greek legend about a
ship that launched from the port of Theseus,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.440
and sailed around the world.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.580
Probably not around the WHOLE world.
Just AROUND the world.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.160
During its journey, the ship encountered many
dangers.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.300
Storms ravaged its sails, which had to be
replaced.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.840
The floorboards gradually gave way, and had
to be changed out, one by one.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.020
Eventually, crew members decided that they liked the look of some island or another along the way, and stayed behind.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.520
And as the ship sailed on, more and more of
it – and its crew – was replaced,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.960
until finally, not a single original plank
of wood, or hand on deck, remained.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.880
Now here’s the question: When the ship finally returned to Theseus, was it the same ship that left?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.360
The answer – whether we can find it or not
– lies in the concept of identity.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.780
Philosophers describe identity as the relation
that a thing bears only to itself.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.890
So, whatever makes a thing uniquely what it
is defines its identity.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.570
And if two things are identical, they’re
said to share an identity relation.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.619
Now, whether two things are the same might
seem blindingly obvious.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.079
But of course it isn’t.
Because: philosophy.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.460
The philosophy of identity can get pretty slippery, largely because, like the Ship of Theseus, things change.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.079
And when they do, they eventually stop being
what they are, and become something else.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.810
This goes not just for mythological ships,
but for all kinds of things.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.359
Like, this mug can acquire a new identity.
And this money.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.219
And you.
And even … Batman.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:41.720
[Theme Music]

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.360
So, riddle me this:
Is Batman identical to Bruce Wayne?

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.229
And when I say “identical,” I don’t
mean that they just look alike.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.259
I mean that they share the same identity – they’re
literally one and the same.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.069
So, you might think the answer is yes –

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.500
Bruce Wayne and Batman are identical because everyone knows that Bruce Wayne is the man behind the cowl.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.520
Not only that, you might say: Bruce Wayne
is the very essence of Batman.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.300
He saw his parents get killed in that alley.
He became the Dark Knight.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.130
No one else could take his place.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.560
But hold up.
People have taken his place.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.520
It turns out that Dick Grayson, the original
Robin, has pinch-hit for Batman,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.100
donning the cape and cowl to protect the streets
of Gotham in his boss’s absence.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.270
And so has Police Commissioner Jim Gordon.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.260
After Bruce Wayne was reported dead, he reluctantly
accepted the role himself.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.580
Both of those guys have been Batman.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.320
So if the person inside the costume doesn’t
make Batman Batman, then what does?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.100
17th century German philosopher Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz came up with a principle

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.230
that might help us solve the puzzle of Who
Batman Is.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.860
He called it the Indiscernibility of Identicals.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.340
The idea is that, if any two things are identical,
then they must share all the same properties.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.280
If Leibniz is right, then the Ship of Theseus became a new ship as soon as that first plank of wood was replaced.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.920
As soon as its parts were not all original,
then the ship suddenly acquired a new property.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.120
And with a new property came a new identity.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.520
So likewise, Bruce Wayne and Batman can’t be identical, because they have different properties.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.040
Bruce Wayne, for example, has the property of being a millionaire playboy, but Batman doesn’t.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.620
That guy is all business.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.740
Meanwhile, Batman has the property of having
fought the Joker, but Bruce Wayne doesn’t.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.360
And the different versions of Batman aren’t
identical to each other either.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.000
Because the person wearing the costume, even if it’s the exact same costume – which it usually isn’t –

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.580
is going to have different combat techniques,
and even, say, a different moral code.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.960
So, is there a limit to how much something
can change, and still be the same thing?

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.840
Let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for
some Flash Philosophy.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.280
Think about this little puzzler, originally offered by contemporary American philosopher Alan Gibbard.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.320
A sculptor takes a lump of clay, and names
it Lumpl.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.680
She then forms Lumpl into a statue, which
she names Goliath.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.880
Are Lumpl and Goliath identical?

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.060
Our intuition might say yes, because they’re composed of exactly the same amount of the same physical stuff.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.200
It’s been kneaded and molded into a different
shape, but still:

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.470
No part of Lumpl is not Goliath, and no part
of Goliath is not Lumpl.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.870
But consider this: If we wreck the statue, and smush into into a big blob, Goliath is gone,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.180
because part of what it means to be Goliath
is to be shaped like a statue.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.000
But, Lumpl, being a lump, doesn’t have a
set shape.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.100
So it will remain, after Goliath has been
destroyed.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.620
So on one hand, Gibbard observed, Lumpl and
Goliath seem to be identical,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.359
because they’re the same exact thing, just
in different shapes.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.360
But on the other hand, how can Lumpl and Goliath be identical, if one can exist while the other does not?

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.720
Thanks, Thought Bubble! One way to try and make sense of identity, and explain how an object endures over time,

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.389
is by making a distinction between what we
call essential and accidental properties.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.709
Essential properties are the core elements
needed for a thing to be the thing that it is.

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:45.389
Accidental properties are traits that could be taken away from an object without making it a different thing.

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.349
Think about a dog.
A dog without a tail is still a dog.

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.189
Give him a shave, or a silly poodle doo, don’t
let it bark – you still have a dog.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.669
So all those things are all accidental properties,
and they’re pretty easy to pick out.

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.919
But it can be really tough to find its essential
properties, the things that,

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.879
if they were absent,
would make the dog not a dog anymore.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.020
And the more something changes, the harder
it can be to determine its identity.

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:09.389
A tree can lose its leaves and still be a
tree.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.220
But if you cut the tree up and make it into
a bunch of notebooks, is it still a tree?

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.460
And if you think a notebook is not a tree, then at what point in the process did the tree lose its tree-ness?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.080
Was it when it was cut down, and thus no longer
living?

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.840
Maybe.
But isn’t a dead tree still a tree?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.620
Or did it happen when the dead tree was cut
into pieces, and was lying on the ground?

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:29.999
Did it make a difference when those pieces
were collected?

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.960
How about when they were ground up into pulp?

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.380
The tree stopped being a tree when its essential
property was lost.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.600
But when exactly that happened depends on
your perspective.

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.150
Plus, many thinkers reject the concept of
essential properties altogether.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.110
Existentialists, for example, deny the very
existence of essential properties.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.370
And ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus famously said that you can’t step in the same river twice.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.720
What he meant was: Nothing is identical to
itself because everything

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.089
– including both you and the river –
is changing all the time.

00:05:57.089 --> 00:06:00.329
So not only is the Ship of Theseus a new ship
by the time it gets to Theseus,

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:03.091
but it was a new ship the first time anything
about it changed!

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.340
Now, it’s amusing enough to think about
whether ships and trees endure over time,

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.849
or what makes Batman Batman.

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.729
But, ultimately, why should you care? How
does this affect your life?

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.099
Well, if objects are important to you,

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.559
then you’ll want to know whether you have
the same object that you think you have.

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:22.930
And, when it comes to tangible stuff, we tend
to value persistent identity.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.689
If you take $20 out of my wallet to buy lunch
and then stop at an ATM and replace it,

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.289
is the money you gave me identical to what
I had this morning?

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.900
If Nick breaks my favorite coffee mug here, and replaces it with a new one and I can’t tell the difference,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.389
do I still have the same mug I started with?

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.080
What if your dog runs away while I’m house-sitting
for you,

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.629
and I replace your dog with a new dog so similar
that you can’t tell? Is it the same dog?

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:50.189
What’s the difference between the money
and the cups and the dogs?

00:06:50.189 --> 00:06:55.059
Philosophers actually have a word that explains
why we think one $20 bill is the same as another,

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:58.539
but one corgi isn’t the same as her cosmetically
identical sister.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.300
It’s fungibility – the property of being interchangeable with other objects of the same kind.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.220
Most people think that money is fungible, because it’s just a place-holder for the value it represents –

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.389
and it’s the value that we really care about.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.680
As long as there’s a $20 bill in my wallet
to buy me some nice Thai drunken noodles,

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.550
I really don’t care whether it’s the same
one I put there or not –

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.499
although I would like to know why you’re
digging around in my wallet.

00:07:19.499 --> 00:07:21.979
Now the coffee mug … this one is interesting.

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.719
It seems like what matters here is why that
mug that Nick broke was my favorite.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.820
If I loved it because it’s the perfect size and shape to fit in my hands, and it keeps my coffee warm,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.060
then I’d probably be just as happy with
a new one.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:34.940
So in that case, the mug appears to be fungible.

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.339
But if I love the mug for personal reasons –

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:42.060
like, say it was the first Crash Course Philosophy mug ever manufactured, or it was a gift from my Dad.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.640
Then a new one, even if it’s cosmetically the same, wouldn’t mean the same thing to me.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:52.120
Because it might be that what I care about isn’t the mug at all, but some sort of abstract idea behind the mug –

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:55.869
like my love for Crash Course, or the connection
between Dad and me.

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:59.850
In any case, I gotta ask, Nick just be more
careful when you’re around my stuff.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.539
Today we’ve learned about different ways
of understanding identity –

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:07.499
including the Indiscernibility of Identicals,
and essential and accidental properties.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:13.580
We thought about how change does and doesn’t affect identity, and what it means for a thing to persist over time.

00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:18.580
And next time, we’re going to take what we’ve learned about identity, and apply it to personal identity –

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.480
thinking about what connects this guy to me.
