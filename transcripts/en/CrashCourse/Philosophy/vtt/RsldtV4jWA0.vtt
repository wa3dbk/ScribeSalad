00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.000
We’re living in a world of Black Lives Matter
versus All Lives Matter.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.280
A world where presidential elections hinge on
people’s views regarding the building of walls.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:21.580
And we should be open about the fact that issues like these – ones that involve our beliefs about sameness, equality, and difference – are sensitive, and can easily arouse our emotions.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.039
One topic that always comes up in these conversations
is discrimination.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.680
It’s one of those loaded words, packed with
negativity.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.640
Most people would probably tell you that discrimination
is bad.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.660
But, they probably do it, whether they realize
it or not.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.540
So, are they allowed to, morally speaking?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.200
And do you do it?
How can you tell if you do?

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.400
Are there times when it’s OK to discriminate?
Maybe even necessary?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.330
When you answer questions like these, it can
be hard to keep emotions from taking over.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:56.890
So, it’s worth taking some time here, when our emotions are at an even-keel, and Reason is in the driver’s seat – right where Plato said it belongs – to think carefully about discrimination, and what it really means.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:07.230
[Theme Music]

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.700
Morality demands that individuals, acts, or states of affairs that are the same should be treated the same.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.020
But we don’t always do that.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:22.300
Discrimination is the favoring of one group – or member of a group – over another group, or other member of it, in the absence of any morally relevant differences.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.100
Morally relevant differences are things that
would actually justify unequal treatment.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.500
Like, if you work for an airline and you’re hiring a pilot, you can favor a person with sight over a blind person, because when the job is flying a plane, sight matters.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.100
You’re not discriminating against a blind person because they’re blind, but because they are literally unable to do the job.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.240
And someone who looks like me would be a fairly awful candidate to go undercover with, like, the Haitian mafia, which means skin color can matter – although very rarely.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.020
So there are cases where we can see clear justifications for favoring members of one group over another.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.479
And there are plenty of equally obvious cases
where favoritism seems clearly unjustified.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.710
But what about the not-so clear-cut cases?

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.660
What if there really are reasons why you might want to discriminate, but those reasons are relevant in one instance, and not another?

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.420
So let’s look at some tough cases.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:18.320
Contemporary Australian philosopher Peter Singer offers the example of a restaurant owner who doesn’t want to hire an African American because his clientele is racist.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.160
He’s afraid that many of his customers will stop coming to his restaurant rather than be served by an African American.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.340
So the restaurant owner himself doesn’t hold racist beliefs, but he worries the decision to be “color-blind” in hiring will harm his livelihood.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.320
It might make us uncomfortable to admit, but in certain parts of the country, this restaurant owner’s concerns are not at all unfounded.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.020
Or consider a woman who refuses to be treated by a highly qualified gynecologist, simply because he’s male.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.980
Now, what about a woman who refuses to be treated by a qualified gynecologist because he’s Asian-American?

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.720
Or say there’s an all-male company that hires a qualified woman over an equally qualified man, in the interest of fostering diversity in the workplace.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.030
Or a bakery that refuses to make a Nazi-themed
cake for a customer who’s a white supremacist?

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.400
Some of these cases you probably agree with,
some of them you probably don’t.

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.590
Your gut intuition might be to applaud the
bakery for refusing to make a Nazi cake.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.850
But think about their reasons for turning down that job – probably a deep personal conviction that Nazi ideology is appalling, so they don’t want to contribute to its endorsement and celebration.

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.520
But what if instead of a Nazi cake, it was
a wedding cake for a same-sex couple?

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.460
And what if the owners of the bakery have a deep personal conviction that same sex marriage is appalling and they don’t want to contribute to its endorsement and celebration?

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.140
Do you support their refusal too?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.270
Now, you might hold the view that we should
all have the freedom to do whatever we want.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.260
Business owners can discriminate because of their personal convictions, or to maximize profits, or just because they’re straight-up racists.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.260
The problem with this view is that it gives
a great deal of freedom to only some people

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.650
– namely, those in power, those who own
the businesses and control the money.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.780
And the more freedom they have to act as they choose, the less freedom the people they’re discriminating against will have.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.800
So if we actually want a country that’s free for all of its citizens, the freedom to act against some of our citizens is going to have to be held in check.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.860
And that means reining in the freedom to discriminate.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.360
Now, there’s obviously a lot of disagreement about when discrimination is ok and when it’s not.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.380
Contemporary American philosopher Judith Jarvis
Thomson offers this rule of thumb:

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:22.620
Discrimination that favors a historically underprivileged class is more likely to be acceptable than discrimination that favors a historically privileged class.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.820
The reasoning, she says, is that those who have historically been denied privilege could use the advantage.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.400
So if a woman is getting hired over a man, well, that’s not a big deal, considering that men have been hired over women so many times in the past.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:45.580
As long as a historically underprivileged group continues to suffer from the disadvantages of the past – even if those disadvantages are not currently being imposed on them – Jarvis Thomson says a little special treatment is OK.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.431
Not everyone agrees with this view, however.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.100
Like contemporary American philosopher Robert
Nozick, who we talked about last time.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.400
After all, what if I happen to be a member
of a historically privileged class?

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.499
That’s not my fault.

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:59.960
So why should I have to be passed over for
jobs because of my gender and my pale skin?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.460
Isn’t that also unjustified discrimination?

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.920
One response to Nozick is to argue that justice
isn’t always the same as being fair.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.980
If I’m a white guy passed over for a job that
I’m qualified for, that sucks, and it’s unfair.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.800
But the reason it feels unfair to me now is because I’ve reaped the spoils of white male privilege for so long.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:23.400
When you’re already so far ahead, it can feel really bad to be held back and asked to wait for others to catch up.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.000
But if we’re actually aiming at equality, that’s exactly what the people at the front are going to have to do

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.280
Now let’s go back to the gynecologist cases.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.499
Many people’s intuition is that women should
be able to choose against male gynecologists,

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.840
because being examined by a man in such an
intimate way might make a woman feel uncomfortable.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.680
Yet, many people might report the same level of discomfort being examined by someone of another race.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:51.380
These cases tug at the feelings we have about our personal beliefs, and what happens when those private things butt up against the public sphere.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:58.220
You might think that every individual should be free to choose – and choose against – doctors for whatever personal reasons she might have.

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.849
But, we should also consider what these discriminatory
mindsets are really based on.

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:12.040
The reason customers might not want an African American to bring food to their table is the same reason that a patient might not want to be examined by an Asian-American doctor – fear of the unknown.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.440
But we know, intellectually, that these fears
are unfounded.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.160
Spend some time around people who are different
from you in a way that makes you uncomfortable,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.659
and you realize that, despite those differences, there are actually a lot more similarities than there are differences.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.480
So, the restaurant owner from Case #1 could allow his patrons to decide who they’ll be served by, and not give the African American applicant the job.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.860
Or, he can say, this is my new employee, so if you want to eat here, you’re going to have to get over yourself and your racism.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:45.500
And this might cost him some business, but, over time, his customers will get over themselves and probably be a little more accepting of other races as well.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.080
Which is exactly what happened, by and large, when racial discrimination in hiring became illegal.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:55.480
It might seem unfair that a small business
owner should have to take on that fight, though.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.680
Why is it his job to educate his racist clientele?

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.080
Likewise when it comes to discriminating against
customers, or job applicants.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.779
Is there a difference between a business being able to choose who they do or don’t hire, and who they do and don’t serve?

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:14.240
How do we balance this right – if it is one –
against a person’s right to be employed, and served?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.560
One response is to say that people have a
negative right to employment, and to service

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.030
– that is, people can’t be stopped from
obtaining those things.

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.070
But that does not entail a corresponding right
to this job, or to be served at this business.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.860
Like, we don’t all have a right to any particular
job.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.680
And similarly, businesses don’t have to
serve everyone.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.320
You don’t have a right to tickets to a sold
out concert.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:41.240
And if there’s still a line at the ice cream stand when closing time rolls around, the business has a right to turn customers away.

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:45.549
So it seems like it matters why you’re being
denied the job or service.

00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:48.829
Is there a morally relevant reason for the
discrimination?

00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:50.240
Think back through the cases.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:55.140
After reflecting on what we’ve talked about today,
has your response to any of those cases changed?

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.380
And if so, why?

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.289
It’s an issue that deserves your thought.

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:03.180
And if you share those thoughts in the comments,
please do so as kindly and thoughtfully as possible.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.220
Today we learned about discrimination.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.440
We talked through several hard cases, and
explored our responses to them.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.800
We considered the views that everyone should
be free to discriminate if they want to,

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.210
that it’s never ok to discriminate in any
case,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.400
or that discrimination should occur when it’s done to advantage a historically underprivileged group.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.759
Next time, we’re going to talk about our
moral obligations regarding animals.

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:29.469
