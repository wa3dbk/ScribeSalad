Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.960
Squarespace: share your passion with the world.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.480
Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that
you love your father.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.390
By which I mean, you want him to be alive.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.920
And let’s also assume that you don’t have any attachments to your mother that you might describe as... romantic.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.840
Well, guess who thought felt the same way about his parents? Oedipus.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.620
According to ancient Greek legend, when Oedipus
was born,

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.990
a prophecy foretold that he would kill his
father and marry his mother.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.510
So his father left baby Oedipus in the wilderness,
assuming he would die,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.700
and the prophecy would then not come true.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.150
But instead, the abandoned baby was discovered
and raised by another family.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.330
As an adult, Oedipus learned of the prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.930
So, not knowing he was adopted, he left his adoptive parents in order to avoid fulfilling that prophecy,

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.400
figuring that if he wasn’t near them, it
couldn’t come true.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.100
Lo and behold, as he was trying to flee his fate, Oedipus killed a stranger in a fit of rage,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.079
who turned out to be the father he had never
met.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:04.550
He then proceeded to marry the dead man’s
widow,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.470
who was actually his mother, though he didn’t
know it.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.880
Needless to say, this is a fate that, needless to say, any of us would like to avoid.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.900
But for philosophers, the whole point of the story of Oedipus is: there is no escaping fate.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:27.560
[Theme Music]

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.900
Are we free?

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.260
I mean, on the one hand, most of us have the
clear sense that we are.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.260
We feel free.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.300
We feel like we make all sorts of decisions that lead to both beliefs and actions that are wholly of our own choosing.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.570
Like, I could do that.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.140
I had oatmeal this morning because I felt
like it.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.780
This view – that humans are capable of entirely free actions – is known as libertarian free will.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
And to be clear, libertarian free will is
nothing like political libertarianism.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980
Both views get their name from the word liberty,

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.480
but political libertarians are all about freedom
from government intervention,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.480
while people who accept libertarian free will could be anything from political libertarians to socialists.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.180
They just think that, metaphysically, we can
act freely.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.890
So a lot of us figure that our thoughts and
actions are free.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.760
But, most of us also believe that every effect
has a cause,

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.060
And that everything that happens now, in the
present,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.020
is the necessary result of events that occurred
in the past.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.390
This view is known as hard determinism.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.910
And many of the people watching this probably
think that they believe in both things;

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.430
that many of your actions are free, and that
the world is governed by cause and effect.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.050
But, it turns out, you can’t rationally
hold both views.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.840
Because, traditionally, libertarians have defined free actions according to what’s known as the Principle of Alternate Possibilities.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.410
That might sound like the plot device for
a sci-fi show,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.390
but this principle says that an action is
free only if the agent

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.590
– that is, the person doing the thing –
could have done otherwise.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.190
So, truly free actions require options.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.340
Determinism, by contrast, doesn’t allow
options.

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.900
It holds that every event is caused by a previous
event.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.959
Which means that an agent can never have done
anything other than what they did,

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.730
and therefore, they are never free.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.900
But let’s look at these two options more
closely.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.660
And also, let’s look at my breakfast.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.040
Libertarianism says that my decision to eat
oatmeal this morning

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.820
wasn’t necessarily caused by anything that
happened before it.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.680
Instead, it could have been the result of
non-physical events

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.570
– specifically, my own thoughts –
that originated right at that point.

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.380
I ate oatmeal because I decided to eat oatmeal!

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.489
End of story.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.529
But libertarianism runs counter to what we
know about the workings of the physical world,

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:30.120
with one thing causing another.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.160
So libertarians need a way to account for
their view.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.440
One way they do that is by making a distinction between what’s known as event causation, and agent causation.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.640
Event causation means that no physical event can occur without having been caused by a previous physical event.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.800
So, many libertarians concede that the physical
world itself is deterministic.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.270
Like, a baseball is flying through the air
because someone hit that ball with a bat.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.580
But many libertarians also argue that there’s
such a thing as agent causation,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.879
which says that an agent
– a being propelled by a mind –

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.610
can start a whole chain of causality that
wasn’t caused by anything else.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.209
So, the person who hit the ball most likely
did so because they just decided to do it.

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.269
By this logic, agents have the ability to
affect the causal chain of the universe.

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.189
They can make stuff happen on their own.

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:16.269
But, many philosophers find this idea untenable.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.820
Where would these free decisions, the ones that launch entirely new causal chains, come from, they ask?

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.240
Are they simply random?

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.270
What would compel an agent to make one decision,
and not another?

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.320
And if you can answer those questions – if you can explain what would cause an agent to act –

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.910
Then well, you’ve just reinforced the position
that actions are caused, rather than free.

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.070
The fact is, it’s pretty difficult to find
arguments that support libertarian free will.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.320
The best argument in favor of it seems to be that it just feels an awful lot like we’re free.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.699
And libertarians argue that we shouldn’t discount the legitimacy of our own personal, subjective experiences –

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:52.959
so if we feel so free, we should seriously
consider the possibility that we are.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.940
That point has a certain intuitive appeal.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.840
But if you can’t come up with an argument
to defend your feeling,

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.920
then good philosophical reasoning recommends
that you reject it,

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.780
or at least withhold judgment until you can
get some evidence together.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.790
So now let’s see if the hard determinists
can do any better.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:11.740
18th century French philosopher Baron D’Holbach said that none of our actions are actually free.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.140
D’Holbach believed that everything that’s happening right now is the result of an unbroken chain of events.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.860
Everything, he said, is the inevitable result
of what came before.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.820
Including everything that we do!

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.800
Our actions are caused in the same way that, say, home runs are caused by bats hitting balls,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.780
or tornadoes are caused by warm air systems
hitting cool air systems in the right conditions.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.220
This means that humans and our actions are just part of the physical world, bound by its physical laws.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.500
This belief is often explained through a view
known as reductionism.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.120
Reductionism is the view that all parts of
the world, and of our own experience,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.680
can be traced back – or reduced down – to
one singular thing.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.840
So, for example, you see your mind as being
capable of making free decisions.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.820
You think that what goes on in your head when you make a choice is not at all like bats and balls.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.700
But, well, mental states are brain states,
or at least they’re tied directly to your brain.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.580
And brain states are biological.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.840
And biological states are physical states.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:08.140
And the physical world – as we already said
– is deterministic.

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.720
There’s just no room for free will in this
picture.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.150
We think we’re free - but we’re not.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.280
And really, as scientific thinkers, why would
we assume that we are?

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.760
Why would we think that we’re any different
than everything else in the universe?

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.660
What would make us so special?

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.780
Libertarians are right that it’s really
hard to disregard the feeling of freedom.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.620
If I didn’t choose to eat oatmeal this morning,
why do I feel like I did?

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:30.979
And what made me do it?

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.280
But hard determinists say that the difference
between the causes of human actions

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.170
and the causes of physical events
– like a bat hitting a ball –

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.150
is that our actions have all sorts of invisible
causes that happen in our brains.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:48.200
Specifically, when beliefs team up with our desires and our temperament, they say, you get a deliberate human action.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.380
Combine my belief that oatmeal is nutritious,
with my desire for healthy nourishment,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.240
and the temperament that predisposes me to
enjoy warm, carby comfort foods,

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.480
and ta-da! – you get oatmealy breakfast!

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.850
Now, you might argue that those particular
beliefs, desires, and temperaments

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.690
might lead to any number of breakfast choices
– cream of wheat, maybe, or some granola.

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.810
But, if you dig deep enough, you’d see that
there are factors that rule out those options

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.550
– as well as every other option.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.140
Maybe I’m a little worried about one of
my fillings coming loose,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.680
so I’m shying away from the granola because
it’s too crunchy.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.140
Or I just don’t think about cream of wheat
very often.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.380
I mean, they don’t have very good brand
awareness anymore.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.759
What even is cream of wheat exactly?

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:25.910
And the oatmeal is sitting right there in
front of me.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.340
Or maybe I think briefly of making one of those quinoa breakfast bowls that are so hip right now.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.500
But my lazy temperament, or my belief that
I’m running late,

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.720
pushes me to choose the 90-seconds-in-the-microwave
option.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720
See how it works?

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.550
All you have to do is change one factor

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.410
– a belief, desire, or temperament –
and you’ll get a different outcome.

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.280
Hard determinists argue that, just because
we can’t pinpoint the exact factors that

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:48.500
led us to an action, we could, in theory isolate
them –

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.060
if we knew enough about all the beliefs, desires,
and temperaments swirling around in our brains.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.940
So, in this view, what we call “decisions” are really just the inevitable results of a bunch of mental stuff combining in just the right way.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.500
And maybe it feels free.
But it’s not.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.840
But hold up!
Isn’t there some way out of this?

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.960
Like, what if I have someone choose my breakfast
for me?

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.870
Or what if I fall back on randomness, by,
like, flipping a coin?

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:14.030
After all, if I just flipped a coin, then it wouldn’t look like that decision was made by beliefs, desires, and temperaments.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.830
But, well, no such luck.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.349
Because even if I thought I chose randomly,
my decision to flip the coin,

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:22.940
or who I asked to pick for me, was just as
determined as everything else.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.940
And guess what!

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.100
If you’re getting angry right now about
me telling you none of your choices are free,

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.380
well, that anger was determined!

00:08:29.389 --> 00:08:33.570
If you’re finding this whole topic confusing,
or boring yep – still determined.

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.849
You think you can just freely choose to stop
playing this video, but if you’re still

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:39.969
watching me, good news: that’s determined
too!

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:44.880
Determinists believe that you can’t help but feel and react the way you’re reacting right now.

00:08:44.889 --> 00:08:48.360
You can think you’re choosing to act in
ways that conform to the character that you’ve

00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:52.440
selected and shaped for yourself, but even
that “choice” is the result of all sorts

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.980
of already-determined factors about you and
your place in the world.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.879
Hard determinism is tough to refute.

00:08:57.879 --> 00:09:00.100
And it has some really uncomfortable implications.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.760
It means the deeply held feeling most of us
have that we actually make free decisions?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.060
Is just wrong.

00:09:06.069 --> 00:09:09.759
And the whole concept of personal responsibility
is thrown out the window, too.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:13.149
As D’Holbach put it, we’re all just “cogs
in a machine,”

00:09:13.149 --> 00:09:17.029
doing what we were always meant to do, with
no actual volition.

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:20.449
Oedipus had to kill his dad and marry his
mom.

00:09:20.449 --> 00:09:22.170
I had to eat the oatmeal.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.720
And you? You just had to keep watching!
You couldn’t turn away!

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:30.800
Today we learned about libertarian free will
and it’s counterpoint, hard determinism.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.720
Next time, we’ll see if some middle ground can be found between determinism and libertarianism.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.580
And I sure hope there can be.
