Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.080
Squarespace: Share your passion with the world.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.020
We’ve spent a couple of lessons thinking
about how philosophers reason.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.820
Now it’s time to do some actual philosophy.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.600
And one of the most important hallmarks
of philosophical thought is that

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.980
you should never take things at face value.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
You should always be willing to accept that
there’s more to the world than meets the eye.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.480
Because, whatever truth seems obvious today,
might turn out to be not so true at all.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.950
It’s one of the more daunting pursuits in
philosophy -- pondering what’s really real,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.820
as opposed to what you think is real, and
how you could ever know the difference.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.580
Fortunately, there are some guides who can help you on your journey, when you’re exploring the nature of reality.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.220
And you know who’s really helpful here?
Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.480
I mean, I guess you could say that a lot actors can transport you to another reality if they’re good enough.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.720
But that’s not what I mean.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.859
I’m talking about Inception, that movie
where Leo plays a thief who steals ideas from

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.819
people by invading their dreams.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.239
A super-handy ability if you want to, say, steal corporate secrets from a CEO, or military plans from a head of state.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.230
But after a while, it becomes hard for some
members of Leo’s team to tell the difference

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.100
between one dream and another, or to discern
dreams from reality.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.140
The whole film is populated with people who live
in a dream world, convinced they’re living real-life.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.640
To them, the dream is all there is – it
has become their reality.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.180
But from the perspective of those outside
the dream, who see their sleeping bodies,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.290
the reality they’re chasing is simply false.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.170
It’s a real cool premise for a movie. I
haven’t ruined it for you -- you can still

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.160
watch it. And the fact is, the same concept
has been around for thousands of years.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.420
The basic question that Inception asks has
vexed philosophers all the way back to the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.320
very roots of Western philosophy.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.360
Is it possible that my current reality isn’t
real at all?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.960
Before we had Leonardo DiCaprio to walk us
through this question we had Plato.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:54.400
[Theme Music]

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.520
Around 2400 years ago, Plato wrote his famous
book, The Republic, in which he describes

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.560
-- probably better than anyone before or since
-- the nature of reality.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.840
He does it by telling a story about prisoners who have been chained since birth in a dark cave, facing a blank wall.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.829
All kinds of people and objects pass behind
the prisoners, and a fire casts the shadows

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.739
of those things onto the wall in front of
the prisoners.

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.539
These shadow images are all the prisoners ever see, and they come to understand the shadows as reality.

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.140
Now just hold up a minute and imagine what
your view of the world would be like, if all

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.320
you’ve ever seen are shadows. You wouldn’t
know that there was anything more.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.780
3D wouldn’t even be a concept for you.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.290
The prisoners spend their whole lives understanding
only this shadow reality, until one day one

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.689
of them escapes from his chains, and crawls
into the daylight.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.150
After spending a lifetime in fire-lit darkness,
the man is blinded by the sun at first.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.930
But in time, he comes to see the things outside
the cave are far more real than the shadow

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.999
images that he once took for reality.

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:54.060
They have substance. They occupy an extra
dimension.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.819
Think about how that would feel. To suddenly
realize that everything you believed just

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.579
minutes ago turned out to be merely faint
outlines of reality.

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.999
This is what happens to a lot of the
characters who inhabit the world of Inception:

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.260
Once they realize there can be multiple layers of reality, they never look at the world around them the same way again.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.300
And for many of them, the
experience becomes intoxicating.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.870
This is also what happens to Plato’s escaped
prisoner.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.430
He goes back into the cave to tell his friends
the exciting news about what he’s found.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.760
But the conversation doesn’t go the way
he thinks it will.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.129
He expects them to be amazed by his discovery
-- he figures they’ll be as eager to join

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.180
him as he is anxious to get back.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.029
But they all think he’s crazy. As far as
they’re concerned, he’s babbling about

00:03:32.029 --> 00:03:36.930
some “higher reality” that they’ve never
seen, or heard of, or have any evidence for.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.450
To make matters worse, going back into the
fire-lit cave, after being in the sunlight,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.170
temporarily blinds the man again.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.040
So, from his friends’ perspective, his journey
into the outside world has actually damaged him,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.020
because now he can’t even see the shadow
images that were once his whole world.

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:53.659
Now, you don’t have to be Plato, or Christopher
Nolan, to dream this stuff up.

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:58.279
In fact, you might have experienced a diluted
version of this kind of reality-shock for yourself.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.519
For example:
Do you remember your first teddy bear?

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.139
That bear was, philosophically speaking,
your only contact with,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.320
and your only way of understanding,
the concept of a bear.

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:12.609
Then one day, you went to a zoo, or a wildlife refuge,
or a national park, and you saw an actual bear.

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.849
And suddenly you realized that your previous
understanding of ‘bear’ was way, way off.

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:22.260
Bears don’t have button eyes and little smiles made
of thread. They’re not soft. You couldn’t hug one.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.700
The bear you spent your first years of life
snuggling with, was just a shadowy imitation

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.540
of the reality of bear-ness.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.420
Now, check out this somewhat more mature example:

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.060
Maybe you were the first member of your tweeny
group of friends to discover the wonders of

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.040
romantic attraction. You might’ve felt like
your eyes were open to a whole new world that

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.890
your pals were still blind to.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.950
And when you tried to explain to them what
had happened to you? And how you felt?

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.850
They probably thought you were crazy. And
the feeling was probably mutual.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.580
And this is what our poor protagonist goes
through when he re-enters the cave.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.310
So why does Plato tell us this story?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.970
It’s not just about little a-ha moments,
like when we discovered that bears and boys

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.050
were not what we once thought they were. It’s
more than that.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.830
Plato wants us to see that we, right now,
are prisoners in a cave.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.260
Everything in our world is actually a mere
shadow of a higher reality.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.030
Just as the man in the story once mistook
shadows for real things, we are currently

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.920
prisoners in a cave of our own.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.130
But rather than mistaking shadows for the
material objects of the ordinary world, our

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.330
mistake is thinking that the material objects
of the ordinary world are the most real things.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.830
In fact, Plato says, the physical world that we think is the most real, is actually a mere shadow of a higher truth.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.980
If this surprises you, think about how many
beliefs were once accepted as absolute fact

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.230
– only to later turn out to be completely
false –

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.570
The shape of the earth. The idea that the
Earth was the center of the universe.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.970
The belief that heroin, and tobacco, and lobotomies
were good for people.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.380
Those so-called facts turned out to be far
from the truth.

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.710
So, there’s a lot packed into this little
story.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.230
Plato is urging you to consider that the
world is not really as it seems.

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.490
And making a statement about philosophy.
Doing philosophy is hard.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.630
Accepting that much of what you’ve always believed might actually be false can make you uncomfortable.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.500
You might feel temporarily blinded.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.260
You may learn just enough to know that your
old beliefs aren’t reliable, but you don’t

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.050
yet know enough to feel comfortable with these
new ideas, either.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.220
What’s more, your old friends, who aren’t on this journey with you, might think you’ve lost your mind.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.360
Or they might take you for an arrogant, pedantic
jerk who thinks they have all the answers.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.230
But philosophy is also awesome.

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.620
Because, once you get through the growing
pains, you can see things in a new way, and

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.860
you can see through things that used to fool
you.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.420
And that brings us to another puzzle. Consider
this argument:

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.060
No cat has 2 tails. Every cat has one more
tail than no cat. Therefore, every cat has 3 tails.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.980
Now, you’re probably thinking, that’s just
clearly wrong. That’s not much of a puzzle.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.950
I mean, the two premises sound right enough.
But the conclusion is … wha?

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.220
This puzzle exploits a strangeness in the
language that we use to discuss certain ideas

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.000
-- specifically the ideas of nothingness,
absence, or emptiness.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.440
In premise 1, ‘no cat’ refers to an absence
of cats.

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.270
Think about things with 2 tails, and none
of those things you think of are cats. Because

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.840
you probably can’t even think of anything
with two tails.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.440
But in premise 2, the language tricks us into
understanding ‘No-Cat’ as an existent thing,

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.980
rather than an absence of a thing.
The way it’s phrased, No-Cat could conceivably

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.830
be that elusive creature that has 2 tails.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.460
So this leads us to the conclusion that, if
the No-Cat has 2 tails, and every cat has

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:21.040
one more tail than it does, then every cat
must have 3 tails! Which is just wrong.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.720
And it takes a moment to understand the source
of our confusion.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.560
The conclusion is faulty, because it mistakes the absence of something for the presence of something.

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.960
But it strikes us as plausible, on some level,
because language has duped us into considering

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.200
a reality where a creature called No Cat with
two tails is actually a thing.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:41.220
Figuring out puzzles like this is kind of
like flipping a switch -- first you’re confused,

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.400
and then the cause of the confusion seems
obvious.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.140
It’s just a matter of sorting through what’s
really real.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.720
And Plato thinks philosophy is like that too
-- going from the darkness into the light

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.700
is both disorienting and rewarding.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.610
It’s kinda too bad in this case, though.
Because: a cat with three tails? I’d kind

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:58.610
of like to see that. Though, to be honest
I’d mostly just like looking at any cat.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.750
And with that, we wrap up this episode of
Crash Course Philosophy. Today we learned

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.890
about Plato’s famous Myth of the Cave, questioned
the relationship between appearance and reality,

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.590
and talked about the process of philosophical
discovery.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:14.250
Next time, we’re going to disappear even
deeper into the hole of shadow and disbelief

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.890
– all in the hopes of eventually emerging
into the light.
