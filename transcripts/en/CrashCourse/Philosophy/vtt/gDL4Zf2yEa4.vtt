00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.680
At a museum in Denmark in 2000, artist Marco Evaristti debuted a work of art that involved live goldfish swimming around in vessels full of water.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.440
Sound pretty boring until I tell you that
those vessels were electric blenders.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.580
Evaristti named his display “Helena” and he invited museum patrons to turn on the blenders if they so desired.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.240
Eventually, at least one person so desired, fish were blended, and before long police arrived, ordering that the blenders be unplugged.

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:41.420
The museum was charged with animal cruelty,
although those charges were later dropped.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.480
For his part, Evaristti said that his work
was designed to sort people into three categories:

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.080
If you want to push the button, he said, you’re
a sadist;

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.050
if the exhibit makes you feel upset, you’re
a moralist;

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.349
and if you enjoy watching the reactions of
others, you’re a voyeur.

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:59.109
But many people argued that Evaristti’s
goldfish blenders weren’t art at all.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.100
You probably have your own opinions about
that.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:09.320
But no matter what you think, works like Evaristti’s raise a lot of questions – about art and morality, and what standards we should use to evaluate art.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.820
And from there, new questions follow: like,
what does art tell us about ourselves?

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.400
What does it do to us, and what purpose does
art serve in our lives?

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:28.700
[Theme Music]

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.800
You know who was super anti-art?
Plato.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.560
He believed that art plays to our emotions
rather than to our reason.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.820
And, if you recall Plato’s idea of the tripartite soul, he thought the rational part of the soul should always be in charge.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.240
So, art was problematic for him, because it encourages us to think with the spirited, or emotional, part of our souls.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.660
He also had a beef with art because, he said,
it depicts the imaginary as if it were real.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.580
And for a guy who was as concerned with Truth as he was, you can see why this might have been a problem.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.700
Plato was so concerned about the dangers of art that he actually advocated its widespread censorship.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.780
And, while you might disagree with him on that, you can probably at least agree with his sentiment that art is powerful.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.520
But…what is it good for?

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.440
Well, let’s fast forward about 2400 years
for that.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.560
20th century British philosopher R.G. Collingwood acknowledged that art is frequently used as an escape from life – a simple amusement, a distraction.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.840
But he also said that the best art, the art that really matters, is the stuff that changes the way we interact with the world.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.620
So Collingwood drew a distinction between
what he called amusement art and magic art.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.920
Amusement art helps the audience escape from reality, he said – diving into a no-stakes fictional world after a stressful day.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.700
But magic art is the stuff that helps the audience learn how better to interact with this world’s reality.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.450
A great example of this is Harriet Beecher
Stowe’s novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.860
Beecher Stowe’s story helped change our national mindset about slavery,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.500
by making white readers see African Americans as human beings with whom they had a lot in common,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.060
rather than as a nameless Other who should
be thought of as property.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:08.100
Collingwood felt we should spend our time on magic art like that – the stuff that helps us live better, rather than simply running away from the world.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.040
But some people feel that his distinction
breaks down pretty quickly.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.500
A book or a movie that could be little more than an amusing escape for one person could spur another person to change their lives for the better.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.879
Think about your favorite fandom.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.200
Like, for some people, Harry Potter is pure escapism – a way to disappear into a fantasy where your troubles can be addressed with the flick of a wand.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.870
But for others, Harry Potter can help you
learn how to live.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.100
Lessons on the value of friendship, teamwork, loyalty, and stick-with-it-ness can be found among the horcruxes and Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.579
So, art can help you be moral, or maybe encourage immorality, but there are plenty of other ways in which morality can intersect with art.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.179
Like in nasty, legal, copyright-y ways.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.820
For more on this, let’s head to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:58.140
In 2011, wildlife photographer David Slater was on a photo shoot in Indonesia, when a monkey named Naruto got a hold of his camera.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.420
There are disputes as to how, exactly.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.640
But in the process, that monkey took some
pretty sweet selfies.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.100
Slater later tried to claim copyright of the images, but was denied, because he was not the one who took the pictures – Naruto did.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.660
The photos are currently in the public domain, but the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a lawsuit on behalf of Naruto,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.360
arguing that the monkey owns the rights, and any profits ought to go to him.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:30.260
Slater, on the other hand, says he should own the rights, because he was ultimately responsible for Naruto getting his camera and taking the pictures with it.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.760
By that logic, Slater claims, he was the artist, and Naruto was simply part of the medium used to create the art.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.720
Slater’s reasoning might resonate with those of you who, in our last episode, were in the camp that believed art required an intentional artist.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.680
In that view, Naruto can’t claim the pics, because he probably didn’t understand himself as deliberately taking self-portraits.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.780
But, arguably, Slater’s intention didn’t
shape the pictures either.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.090
He didn’t decide how to position the camera
or when to click the shutter.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.190
But he did decide to go to that particular location, knowing it was full of curious little primates with opposable thumbs that would make working a camera possible.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.340
So what do you think?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.720
Is there any artist behind these pictures?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.770
And if there is, who is it?

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.080
Maybe it’s a collaboration, and Slater and
Naruto should split the profit.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.870
I bet one of them would be willing to take
his cut in chom choms!

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.140
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.120
One of the first people to really consider
the philosophical questions of art was Aristotle.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.380
Unlike his teacher, Plato, Aristotle was generally
pro-art, because he saw it as useful.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.420
He believed our bodies need to experience a full range of emotions in order to stay in balance.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.280
He argued that, if we haven’t been sad in a while, or had a good adrenaline rush, we can start to crave those feelings.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.940
And when we don’t – or can’t – experience the full range of emotions in our actual lives – art can step in and do the job for us.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:52.580
When we finally do experience these sensations we’ve been yearning for, we feel a pleasurable release that Aristotle called catharsis.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.720
And while John has often insisted that Aristotle
was spectacularly wrong about everything,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:05.000
Aristotle’s theory of catharsis does a beautiful job of resolving a little conundrum in aesthetics that’s known as the Problem of Tragedy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.460
This is the weird puzzle of why people voluntarily
walk into a theatre, clutching a box of tissues,

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.440
fully prepared to bawl their eyes out for
two hours, having paid for the privilege.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.990
I mean, really, why is the tearjerker even
a thing?

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.840
According to Aristotle: catharsis.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:30.440
A scary movie or a tearjerker can allow us to express strong negative emotions in a safe context, and the emotional purge that comes with the experience feels really, really good.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.560
No doubt, when it comes to evoking emotions
in us, art can be extremely effective.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.840
But how does it manage to do that?

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.080
Why is art so good at making us feel?

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.660
When you think about it, it’s actually pretty weird that we get so emotionally invested in characters that we know to be fictional.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.860
Why do we cry real tears over the deaths of
our beloved characters?

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:52.400
Why do invest time and energy in “shipping”?

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.640
These questions fall under another problem that art poses for us, one that aestheticians call the Paradox of Fiction.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:08.680
Contemporary American philosopher Kendall Walton explains why we can be moved by things that aren’t real, by arguing that the emotional responses we have to fictional events aren’t real either.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:19.780
Instead, he says, we experience what he calls “quasi-emotions,” basically emotion-like responses that can be triggered by fiction, but don’t exist or function on the level of true emotions.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:26.240
Now, as evidence for this, Walton points out that people don’t respond to scary movies as they would to real-life terror.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.960
Like, when we’re watching a scary movie, we don’t run out of the theatre and call 911 like we would if we saw a real person in danger.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.520
But other thinkers, like American philosopher
Noel Carroll, disagree.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.800
Carroll argues that we can have real emotional
responses to fictional characters and situations.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.780
Our emotions don’t have to correspond to external reality, in order for the emotions themselves to be real, he says.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:53.080
So we can feel just as strongly for the loves and losses of our favorite characters as we can for the plights of our friends and family.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.140
Now, it’s time to think back to Helena,
and the goldfish in the blenders.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:01.340
Helena raises questions about the relationship
between morality and art.

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:03.639
And here, there are two main schools of thought.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:08.539
Some people, called autonomists, maintain
that art and morality are entirely separate.

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.120
So if something is done in the name of art,
it’s basically immune from moral scrutiny.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.740
It’s almost like artists live and work in
some kind of protective morality-bubble.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:26.400
So, in the autonomist view, Evaristti did nothing wrong in putting goldfish in a situation where they were likely to be pulverized, because he was doing it in the name of artistic expression.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.980
But, there are others, known as aesthetic moralists, who argue that morality and art are interconnected,

00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:36.060
so any moral stain connected with a work makes
a work aesthetically flawed.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:43.240
In this view, even if Evaristti’s aesthetic concept was superb, the fact that he expressed that concept through immoral means –

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:49.180
in this case, the wanton destruction of goldfish life – that counts against the overall aesthetic value of his work.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:53.240
Art is often designed to challenge our beliefs
and our values.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.410
And most of us agree that this can be a good
thing.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.600
But, are there limits?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:02.620
We often give artists credit for amazing works of art that inspire positive change in the world, like Uncle Tom’s Cabin.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:08.000
But if a work inspires bad actions or bad
attitudes, is the artist to blame for that too?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.460
As in most areas of philosophy, there’s plenty more about aesthetics that we could explore if we had time.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.780
But as we move onto the next segment of our course, I hope you’ve found that aesthetics – one of the less well-known areas of philosophy –

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.300
is worth your attention, as you continue to interact with art in your lives.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:28.720
Today we learned about R. G. Collingwood’s view that art is best when it helps us live better lives.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:35.600
We learned how Aristotle’s concept of catharsis can resolve the problem of tragedy, and we studied the paradox of fiction.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.280
We also thought about the debate between autonomism and moralism.
