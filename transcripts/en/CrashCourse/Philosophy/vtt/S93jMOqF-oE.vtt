00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.990
Remember when you were little and your mom told you to eat your spinach so you’d grow up big and strong?

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.010
Or in college, when you set your clock ten minutes ahead, to fool yourself into getting to class on time?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.530
We all engage in useful fictions – things that we choose to believe, because, they just make life easier.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.710
And when we do this, we are being pragmatists.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.600
Pragmatism is based on the theory that finding
true beliefs is

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.259
less important than finding beliefs that work,
practically, in the living of your life.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.119
In this view, it doesn’t really matter whether
spinach actually helps muscle growth;

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.120
if eating spinach will improve your life, and believing that it’ll make you strong convinces you to eat it

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.740
– then it’s a useful belief, which is
all that matters.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.560
Pragmatism is relatively recent as philosophical
movements go.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.710
But some of the most well-known American pragmatists

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.540
– like William James, and, I would argue,
Indiana Jones –

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.920
have an ideological ancestor in 17th century
mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.129
You can be a pragmatist about basically anything –

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.500
knowledge, spinach, metaphysics, ethics,
or whether it’s actually 11:30 right now or 11:40.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.860
But Pascal took a pragmatic approach to one of the biggest issues in philosophy: God’s existence.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:20.300
[Theme Music]

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.460
Pascal was a theist, which, given his place
in history may not be all that surprising.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.040
But what is weird is that Pascal’s argument for God’s existence had very little to do with whether God was actually real.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.100
Instead, it had everything to do with with
whether belief in his existence was practical.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.660
This reasoning became known as Pascal’s Wager, and it’s really a gambler’s argument for religious belief.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.500
Pascal’s thinking went like this:

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.579
Either God exists or he doesn’t, and reason
will never give us an answer.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.900
So you must choose blindly to believe or not to
believe in God – you can’t abstain from choosing

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.420
If you choose to believe in God and he exists,
you get an infinite reward – heaven.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.200
If you choose to believe in God and he doesn’t
exist, you’re not really out much.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.229
If you choose not to believe in God and he
doesn’t exist, you also don’t gain much.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.560
If you choose not to believe in God and he
does exist, you get infinite punishment – hell.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.549
Therefore, the smart bet is to put your
chips on God existing, every time.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.460
Pascal argued that, if there is the slightest chance that God exists – even if that chance is low –

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.919
only a fool would bet against his existence,
given that the stakes are so high.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.279
In the face of incomplete information, Pascal
decided,

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.679
we should play the odds, and believe whatever
offers us the greatest benefit.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.840
It’s kind of brilliant, right?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.800
But there are a couple of ways you could argue
against this.

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:34.059
You might say Pascal’s done the math wrong
– that choosing to walk the straight and

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.719
narrow in the service of an imaginary deity
actually does cost you something.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.879
Like, you might miss out on stuff that you
would otherwise want to do –

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.939
like, sleeping in on Sunday mornings, or living a heavy-metal-rock-star lifestyle, or, I dunno, coveting stuff.

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.540
By this logic, you’d lose out if you abstained
from all of that in the name of something

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.010
that ended up not being real.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.010
But Pascal, like William James, disagreed
with this line of reasoning,

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.650
because he saw great personal benefit in being
a believer.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.120
He thought theists have better lives, not because God is blessing them as some kind of reward,

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.659
but because belief simply has inherent benefits –

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.780
like the security of feeling that the world
is ordered and meaningful…

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.800
That someone is always looking out for you…

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.140
That death isn’t the end.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.940
Now, even if you agree that religious belief is comforting, you might still question Pascal’s motives.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.040
Does believing in something because it’s
the safest bet really win you a ticket to heaven?

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.249
Doesn’t God want you to be less self-interested
when it comes to believing in him?

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:23.699
Well, not according to Pascal.

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.539
He thought how and why you choose to believe
doesn’t really matter, because the fact is,

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.360
God doesn’t care how he gets you, as long
as he gets you.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.760
OK, so how do you will yourself into believing in something, just because it’s where the smart money is?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.049
Easy! Pascal said you essentially brainwash
yourself into true belief,

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.909
so that what starts out as self-interest can
eventually grow into an honest conviction.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.540
And you do this, basically, by walking the
walk and talking the talk.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.430
Start going to church. Start praying.
Hang out with other believers.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.720
At first it might seem weird and disingenuous, but over time, it’ll become an ingrained part of your belief system.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.460
You know what it’s kind of like?
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:00.010
It’s probably pop-culture’s finest allegory
of pragmatic belief in action.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.829
Throughout the whole Indiana Jones trilogy – I’m just gonna pretend the fourth one was never made –

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.519
Indy is painted as a pretty agnostic character.

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.439
He hunts religious relics for a living,

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.189
but the powers that those relics are said
to possess are just “hocus pocus” to him.

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.250
So, at the end of The Last Crusade,
(spoilers) Indy manages to find the Holy Grail,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.889
in an ancient temple, after getting through
a bunch of booby traps.

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.019
And each trap is kind of a test of faith.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.840
He has to know where to kneel, and how to
spell the name of God,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.169
and he has to jump into an abyss with the
hope that he will somehow survive.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.229
Indy ends up passing all of these tests.

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.580
But not because he suddenly stops being agnostic and starts believing in God – at least not that we know of.

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.780
Instead, he just does what he has to do.
He’s literally going through the motions.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.220
There’s something about that, that would
make Pascal proud.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.760
Because, to him, it would probably look like Indy was on the path to eventually, truly believing.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.720
Now, some critics have pointed out that, when
it comes to a really usable belief system,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.139
you’re gonna need morethan just: fake it
‘til you make it.

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:56.560
For example, maybe you were one of those kids, raised in a religious household, who was just never feeling it.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.960
We all know people who were immersed in a
culture of religious belief from birth,

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.990
but end up to rejecting those beliefs as adults.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.909
And for those people, trying to force yourself
to believe is not only ineffective,

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.479
it can lead to some pretty serious unhappiness
– the exact opposite of what a pragmatist wants.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.900
So it might be that, for a pragmatist, the best advice for non-believers is that they just gotta live their lives.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.020
Maybe they’ll find God and maybe they won’t,

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.080
but making yourself swallow it like medicine
doesn’t seem like the way to maximize belief.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.440
OK, so Pascal said that we should believe
in God because belief is just practically useful.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.560
But Soren Kierkegaard, the 19th century Danish
philosopher, went even further.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.140
He adopted the famous tenant of fideism, stating:
“I believe because it is absurd to believe.”

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.599
Fideism is the school of thought that says
religious belief has to come from faith alone.

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.820
It says that stuff like arguments and evidence
actually kill what’s great about religion

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.710
– which is wonder and mystery.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.970
Kierkegaard said that the fantastic thing
about belief in God is that it’s entirely irrational

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.919
– you can’t do it with your brain.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.479
You have to take what he called the leap to
faith.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.719
And, again, here I turn to Indiana Jones.

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:02.009
Remember when Indy faces his last test of
faith-slash-booby trap in the Last Crusade?

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:06.110
He has to try to make an impossible jump across
a scary dark pit to get to the Holy Grail.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.509
There is no way he can do it – it’s suicide.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.599
But, it turns out, there’s a bridge.

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.479
He can’t see it, but in order to find out
that it’s there, he has to take that step.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.700
He has to take a chance on something that
defies all reason.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.400
That’s what religion is all about, according
to Kierkegaard.

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.460
We jump and hope like hell that God catches
us.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.550
And the only way to know, is to jump.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.449
We have to surrender reason to get to truth.

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:34.569
Now, I hate to break it to you, but this is
the end of our unit on the philosophy of religion.

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.270
I’m interested to hear what you think about
that in the comments.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.450
But before we go, I want to head to the Thought
Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:44.870
Our old friend Bertrand Russell once posited
the existence of a china teapot,

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.379
orbiting the sun somewhere between Earth and
Mars.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.100
Let’s say that back on Earth there were a
bunch of Teapot-ists, people who argued that,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.669
since we can’t disprove the teapot’s existence,
they were justified in believing in it.

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:01.159
Not only that, they constructed great buildings, erected statues, composed songs, held weekly services,

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:03.729
and appealed to the teapot for help in their
daily lives.

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.999
But everyone else thought the Teapot-ists
were ridiculous, because there was no evidence

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:09.830
to support their belief in the teapot.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.550
For their part, the Teapot-ists just replied that none of the Ateapot-ists could prove that it wasn’t there.

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.700
Thanks, Thought Bubble! Aaand I’m sure you
can see where I’m going with this.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.360
Pragmatism, or the leap to faith, might be
a solution to the problem of God’s existence,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.420
if you’re not satisfied with any of the
other, more evidence-based arguments.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.580
But believing something because it’s expedient

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:30.680
– or because it frees you from having to have
any reasons at all – can still have its risks.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.660
After all, if we can leap to God, we can also leap to Russell’s teapot, or to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.840
Or, much worse, we could leap to particular
beliefs about God

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:42.860
– like that he wants us to deny rights to
certain kinds of people – or kill them.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.659
These beliefs aren’t representative of the
views of most theists, but the problem is,

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:50.900
if you’re giving up on reasons and evidence,
all beliefs are philosophically equal.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.280
We count on evidence and justification to help us adjudicate between beliefs, to decide what we value.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:01.200
If you throw that out, and fall back on faith alone, the sum of your religious arguments is going to end up being:

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.840
I have faith in the things I choose to have
faith in.

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:07.159
And in that case, no one can tell anyone else
that their belief is wrong,

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:11.009
or dangerous, or unjustified, because you
can’t justify faith.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.620
Today we’ve thought a bunch about about
religious pragmatism and Pascal’s Wager,

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.379
and we’ve also learned about fideism and
Kierkegaard’s leap to faith.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.480
Next time we’re going to learn about existentialism, which is a movement Kierkegaard is considered to belong to.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.800
But as we will see, existentialists can come
in many different flavors.
