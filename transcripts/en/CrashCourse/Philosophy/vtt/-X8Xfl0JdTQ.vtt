00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.970
Imagine being alive when Albert Einstein was
developing his theories of relativity.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.920
Or witnessing the birth of psychology, as Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis took over the scientific mainstream.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.080
The early 1900s was an amazing time for Western
science.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.439
There was another figure on the intellectual
scene when these great minds were at work.

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.439
Young philosopher Karl Popper was born in
Austria -- Freud’s home turf -- but built

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.810
his career in Britain, giving serious consideration
to the new ways that these and other scientists

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.739
of the time were thinking about the world.

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.559
And after looking at different methods that
people like Einstein and Freud were using,

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.680
Popper came to understand that not all scientific
achievement was created equal.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.120
He ended up making an important distinction,
between science … and what he called pseudo-science.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.180
And in the process of doing this, he taught
us volumes about the nature of knowledge itself,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.280
and how we can best test it, and challenge
it, to bring us closer to the truth.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:07.820
[Theme Music]

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.420
Emerging at roughly the same point in history,
Freud and Einstein both made predictions that

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.060
they hoped would help us better understand
our world.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.070
Freud, concerned with the individual psyche,
predicted that our childhood experiences would

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.450
have a heavy bearing on who we grew up to
be.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.490
Meanwhile, Einstein waited patiently for a
solar eclipse that could disprove his entire

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.520
general theory of relativity, depending on what it would reveal about how light travels through space.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.740
And then there was Karl Popper, born in 1902,
who grew up to observe these predictions with

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.540
keen interest. As a young scholar, he learned
about the psychoanalytic theories of Freud,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.790
and attended lectures given by Einstein himself
about the rules of the universe.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.030
And he noticed that these great thinkers used
different methods.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.060
For example, Popper observed that Freud was
able to make just about any data point work

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.390
in service of his theory. Freud could explain
a person’s intimacy issues both in terms

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.970
of not being hugged enough as a child, or
in terms of having been hugged too much. Meanwhile,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.490
almost any behavior on the part of a female
could be explained in terms of penis envy.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.540
Evidence to support Freud’s theories seemed
to be everywhere!

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.909
But Popper saw that Einstein was making a
different type of prediction.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.290
Instead of looking backward, and using past
data to “predict” the present, he was

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.620
looking ahead, and predicting future states
of affairs. Einstein’s theory was truly

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.560
risky, Popper realized. Because, if the future
didn’t match his predictions, then his theory

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.780
would be conclusively disproven. If the results
of the solar eclipse in 1919 had been different,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.180
general relativity would have been finished.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.659
Freud, on the other hand, could always just
read the past differently, so as to maintain

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:37.810
some kind of confirmation of his theory.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.140
Suddenly, Popper understood the difference
between the science that Einstein was doing,

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.040
and what Freud was doing, which Popper rather
snootily referred to as pseudo-science.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.609
Now, whether psychology today is considered
a hard science or a social science or some

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.760
other kind might be debatable. But you won’t
find many mainstream thinkers who consider

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.680
it pseudoscience. But still, nearly a hundred
years ago, when Popper was reaching these

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.920
conclusions, no modern philosopher had really
characterized what “science” truly meant

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.560
-- and what the implications were for the
pursuit of knowledge.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.030
The traditional understanding of the scientific
method, going all the way back to the ancient

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.709
Greeks, relied on the belief that, to look
at the world with a scientific eye is to observe

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.340
with no preconceived notions.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.079
You simply look, see what you see, and then
develop hypotheses based on those observations.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.439
So, you look at a swan, and you notice it’s
white. You look at another swan; it’s white too.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.060
You look at enough white swans, and eventually
you form the hypothesis that all swans are white.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.739
This is what Freud said he was doing: Observing
relationships -- but instead of it being between

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.819
the relationship swans and colors, it was between particular human phenomena and human behavior.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.580
But Popper argued that everyone has preconceived
notions of some kind. We all start out with

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.719
a hunch, whether we admit it or not.

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.579
After all, what you decide to observe is determined
by what you already care about enough to observe

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.400
in the first place and the fact that you care
about it so much also means that you already

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.879
have some beliefs about it.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.549
So, what does that tell us about Freud?

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.769
Popper became convinced that methods like his that only served to confirm beliefs were pseudo-science.

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.700
And they could be used
to prove anything.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.500
Consider the existence of Santa Claus. If
I try to find evidence of Santa’s existence,

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.779
I’m going to find it, easily. The world
is filthy with evidence of Santa Claus! There

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:15.109
are presents under the tree on Christmas morning.
There’s the guy at the mall. And then there

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:21.109
are all those songs, and stories, and tv shows, and movies – they combine to confirm your belief in Santa.

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.580
But Popper would argue that it’s only by seeking to disprove Santa’s existence that you can demonstrate his unreality.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:32.300
So the question is, when we begin to test a theory, are we looking to confirm it, or disconfirm it?

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.620
This is the key point, for Popper – science
disconfirms, while pseudoscience confirms.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.580
He elaborated on this insight by establishing a series of distinct conclusions about science and knowledge.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.500
First, he said, it’s easy to find confirmation
of a theory if you’re looking for it.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.500
Remember the presents under the tree? If
you’re looking for proof that Santa exists, you’re not

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.620
likely to keep searching for contradictory
evidence after that.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.480
Second, confirmation should only count if
it comes from risky predictions – ones that

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.640
could actually destroy your theory. Because,
Popper observed that every good scientific

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.240
theory is prohibitive – it rules things
out.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.570
This might sound strange, because no one wants
to be wrong, but Popper says that every false

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.540
belief we discover is actually good, because that gets us that much closer to believing only true things.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.860
Next, Popper argued that the only genuine test of a theory is one that’s attempting to falsify it.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.200
So, if you were to test for Santa’s reality, your method would require you to try to prove that he doesn’t exist,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.820
rather than proving that he does. So, you stay up all night, waiting to catch him delivering his presents.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:34.500
This is risky, because if the person who actually shows up to put presents under the tree is your Dad,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.640
then you’ve destroyed the Santa hypothesis.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:41.400
On a very similar note, Popper also pointed
out that irrefutable theories are not scientific.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.240
If it can’t be tested, then your theory
doesn’t have much value.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.700
Like, you can only confirm that Santa is real
by doing everything in your power to prove

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.000
that he’s imaginary, and then failing to
do so. So you need to be tugging on Santa

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.260
beards at the mall. You need to investigate
reports of Santa sightings, and other weirdoes

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.700
caught breaking into peoples’ houses through
their chimneys. If you want to be able to

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.990
really trust in your belief in Santa, in a
genuinely scientific way, you need to put

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.170
your belief to the test, in every way you
can imagine.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.200
This is where Popper says that you have earned
the right to call a theory scientific.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.960
And finally, once you’ve disproven your theory, Popper said, you need to be willing to give it up.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.740
I mean, you can still cling to the Santa myth, even after catching your Dad putting gifts under the tree,

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.420
by accepting his lie that Santa had dropped the gifts off earlier, and that he was just “helping.”

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.320
But, if you’re a scientist, you’re gonna
have to be willing to let your beliefs go.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.360
Accept the evidence. Move on.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.780
And this is the modern scientific thinking that we
accept today: Testable, refutable, falsifiable.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.160
You don’t seek to prove scientific hypotheses
right, you only prove them wrong.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.180
A lot of this might seem so obvious that maybe
you’re wonder why we’re talking about it.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.560
But that’s how right Popper was – he
was one of those rare philosophers who actually

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.340
managed to hit on an idea so right that we don’t
even really argue about it anymore.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.830
So, it sounds like I’ve been talking mainly
about science all this time. But Popper and

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.770
his insights actually tell us a lot about
knowledge, in the philosophical sense.

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.120
For Popper, knowledge was about probability
and contingency. We are justified in believing

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.080
whatever seems most probable given our current
data. And we should always be willing to revise

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.800
our beliefs in the light of new evidence. In other words, our belief should be contingent on the data themselves.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.300
This wouldn’t have satisfied Descartes,
who was always concerned about certainty.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:25.160
But Popper never thought that certainty was
possible in the first place. If anything,

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.180
he thought being certain of something
causes you to close your mind, and that’s

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.030
not what we want. Always remaining open to
the idea that your current beliefs might be

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:35.610
wrong is the best way to get ever closer to
truth.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:36.860
So where does this leave us?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.000
Remember, we started out trying to prove that
we know the things we thought we knew. But

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.870
you have to be open to the idea that your
beliefs might be false -- because that’s

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.150
the only way that holding onto them can really
mean anything. Otherwise, we’re all just

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:53.050
believing whatever we want, with no grounds
for adjudicating between beliefs.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.280
You should keep that in mind, because that’s
the name of the game for the rest of this course.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.120
You only get to believe the things
you have reasons for, and we’re going to

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:03.800
start with the area that is hardest for most
people – God. Hope to see you there.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.340
Today you learned about Karl Popper, and his
insights into science, pseudoscience, and

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:12.920
knowledge -- which might best be summarized as science disconfirms, while pseudoscience confirms.
