00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.840
Over the centuries, the effort to craft a perfect, bullet-proof argument for the existence of God has taken many forms.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.840
There was the ontological argument of Anselm. There were the four cosmological arguments of Aquinas.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.880
And they still have their supporters. But
many modern philosophers feel that they’re

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.090
simply too flawed -- too inconsistent with our scientific understanding of the universe -- to be convincing today.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.900
But there was a fifth argument posited by
Thomas Aquinas.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.739
And it was popularized several hundred years
after his time -- in the late 1700s, by the

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.670
English Christian philosopher William Paley.
And this argument for God’s existence is

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.940
still around today, too. In fact, it’s one
of the most popular.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.900
It’s known as the teleological argument.
You may know it as Intelligent Design.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:58.180
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.880
To make his case for the existence of God, William Paley gave us what’s known as an argument by analogy.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.800
This form of inductive argument invites us
to consider a particular state of affairs

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.969
-- let’s just call it Situation A -- about
which we’re already likely to have certain

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.890
beliefs, and then likens it to Situation B,
with which we are less familiar.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.090
The idea is that, in the interest of consistency,
whatever conclusions we’ve drawn about A,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.800
we ought to draw about B as well.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.439
You can make an argument by analogy about
anything, but Paley used it to talk about

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.520
God, in what’s known as the Watchmaker Analogy.
He asked us to imagine what we’d think if

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.659
we found a watch on the ground. Would we imagine that the watch simply appeared randomly, spontaneously,

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.469
on its own? Or would we see the complexity
of it, and notice that its parts seem to come

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.670
together in a particular way in order to accomplish
a goal? If so, wouldn’t we think that the

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.340
watch must have been made by someone, on purpose?

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.780
Paley was arguing that the teleology demonstrated
by a watch would lead us to conclude that

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.760
it was designed by an intelligent creator
with a particular end in mind.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.360
Teleological means goal-oriented, or purposeful.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.960
And we can easily pick out the teleologies
of man-made objects. Got a mug here, as an

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.020
example -- it was created with a particular
teleology in mind. It was designed to hold

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.039
a liquid without leaking. It’s got a handle
put here deliberately, in such a way that

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.819
human fingers could easily fit into it. And
its composition is such that it’ll keep

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.790
the liquid inside warm without burning the
hand that holds it.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.720
We wouldn’t assume that a coffee cup would
simply come to be, exhibiting such perfect

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.190
design for its particular function, without
someone having created it that way on purpose.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.239
So, in the same way that the teleology of
a cup implies the existence of a cup maker,

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.560
and that of a watch implies the existence
of a watchmaker, Paley saw teleology in the

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.030
world, and assumed from that, God’s existence.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.350
He continued his analogy by comparing a watch
to a living organism.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.180
Look at the complexity of the human body.
Heart and lungs working together, producing

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.750
sweat to keep ourselves from overheating,
transforming food into energy – we’re

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.930
just generally amazing all around.Look at
how elements of the natural world operate

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.170
according to complex laws that sustain a beautiful,
natural harmony. Paley said this couldn't possibly just

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.510
have happened, any more than the design of a pocket watch could just have happened.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.040
There must be a designer.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.680
If you accept this analogy, then you agree
with Paley that, just like the purposefulness

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.370
of a watch compels us to believe in a watchmaker,
the purposefulness of the world compels us

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.700
to believe in a worldmaker – God.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.900
And you might think this is a fantastic argument. It might even be what motivates your own belief in God.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.180
There are lots of people who say things like sunsets and babies show them that there must be a designer-god.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.120
But some of you probably aren’t buying it
– and you know what to do!

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.420
Arguments are refuted by counterarguments,
so when you want to refute an argument by

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.099
analogy, you offer a disanalogy. Basically,
you demonstrate that Situation A and Situation

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.099
B are dissimilar enough that the analogy doesn’t
actually work.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.940
So, to object to Paley, we have to identify
a way in which elements of the natural world

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.200
– like human bodies – are relevantly dissimilar
to watches. When we’re talking about a watch,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.189
an objector might say, it obviously had a
creator. After all, we can take it apart and

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.180
see clearly how the gears fit together to
move the hands and keep time. But there’s

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.150
so much in the natural world that isn’t
understandable in the same way. For instance,

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.040
why would God have designed our eyes to have
a blind spot?

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.239
Paley responded that it doesn’t matter whether
we can understand how something was created.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.040
The point is simply that it was. He might
point out, for instance, that I actually don’t

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.340
understand the inner workings of my phone.
But I still know it had a creator.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.620
Whether or not I can understand how it
was created is beside the point.

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.879
Next objection: Some parts of nature seem
to be without purpose. A blind spot obviously

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.579
doesn’t have any function, and neither do
nipples on a man.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.920
Paley’s response here was: Just because we don't know there's a purpose doesn't mean there isn't one.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.420
But this is a problem, too, because his whole
argument for believing in God is that you

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.830
should look at the world and see purpose.
So if we see some things in the world that

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.760
are working great, and really seem to have
complexity and a definite use, and others

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.710
that don’t, that’s a flaw in his argument.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.010
What’s more, the absence of any obvious
purpose in things can lead people to start

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.330
searching for purposes, and effectively make
them up. For instance, I could find a purpose

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.450
for this finger – I could use it as a nose-picker.
It would make a good one – it’s just the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.680
right size to really get in there and dig around.
But was my finger designed to pick noses?

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.900
Probably not. 20th century British philosopher
Bertrand Russell made fun of this

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.470
purpose-finding tendency, by pointing out
that you could look at a bunny and form the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.680
belief that God gave it a fuzzy white tail
so hunters would have something to shoot at.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.460
The point is: If we're the ones inventing
purposes, rather than recognizing ones that

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.900
are inherently there, then we’re the real
creators of purpose in the world, not God.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.440
Basically, if you believe that God made eyes
for seeing, then you also have to believe

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.960
that he designed fingers as nose-pickers,
and rabbit tails as bullseyes, and blind spots

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.210
as ways for us to get into car accidents.
So the counterargument here is: We don't get

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.100
to just pick and choose, and say God designed the stuff we want him to have designed, and not the other stuff.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.980
Rather than searching for disanalogies, another
way Paley’s argument has been countered

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.060
is with an alternative explanation for Condition
B. Paley says bodies are purposeful, and from

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.720
there concludes that the purpose had to have
been put there by an intelligent creator.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.020
But another explanation for how bodies came
to have the complexity and functionality they

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.210
have today, is natural selection and random
mutation. We can concede that the existence

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.080
of a designer-god helped make sense of the
origins the our world in a pre-scientific age,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.800
but now we have a perfectly good scientific explanation for how the complexity of the world came about.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.200
So, who needs a watchmaker when you have evolution
by natural selection?

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.460
Another objection to Paley’s case came from
18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume,

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.630
who pointed out that, if we’re to take the
analogy seriously, we’d need to conclude

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.840
that the creator that Paley posits seems to
make a lot of mistakes.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.330
And not just blind spots.
Like, how about hurricanes?

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.800
Or why would he make our bodies with certain
tissues -- like in the breast, or prostate,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.970
or colon -- that are so incredibly prone to
cancer? Why would he make umbilical cords

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.010
that could wrap around a baby’s neck? Why
would he make butterflies have to wait for

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.710
hours, immobile, for their wings dry as soon
as they come out of their chrysalis, making

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.170
them easy prey for predators?

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:35.010
Hume pointed out that the world is chock full
of stuff that looks cruel, ridiculous, impractical,

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.110
and contrary to life. A flawed world, he said,
implies a flawed creator.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.790
Now, the development of evolutionary biology
over the past couple hundred years has taken

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.810
a pretty heavy toll on the teleological argument.
But it still has many supporters, and their

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.190
method of defending their view is a good model for the way the Socratic method is supposed to work.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.920
When your opponents raise objections to your
theory, you need to either reject it, or modify

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.720
it in a way that responds to those objections.
So, supporters of the teleological argument

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.040
set out to modify – and strengthen – their
view.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.640
Here are a couple of modern responses:

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.510
Contemporary British philosopher Richard Swinburne
gives us a modern teleological argument with

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.940
a twist of probability. He says that, even
if there’s another possible explanation

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.890
for the universe, we should go with the explanation
that’s most likely to be true. And he says

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:17.830
that it’s simply more probable that God
designed the world, than that it came about

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.400
through the pure chance of evolutionary processes.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.060
Likewise, another class of modern defenses
of the teleological argument are collectively

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.600
known as Fine-Tuning Arguments. These arguments
accept the Big Bang and evolution as scientific

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.480
truths, but they maintain that, for the evolution
of life to occur, it’s most likely that

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.320
God set up the precise conditions that it required,
rather than them coming about by accident.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.980
After all, if Earth were just a little closer
to, or farther from, the sun…

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.460
If the composition of our atmosphere was slightly
different…

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.960
If the content of our oceans was something
other than what it is …

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.650
Life would have never taken root.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.330
A lot of people think these modernized arguments
have more going for them than Paley’s did.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:56.020
This is partly because these types of teleologists
have moved from making assertions about certainty

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.100
to making claims about probability, which
seem easier to get right and to defend.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.420
Objectors will counter by saying that the
problem with these arguments is, you can’t

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:07.810
really make a probability claim when you only
have a sample set of one. If we had multiple

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.940
Earths that we could examine, we could see
how likely any particular adaptation is, or

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.850
how unique the conditions for life are. Then
we would know if it were likely or unlikely

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.530
to happen without God. But we can’t know
that -- at least not now -- because we can

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:23.480
only access this one world, where we know
that things evolved as they did. Thus, the

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.780
counterargument goes, Swinburne and other modern teleologists are right to recognize that if

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.980
things were slightly different, then life maybe wouldn’t have evolved or would have evolved very differently.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:36.200
But that is wholly different from claiming that
it’s unlikely to have happened in the first place.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.759
So, today you learned about the teleological
argument, objections to it, and responses

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:44.459
to those objections, and the responses to
the responses to the objections.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.040
But we’ve spent an awful lot of time talking
about God’s existence, so next time,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.200
let’s consider what god is like if it exists.
