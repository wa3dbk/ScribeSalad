00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.420
Aristotle once described humans as “the
rational animal.”

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.059
Well, actually, he said that “man is the
rational animal,” but we don’t have to

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.930
be sexist just because he was.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.420
And if you’ve ever gotten into an argument
with someone about religion or politics or which

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.460
Hemsworth is the hottest, then you’ve experienced
how irrational people can be about their opinions.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.620
But what Aristotle meant is that rationality
is our distinguishing characteristic – it’s

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.329
what sets us apart from the beasts.

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.790
And no matter how much you disagree with someone
about God or Obama or Chris Hemsworth, you

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.140
can at least grant that they are not beasts.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.380
Because, most of the time at least, people
can be persuaded. By arguments.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.140
You use arguments all the time -- in the comments,
at family dinners, with your friends -- you

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.030
probably just don’t think of them the same
way that philosophers do.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.970
When you try and convince your parents to
loan you the car, or when you’re talking

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.710
up Crash Course to your friends, you are using
arguments. Thanks, by the way.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.400
Each time you tell someone to do or believe
something -- or when you’re explaining why

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.020
you do or believe something -- you are giving
an argument.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.880
The problem is, the vast majority of people
aren’t really good at arguments.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.720
We tend to confuse making a good argument
with, like, having witty comebacks, or just

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.810
making your points more loudly and angrily,
instead of building a case on a solid foundation

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.990
of logic. Which can be harder than it sounds.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.000
But learning about arguments and strong reasoning
will not only make you a better philosopher,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.440
it will also set you up to be a more persuasive
person. Someone who people will listen to.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.400
Someone who’s convincing.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.610
So, yeah, these skills are beneficial no matter
what you want to do with your life.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.090
So you might as well know how to argue properly.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:43.380
[Theme Music]

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.520
If you want to learn how to argue, then you
should probably start about 2400 years ago,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.010
when Plato was laying out how reason can,
and should, function in the human mind.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.280
He believed that we all have what he called
a tripartite soul – what you might think

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.439
of as your “self,” or your psyche, divided
into three parts.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.630
First, there’s the rational, or logical
part of the soul, which represents cool reason.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.900
This is the aspect of your self that seeks
the truth and is swayed by facts and arguments.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.180
When you decide to stop eating bacon for two
meals a day because, as delicious as it is,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.620
it’s bad for you, then you make that decision
with the guidance of the rational part of your soul.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.330
But then there’s the spirited aspect, often
described as the emotional part of the self,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.240
although that doesn’t really quite capture
it.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.920
The spirited soul isn’t just about feeling
-- it’s also about how your feelings fuel your actions.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.640
It’s the part that responds in righteous
anger at injustice, the part that drives your

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.970
ambition, and calls upon you to protect others.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.250
It gives you a sense of honor and duty, and
is swayed by sympathy.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.130
So if you decide to stop eating bacon because
you just finished reading Charlotte’s Web,

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.860
and now you’re in love with Wilbur, then
you’re being guided by the spirited part of your soul.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.849
But we share the next part of our soul with
other animals, be they pig, or moose, or aardvark.

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.810
The appetitive part is what drives you to
eat, have sex, and protect yourself from danger.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.340
It is swayed by temptations that are carnal,
and visceral.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.890
So at those times when you go ahead and just
EAT ALL THE BACON because it just smells so

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.069
dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul
is in control.

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.830
Now, Plato believed that the best human beings
-- and I should point out here that Plato

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.950
most definitely did believe that some people
were better than others -- are always ruled

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.240
by the rational part of their soul, because it works
to keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.680
People who allow themselves to be ruled by
their spirited or appetitive selves are base,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.310
he believed, and not fully, properly human.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.080
Now, most of us don’t buy into the concept
of the tripartite soul anymore -- or the idea

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.300
that some humans are less human than others.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:37.900
But we do understand that we’re all motivated by
physical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.260
And philosophers continue to agree with Plato
that reason should be in the driver’s seat.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.450
So, how do you know if you’re good at it?
How can you test your reasoning?

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.519
Well, let’s head over to the Thought Bubble
for some Flash Philosophy.

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.239
Throughout this course, we’re going to apply our
philosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.659
Because remember: Philosophers love thinking about
questions -- especially ones that don’t have ready answers.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.239
So think of these exercises as philosophical
wind-sprints -- quick tests of your mental abilities.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.200
And here’s a doozy, from 20th century British
thinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.060
of what’s known as analytic philosophy.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.620
Say there’s a town in which all men are
required by law to be clean-shaven. This town

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.020
has only one barber, a man, who must follow
strict rules:

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.100
Rule number one: He must shave all men who
do not shave themselves.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.919
Rule number two: He must not shave any man
who does shave himself.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.519
It’s the nightmare of every libertarian and every
mustachio’d hipster. But here’s the question:

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.800
Does the barber shave himself?

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.080
Cause think about it: The barber only shaves
men who don’t shave themselves. So if he does

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.639
shave himself, then he must not, because the barber’s
not allowed to shave guys who shave themselves.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.239
But, if he doesn’t shave himself, then he has
to be shaved by the barber, because that’s the law.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.290
Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the
fact that a group must always be a member of itself.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.300
That means, in this case, that “all men
who shave themselves” has to include every

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.900
guy who shaves himself, including the barber.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.440
Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group’s
existence just doesn’t hold up.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.340
And if the barber is a logical impossibility,
then he can’t exist, which means the reasoning

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.710
behind his existence is inherently flawed.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.990
And philosophy doesn’t tolerate flawed reasoning.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.440
So, how do we make sure that we’re ruled
by good, sound, not-flawed reason?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.480
By perfecting the art of the argument.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.620
An argument, in philosophy, isn’t just a
shouting match.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.700
Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs
should always be backed up by reasons,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.140
which we call premises.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.419
Premises form the structure of your argument.
They offer evidence for your belief, and you

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.130
can have as many premises as you like, as
long as they support your conclusion, which

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.790
is the thing that you actually believe.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.810
So, let’s dissect the anatomy of an argument.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.520
There are actually several different species
of arguments. Probably the most familiar,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.440
and the easiest to carry out, is the deductive
argument.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.920
The main rule of a deductive arguments is: if your
premises are true, then your conclusion must be true.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.100
And knowing that something is actually true
is very rare, and awesome.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.840
So, here’s a boiled-down version of a good
deductive argument:

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.800
Premise 1: All humans are mortal.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.860
Premise 2: Socrates is a human.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.040
Conclusion: Socrates is mortal.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.759
This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads
to another, is called entailment.

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.119
Once we know that all humans are mortal, and that
Socrates is a human, those facts entail that Socrates is mortal.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.919
Deduction begins with the general – in this
case, what we know about human mortality – and

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.910
reasons down to the specific – Socrates
in particular.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.990
What’s great about deductive arguments is
that the truth of the premises must lead to

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.479
the truth of the conclusion.

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:27.680
When this happens, we say that the argument
is valid – there’s just no way for the

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.460
conclusion to be false if the premises are
true.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.840
Now check out this argument:

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.289
All humans are mortal. Socrates is a human.
Therefore, Socrates was Plato’s teacher

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:41.820
That argument is invalid, because nothing about human
mortality can prove that Socrates was Plato’s teacher.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:45.699
As you might have noticed, there are plenty
of mortal humans who never taught Plato.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.050
What’s interesting, though, is that this
argument does happen to have a true conclusion,

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.670
which leads us to another issue. And that
is:

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:55.090
Validity is not the same as truth.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.860
All ‘valid’ really means is that if the premises
are true, then your conclusion can’t be false.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.180
But that doesn’t mean that your
premises prove your conclusion to be correct.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.740
Like, in the case of whether Socrates was
Plato’s teacher, the premises are true,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.830
and the conclusion is true, but the argument
is still not valid -- because the premises

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.139
don’t in any way prove the conclusion. It
just happens to be true.

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:19.439
So, if your premises don’t guarantee the truth of your
conclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.560
Like this one:
- All cats are mammals

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.780
- I’m a mammal
- Therefore, I’m a cat

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.940
As much as part of me would like to be my
cat, this is invalid because the conclusion

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.480
doesn’t entail from the premises…at all.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.620
I mean, all cats are mammals, but all mammals
aren’t cats. Which means there are such

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.020
things as non-cat mammals, which I am just
one example of.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.980
And it probably goes without saying, but you can
have a perfectly valid argument and still have a false

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.920
conclusion, if any of your premises are false.
For example:  - All humans have tails

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.860
- My brother John is a human
- Therefore, John Green has a tail!

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:55.720
The argument is totally valid! – Because the premises
entail the conclusion! The reasoning totally stands up!

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.920
It’s just that one of the premises is flawed.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.740
Since I’m reasonably certain that John doesn’t
have a tail -- I’ve seen him in a bathing

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.270
suit -- this argument is not deductively sound.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:07.970
And a deductively sound argument is one that’s
free of formal flaws or defects.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.419
It’s an argument whose premises are all
true, and that’s valid, which means its

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:13.599
conclusion is guaranteed to be true.

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:15.870
So, sound arguments should always be your
goal.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.140
The reason that deduction is prized by philosophers
-- and lots of other important kinds of thinkers

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.880
-- is that it’s the only kind of argument
that can give you a real certainty.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:29.360
But it’s limited, because it only works if you’re starting
with known, true premises, which are hard to come by.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.399
And for what it’s worth, deductive truths
are usually pretty obvious. They don’t tend

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:39.059
to lead us to startlingly new information, like the fact
that I’m not a cat, or that John doesn’t have a tail.

00:08:39.069 --> 00:08:42.520
So instead of starting with premises that
are already certain, like deduction does,

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:47.260
you’re gonna have to know how to determine
the truth of, and your confidence in, your premises.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.080
Which means you’re going to have to acquaint
yourself with the other species of arguments,

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.739
which we’re gonna do next time.

00:08:52.739 --> 00:08:56.369
But today, we talked about the value of reason,
the structure of arguments, and we took a

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.379
close look at one kind of argument: deductive
reasoning.
