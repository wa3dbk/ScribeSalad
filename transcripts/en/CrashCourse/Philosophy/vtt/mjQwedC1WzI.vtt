00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.390
What are you afraid of?
Spiders? Public speaking? The dentist? Calculus?

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:13.520
What about death?

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.980
How you feel about death has probably been shaped by your beliefs about whether or not there’s an afterlife

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:20.750
– and if there is, what it’s like.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.740
The ancient Egyptians believed that, at death,
your heart would be weighed against a feather,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.109
to determine if it was fit to enter the underworld.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.199
A heart heavy with mis-deeds would be fed
to a demon.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.230
Christians may envision Saint Peter, waiting
at the pearly gates to welcome you into heaven,

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.420
unless your name doesn’t make his list.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.360
Imagine not only being turned away from the coolest club in town, but banished to the eternal torments of hell.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.960
As we learned in our discussions about the philosophy of religion, when the stakes are eternal,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.240
it’s only reasonable to get a little nervous about what’s basically the Ultimate Final Exam.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.059
But if it makes you feel any better, many
philosophers have believed, and still believe,

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.399
that death is nothing to fear.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:05.520
[Theme Music]

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.200
In 399 BCE, Socrates was sentenced to death
for, among other things,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.090
refusing to acknowledge the official deities
of Athens,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.719
radicalizing youth, and generally honking
off the people in charge.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:21.289
But even when he faced his own imminent death,
he remained calm and unafraid.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.359
He was a philosopher, after all.
And fear was no match for his ability to argue.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.509
Socrates didn’t think we could know if there’s
an afterlife or not,

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.600
but he thought there were really only two
possibilities.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.860
And as far as he was concerned, neither of
them was anything to be afraid of.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860
Here’s his argument:

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.920
Either death is a dreamless sleep
Or death is a passage to another life

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.149
Dreamless sleeps are nice, not scary
(Socrates said he could use the rest)

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.429
And a passage to another life sounds good,
too,

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.500
because he’ll get to hang out with cool
people from the past who have already died

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630
Therefore, either way, death is nothing to
fear

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.710
Socrates’ idea of the afterlife was Hades, which he seems to have pictured as being a lot like Athens,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.069
except that no one had any physical bodies
– only disembodied minds.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.509
And frankly he thought that sounded awesome,
because bodies can be a real pain;

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.590
they just need to be fed, and require rest.
Just, so much upkeep.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.179
So, in the afterlife, Socrates imagined he’d
get to have endless philosophical conversations,

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.030
and continue learning new things, with the
greatest thinkers of the past.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.400
And they wouldn’t have to take a break to
eat or sleep or pee!

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.040
Now, Socrates recognized that, although his favorite activity, philosophizing, didn’t require a body, some things do.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.000
And if all of your favorite pastimes are physical,
you might find the afterlife disappointing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.790
That’s why Socrates recommended spending
your life looking after your mind,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.360
cultivating that part of you that you’ll
get to keep forever – if there’s an afterlife.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.470
If you do that, when the time comes for you
to die, you’ll actually see death as a benefit,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.050
because you won’t be troubled by bodily
things, while your mind will be in top form.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.540
But what if there isn’t an afterlife?

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.580
What about that “dreamless sleep” that
Socrates spoke about?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.290
Isn’t total annihilation of the self, like,
the scariest thing there is?

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.870
Ancient Stoic philosopher Epicurus didn’t
think so.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.080
He lived about a hundred years after Socrates,
and he rejected belief in an afterlife altogether.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.810
Instead, he said we’re just our bodies,
and nothing more.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.829
But still, he still didn’t find death scary.

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.590
Here’s his argument.
Death is the cessation of sensation.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.709
Good and evil only make sense in terms of
sensation.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.110
So, Death is neither good nor evil.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.180
Epicurus was convinced that things are only
evil, or bad, if they feel bad.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.590
And he didn’t mean only physical feelings.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.099
Anyone who’s ever had a broken heart will tell you that it’s a lot more painful, and harder to heal, than a broken leg.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.300
But a broken heart is still a sensation – you
need a body to experience it – so as a materialist –

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.980
someone who believed that You equal Your Body
– death just meant nonexistence.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.819
And there was nothing scary about that, because,
well,

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.319
there won’t be any you to have any feelings
about not existing!

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.060
Epicurus argued that fearing nonexistence is not only stupid, but it gets in the way of enjoying life.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.959
You are alive, and experiencing sensations,
now.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.989
So, he said, make those sensations as great
as possible,

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.500
and don’t worry about when those sensations
are going to stop! YOLO!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.879
To help you understand Epicurus and his attitudes
about death a little better,

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.560
let’s head over to the Thought Bubble for
some Flash Philosophy.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.549
Think about a hangover. If you haven’t had
one, imagine what they might be like.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.430
Hangovers aren’t bad for you before you
get one, right?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.329
In fact, the thing that comes before the hangover
is often quite pleasant, what with all the laughing,

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:13.159
and feeling uninhibited, and working up the courage to talk to that cutie from your calculus class.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.679
No, the hangover is only bad while it’s
happening.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.600
And true: It might be bad after it’s over, like, if it kept you from doing well on your calculus exam the next morning,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.320
because you were too busy trying not to barf
in front of said cutie.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.540
But the point is, if something is bad for you, it’s generally bad for you at a particular time, the way a hangover is.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.780
But Epicurus said that death can’t be bad
for you at any time.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.890
Because once it arrives, you’re gone!

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.530
The thing that eventually kills you? Yeah, that’s gonna be bad for you, before your death.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.900
But that’s not death.

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.410
When you think about it, you and Death are
never present at the same time.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.510
And if there’s no you when death is present, then there is no time in which death is bad for you.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.460
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.720
So, things like hangovers and charley horses and movie spoilers are bad, because you’re there to experience them.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:59.040
But as far as Epicurus was concerned, life
was like a night of drinking before a hangover,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.480
which – inevitable as it is –
you will never actually experience.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.820
Now, the 21st century has its own perspectives
on death.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.340
And one might be best described as a kind
of philosophical FOMO.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.940
Contemporary American philosopher Thomas Nagel
points out that some people dread death

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.600
because they’ll miss out on things that
they want to experience.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.980
If you died right now, you’d never get to finish the video game you’re in the middle of,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.320
or read the next George RR Martin book, or
see humans land on Mars.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.380
Which would suck, yeah.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.540
But think about it like this: Cool stuff was going on way before you were born. And you missed it!

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.180
I’m gonna make some assumptions about your
age here

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.320
and say that you weren’t listening when Orson Welles terrified the nation with the War of the Worlds.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.180
You didn’t march on Washington.
You totally missed Woodstock.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.000
So, Nagel asks: If you don’t feel some sort of deep sense of loss at what you missed before you were alive,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.580
why should you feel loss at what you’ll
miss after you die?

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.180
Now, Nagel does point out that, if we believe
that life is essentially good,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.960
then there is something to mourn when a life
is cut short.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.840
Since humans can live, on average, for about
80 years,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.080
someone dying at the age of 20 is a tragedy, because that person missed out on 60 possible years of good times.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.600
But we should pause here to talk about what
you really value about life,

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.050
because that will also have an impact on what
you think about death in general,

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.800
or about the death of a particular person.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.240
If you say that life is just always, inherently, good, then you’re said to place a high value on the sanctity of life.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.130
It doesn’t matter what the content of that
life looks like, or what the person is like.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.780
The fact that they’re alive is just good.
So, losing it would not be good.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.690
But, if you think that quality of life is
what’s important,

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.960
then you’re going to want to distinguish between lives that are full of good experiences, and those that aren’t.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.440
If you value quality of life, you don’t think that there’s something inherently valuable about merely being alive.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.760
So in these terms, some deaths might actually
be positive or valuable –

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.430
like, if they bring about an end to a terrible,
painful existence.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.970
Now, of course, it might make sense to be
afraid of dying itself,

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.200
because the process of dying can be painful and drawn out and involve saying a lot of difficult good-byes.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.000
But maybe Socrates and Epicurus have convinced
you that fearing your own death is absurd.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.580
Well then what about the death of others?
Is it equally silly to fear the death of the people you love?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.040
Probably so, say some philosophers, because
what you’re fearing isn’t actually death;

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.560
what you’re afraid of is being left behind,
alone, when a loved one dies.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.640
And this is a good place to hear from ancient
Chinese Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.220
He lived about the same time as Epicurus, and believed that there’s no reason to fear the death of your loved ones.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.300
He asked, why would you fear the inevitable?

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.500
We know death is going to happen, to everyone, and we also know that it’s a part of the life cycle.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.240
And we don’t see any other part of that
cycle as being bad.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.260
Wouldn’t it be silly, he said, if we mourned
the loss of our babies when they became toddlers,

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.160
or our children when they became teens?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.410
We celebrate every other life milestone, with
birthday parties, bar mitzvahs, and graduations,

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:33.840
to mark the passage of time and the changes
that have come.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.550
Sure, your parents might shed some tears when
they pack you off to college,

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.610
but they also knew that that day was going
to come –

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.060
when you would move away from them and onto
your own life.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.830
So death, according to Zhuangzi, is just one
more change – why treat it differently?

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.510
Instead, he said, you should celebrate the
death of a loved one

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.900
just as you celebrated every other life change
that they experienced.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.220
You should think of their death as a going
away party for a grand journey.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.670
In his view, mourning can actually seem selfish.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.720
When it’s time for the people you love to
move on, Zhuangzi said,

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.110
the last thing you should do is hold them
closer.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.080
Today we talked about death.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.040
We considered philosophical responses – from
Socrates, Epicurus, and Zhuangzi,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.330
about whether it’s logical to fear your
own death, or the deaths of your loved ones.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.860
And we talked about Thomas Nagel, death, and
Fear of Missing Out.
