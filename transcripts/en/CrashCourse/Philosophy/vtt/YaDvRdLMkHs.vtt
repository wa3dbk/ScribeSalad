Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

Squarespace: share your passion with the world.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.600
What gives your life meaning?
God? Love? Money? Work?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.040
Fanfiction? Football? Shopping? Sherlock?

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.820
You might have your own personal sense of
purpose in your life,

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.070
or maybe you’re hoping this course will
help you find one.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.930
Or you might believe that you were created with a certain essence as a human being, with a purpose given to you by God.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.360
Whatever the case is, no one would fault you
for wanting your life to have meaning.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.919
A sense of meaning is something that we all
crave – maybe even need.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.460
And as we move out of our unit on the philosophy
of religion,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.890
we should spend some time talking about how
we understand our lives as being meaningful.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.579
Because when you think about it, a lot of us devote a ton of energy to the task of finding meaning in our lives.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.449
Maybe you find it through religion, or by
fighting for social justice, or educating

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.420
others, or seeking beauty in artistic expression.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.550
No matter how you do it, there’s a group
of philosophers, the existentialists,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.190
who say that any, or all, of these things
can give your life meaning.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.030
But at the same time, they say: None of them
can.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:09.310
[Theme Music]

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.650
As you know by now, philosophy is about the dialectic:

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.760
Someone puts forth an idea, and then someone else responds to it.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.480
Sometimes, the response comes right away.
In other cases, it takes thousands of years.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.579
Way back in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle
took it as given that everything has an essence

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.840
– a certain set of core properties that are necessary,
or essential – for a thing to be what it is.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.420
If those properties were missing, then that
thing would be a different thing.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.220
For instance, a knife could have a wooden
handle or a metal handle – it really doesn’t matter.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.460
But if it didn’t have a blade, it wouldn’t
really be a knife anymore.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.079
The blade is the essential property of the knife, because it gives the knife its defining function.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.030
Now, Plato and Aristotle thought that everything
has an essence – including us.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.000
And they believed that our essences exist
in us before we’re even born.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.200
So by this thinking, part of what it means
to be a good human is to adhere to your essence.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.600
Now, you may or may not know what your essence
is,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.070
and you might be great at living up to your
essence, or you may be awful at it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.789
But the important thing is that your essence
gives you a purpose.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.039
Because you were born to be a certain thing.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.540
This belief, known as essentialism, was the standard view of the universe all the way up until the late 19th century,

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.560
and it’s still accepted by many people today.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.300
But in the late 1800s, some thinkers started to challenge the idea that we are imbued with any essence or purpose.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.640
German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, for
example,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.520
embraced nihilism, the belief in the ultimate
meaningless of life.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.920
But by the mid-20th century, the path had
been paved for

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.140
French thinker Jean-Paul Sartre to return
to the question of essence and ask:

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.280
What if we exist first?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.340
What if we’re born without any hard-wired purpose? And then it’s up to us to find our own essences?

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.700
Well this became the framework for what we
now know as existentialism.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.620
And its mantra is the claim that “existence
precedes essence.”

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.250
In other words, our existence – our birth
– happens first.

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.990
Then, it’s up to each of us to determine
who we are.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.870
We have to write our own essence, through
the way we choose to live.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.550
But we have no actual, predetermined purpose
– there’s no set path that we’re supposed to follow.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.650
It’s hard to express how radical this idea
was at the time.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.030
Because, for thousands of years, you didn’t
have to choose a path, or find your purpose.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.160
God did it for you.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.920
But it’s important to note that existentialism
is not synonymous with atheism.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.890
Plenty of existentialists are atheists, but
some are theists, like Kierkegaard.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.410
What theistic existentialists deny is any
sort of teleology –

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.700
that is, they refute the notion that God made the universe, or our world, or us, with any particular purpose in mind.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.120
So, God may exist – but instilling you,
or your life, or the cosmos, with meaning

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.760
– that’s just not in his job description.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.620
As a result, we are each born into a universe
in which we,

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.440
and our world, and our actions, lack any real,
inherent importance.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.060
This is a fundamental component of existentialism.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.510
And its adherents refer to it as “the absurd.”

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.950
You and I think of absurdity as something
that’s just silly, or preposterous.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.040
But for existentialists, absurdity is a technical
term.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.470
It’s how they describe the search for answers
in an answerless world.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.330
We are creatures who need meaning, but we’re
abandoned in a universe full of meaninglessness.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.540
So we cry into the wilderness, and get no
response.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.230
But we keep crying anyway.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.000
That, for an existentialist, is the definition
of absurd.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.480
Since there’s no teleology, the world wasn’t created for a reason, and it doesn’t exist for a reason.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.100
And if there’s no reason for any of this,
then there’s also no absolutes to abide by:

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.069
There’s no cosmic justice, no fairness,
no order, no rules.

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:25.409
Now, existentialism has its roots in late-19th-century
thinkers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.340
But it really came into its own during and
after World War II,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.449
as the horrors of the Holocaust led many people
to abandon any belief in an ordered world.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.560
And who could blame them?

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.180
When Nazis became possible, meaning became
much harder to find.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.600
But Sartre faced meaninglessness head-on, and explored one of the most agonizing aspects of existentialism.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.240
Not the world’s lack of meaning.
But its terrifying abundance of freedom.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.760
To most of us, freedom sounds pretty great. But Sartre thought that we are painfully, shockingly free.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.600
After all, if there are no guidelines for
our actions,

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.699
then each of us is forced to design our own
moral code, to invent a morality to live by.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.940
Sartre took this to mean that we are “condemned
to be free,” a fate that he found to be quite awful.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.199
You might think that there’s some authority
you could look to for answers, Sartre said,

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.650
but all of the authorities you can think of
are fake.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.370
You can do what your parents say, or your
church, or your government,

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.960
but Sartre said those authorities are really
just people like you,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.380
people who don’t have any answers, people who had to figure out for themselves how to live.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.819
So the best thing you can really do, he determined,
is to live authentically.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.100
Sartre used this to mean that you have to accept the full weight of your freedom in light of the absurd.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.100
You have to recognize that any meaning your
life has, is given to it by you.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.369
And if you decide to just phone it in, and
follow a path that someone else has set

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:46.099
– whether it’s your teachers, your government,
or your religion –

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.919
then you have what he called bad faith, a
refusal to accept the absurd.

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.330
If you live by bad faith, you’re burying
your head in the sand

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.160
and pretending that something out there has
meaning – meaning that you didn’t give it.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.220
Which brings us to this week’s Flash Philosophy.
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:04.180
Sartre explained these ideas through an anecdote about one of his students, who faced a difficult decision.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.560
This young man was at a crossroads in his
life.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.520
He could join the military during wartime, and go off to fight for a cause that he believed in.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.999
And he wanted to do this.
He thought it was right.

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:16.419
But he also had an elderly mother who was
all alone, except for him.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:19.080
If he went to war, he’d leave her behind.
And that seemed wrong.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.800
So he could stay with her, and let others
fight for justice. Or he could go off to war,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.050
and leave his mother to herself, and likely
never see her again.

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.460
The young man felt a sense of duty to both his cause and to his mother, but he could only serve one.

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.800
Moreover, if he went to war, he’d be just
a very small part of a really big cause.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.779
His contribution probably wouldn’t be great,

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:39.819
but he would be contributing to something
that would affect millions of people.

00:06:39.819 --> 00:06:43.919
But if he stayed behind, he’d make an enormous
difference in just one person’s life.

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:45.870
Thanks Thought Bubble. So, what’s the answer?

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:50.909
Sartre said that the whole point of this young man’s decision was that no one could give him an answer.

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:55.489
In fact, there was no answer, until the man
chose one for himself.

00:06:55.489 --> 00:06:57.600
No moral theory could help him decide,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.750
because no one else’s advice could lead
him to a decision that was truly authentic.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.840
So his choice – no matter what it was – was the only true choice, provided that he made it authentically,

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.840
because it was determined by the values he
chose to accept.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.430
A lot of people think existentialism paints
a pretty bleak picture of the world.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.210
In fact, the French philosopher and novelist
Albert Camus went so far as to say that

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:22.059
the literal meaning of life is whatever you’re
doing that prevents you from killing yourself.

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:26.490
But most existentialists would remind you
that the world, and your life, can have meaning,

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.449
but only if you choose to assign it.

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:32.940
If the world is inherently devoid of purpose, you can choose to imbue it with whatever purpose you want.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.680
So, no one can tell you if your life isn’t
worth anything if you, say, don’t have children,

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.240
or don’t follow a lucrative career path, or achieve whatever standards your parents hold you to.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.860
And this works not just on an individual scale,
but on a global one too.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.800
If the world is going to have any of the things
most of us value

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.339
– like justice and order –
we’re going to have to put it there ourselves.

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:53.749
Because, otherwise, those things wouldn’t
exist.

00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:58.409
So, a worldview that looks bleak to some,
may to others seem almost exhilarating.

00:07:58.409 --> 00:08:03.460
Today I hope you enjoyed as much as I did learning about essentialism and its response: existentialism.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.540
We talked about Jean-Paul Sartre and his ideas about how to find meaning in a meaningless world.
