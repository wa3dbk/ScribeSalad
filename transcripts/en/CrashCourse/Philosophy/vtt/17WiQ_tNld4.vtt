Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.260
In your day-to-day life, you probably assume
a whole bunch of different identities.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.450
You might be a sister to your brother, a daughter
to your parents, a colleague to your co-worker.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.279
A mentor to the kids you teach.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.740
Or you might think of your identity as being based on your interests, your skills, or things like your gender or ethnicity.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.380
Whatever they are, I’ll bet that you think
of your identities as being pretty fixed.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.420
Stable. And you like ‘em that way.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.719
And if that’s the case, I’d like you to meet this guy: 18th century Scottish philosopher David Hume.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.640
Because, he says you’re wrong.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.030
Hume argued that the idea of the self doesn’t
persist over time.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.210
He said there is no you that is the same person
from birth to death.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.340
He said the concept of the self is just an
illusion.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.070
This could be either liberating or terrifying,
depending on how you look at it.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.660
I mean, if you don’t have an identity, you
don’t have to worry about identity theft.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.860
But what does it mean for my understanding of myself, and for the people I love, if there is no single, constant me?

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.900
If that’s the case, then the person I’m married to is literally not the person I fell in love with, or made those vows to.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.160
Which would suggest that I don’t need to
keep those vows, and neither does she.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.080
And what about personal responsibility?

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.320
How can you hold someone accountable for their actions, if they’re not the same person now that they were before?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.360
And how can you be responsible for something
that you did, if you’re always changing?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.860
This is gonna get dicey.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:36.300
[Theme Music]

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.640
If you joined me last time when we talked about personal identity, you’ll remember that we

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.820
considered two main possibilities for what might preserve “you” as the same person over time.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
One approach was the body theory, the sort
of go-to view of things, which holds that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.230
you remain “you” over time, because you
just occupy the same body from birth to death.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.260
And the other was John Locke’s memory theory,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.420
the view that your memories are what makes you the same person over time:

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.500
I’m me, because I remember being me in the
past.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.140
But both of these models have some problems.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.320
No matter how much we want the idea of permanent, persistent selves to be a thing, David Hume said that they just aren’t.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.080
For him, it was really a no-brainer.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.620
If having a certain identity means possessing
the same set of properties, he said, then

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.969
how could anyone really maintain the same
identity from one moment to the next?

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:25.140
I clearly don’t share all the same properties as my childhood self – or even my self before I shaved today –

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.840
so Hume would say that it’s silly to pretend
I’m still me.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.209
But I feel like me.
So what did Hume think was going on?

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.289
Hume said that the so-called “self” is just a bundle of impressions, consisting of a zillion different things –

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:42.999
my body, my mind, emotions, preferences, memories,
even labels that are imposed on me by others.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.320
Think of a box – and say it’s marked “Hank” – and then put in that box everything that makes me who I am.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:55.120
My DNA, mannerisms, political leanings, my glasses, the relationships I have with others, the various roles I hold.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.920
Then, you take away the box.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.020
Hume’s point is, the “self” is just
shorthand for all the junk in the box.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.280
And the fact that there is no box points out that there’s no single underlying thing that holds it all together.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.780
And meanwhile, some of the stuff in the bundle
goes away, and new stuff shows up.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.219
So, if you look at the bundle that is me now,
and compare it with the bundle that my mom

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.819
and dad brought home from the hospital,

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.989
they would be almost completely different.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.219
So Hume said we’re all just ever-changing
bundles of impressions that our minds are

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:23.430
fooled into thinking of as constant,

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.569
because they’re packaged in these fleshy receptacles that basically look the same from one day to the next.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.329
To explore this some more, let’s bounce over to the Thought Bubble for some Flash Philosophy.

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.340
Contemporary British philosopher Derek Parfit, probably after watching a Star Trek marathon, posed this thought experiment.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.080
Imagine a machine that breaks you down atom-by-atom, copies all of that information, and transmits it to Mars, at the speed of light.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.020
Once that information gets to Mars, another machine uses it to re-create you, atom by atom,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.020
using copies of the same organic stuff that
you were composed of here on earth.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.959
The person who wakes up on Mars has all the same memories and personality as you did – and that person thinks it’s you.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.629
So here’s the question – is this space
travel?

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:05.060
Did you travel to Mars?

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.680
Is the transported person really you?

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.499
Or was a new being created that just happens to correspond to you, atom by atom, thought by thought?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.519
Now, consider this: What if a new version of the machine is created, so that now, instead of destroying your body,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:25.340
it can simply be scanned, and all the information can be re-created on Mars, but the you here on earth still exists.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.820
Now did you travel?
Or were you just replicated?

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.820
If you’re here on earth, are you also on
Mars?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.960
Wow…uh, yeah, thanks, Thought Bubble…
I think.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:40.140
Parfit agrees with Hume that there isn’t
such a thing as personal identity over time.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:43.530
So, he says, in either case, you didn’t
travel through space –

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.620
that’s just a new you that shows up on Mars, whether the old you was destroyed or still exists.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.600
And you know what?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.540
Even if you hopped on a spaceship and flew to Mars the old-fashioned way, it’d still be a new you that arrives,

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.540
because you would’ve experienced all sorts
of changes during the trip.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.580
But the thing is, Parfit thought Hume missed
a really important point.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.480
Even though there isn’t a singular you from
birth to death,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.120
Parfit says that each of us has a psychological
connectedness with our selves over time.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.420
Think about your life as being like a piece
of chainmail.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.220
The mesh that is your personal identity is
made up of lots of separate chains,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.600
and those chains intersect at certain points,
to make up the chain mail.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.940
As you follow the timeline of one particular set of links, new links are being created that add to the chain.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.320
And as time passes, the links that are farther
back in your past slowly start to drop off,

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.470
as they lose their psychological connection
to you.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.940
So, when you stopped loving Dora the Explorer,
that link dropped away.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.440
And when you discovered that you totally love
philosophy, a new link was created.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:40.410
But some chains intersect with that other
chain, and they have links that persist for

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.770
a long time, like the love you have for your
parents.

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.590
So Parfit says that, sure, I’m not the same
person that I was in elementary school.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.600
And I won’t be the same person when I die.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.460
I’m not even really the same person I was when I started this sentence, because every experience changes us, at least a little.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.280
But parts of me survive the passage of time, because they’re psychologically connected to my previous selves.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.410
And survival is what’s important, for Parfit.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.540
As long as enough of the elements of you persist,
you see yourself as relevantly the same.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.400
But not for a whole lifetime. Parfit would say none of the you that existed at birth is still around –

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.740
your physical matter is almost all different, and you have no memory of that time, and your preferences have completely changed.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.970
Baby You has not survived. But some of Last
Year You probably has.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.890
And Parfit seems to have hit on an important
insight here.

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.620
Think about what you do when you catch up
with an old friend.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.780
The first thing you do is ask what’s happened
since you last spoke.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.000
What you’re doing, without really thinking about it, is recognizing that you both have changed.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:41.540
If the changes are big, then your friend could
seem like a stranger at first.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:46.800
So, when it’s someone you care about, you take the time to reacquaint yourself with this new person.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.810
Because, you recognize the need to always
know the most updated version of that person.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.470
But the opposite can also happen.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:59.010
Think about that aunt you only see at Christmas, who still pinches your cheek and gives you a new American Girl doll every year.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.470
She probably knew what you loved when you
were 10.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.100
But she doesn’t know the current you.

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:07.040
The version of you she’s shopping for at
Christmas doesn’t exist anymore.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.420
But since you rarely see each other, and you haven’t made the effort to know the new yous,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:17.280
you’re both looking past each other in that painfully awkward way that makes holidays with relatives so special.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.740
So now let’s think back to the question
we discussed earlier –

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.060
if I’m not the same me over time, how do I make sense of promises, obligations, and responsibilities?

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.270
Parfit’s theory gives us an answer! Your
degree of responsibility and obligation corresponds

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:33.970
to your degree of connection to the person
who made the promise or incurred the responsibility.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.920
So, if you were a kindergarten bully who grew
up to be a totally sweet guy who would never

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.530
bully anyone, you don’t need to feel any
guilt.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.030
You’re not that person anymore – you don’t
bear responsibility for his actions.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.640
Likewise, if you and your childhood bestie pinkie-swore to be each other’s maids of honor when you grew up,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.140
but now the two of you have nothing in common,
you’re off the hook for that promise.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.720
Now about those marriage vows?

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.040
Well, a promise that lasts a lifetime doesn’t
really make sense, in Parfit’s view.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:03.560
And there are actually people, using this line of reasoning, who argue that marriage contracts should be temporary,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.620
with the option of renewal – kind of like
a cell phone plan.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:11.560
But others have said that marriage vows can actually stay relevant, even after a lifetime of changes.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.460
Over the years, you and your spouse both change,
and become different people.

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:19.420
But, these thinkers point out, you may be constantly reaffirming the promises you made on your wedding day.

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.540
So, a wedding vow isn’t a promise you made years ago, when you were a completely different person.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.520
It’s a promise you made this morning, when you took out the trash and cleaned up the hairball the cat left on the rug.

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.870
Why is it always on the rug?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.620
So clearly, we’re not talking about Batman, or science fiction, or hypothetical trips to Mars anymore.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:38.660
We’re talking about how philosophy can teach you about yourself, and the people you care about,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:42.240
and how you can continue to know them and
be close to them over time.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.160
Today we continued our exploration of personal
identity, learning about Hume’s bundle theory

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.340
and Parfit’s theory of survival through
psychological connectedness.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.940
Next time, we’re going to address a term
that we’ve been taking for granted throughout

00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:56.040
this whole discussion: person.
