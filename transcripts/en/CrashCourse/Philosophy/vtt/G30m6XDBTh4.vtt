Crash Course Philosophy is brought to you
by Squarespace.

Squarespace: share your passion with the world.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.040
How often do you actually think about the
things you say?

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.780
Like, what you’re literally saying?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.320
That’s a seriously overused word, by the
way -- “literally.”

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.180
A lot of the time, people use it for emphasis
in ways that I consider pretty incorrect.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.880
Like, people will say “I’m literally dying of hunger!” because it’s been a few hours since lunch.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.740
But obviously they are not literally dying
of hunger.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.720
They’re just like hungry.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.340
Unless you’re our old friend Ludwig Wittgenstein, who believed that language had no intrinsic meaning,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.300
literal meaning usually refers to the specific,
accepted meaning of a word.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.600
It’s the intended thing that a word is supposed
to stand for.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.000
So, unless you’re in the advanced stages of malnutrition and are at Death’s Freaking Door, then, no, you’re not literally dying of hunger.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.199
But we all say stuff that like that all the
time!

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.080
I mean, have you ever thought about how many of the things you say that are figures of speech, things that aren’t literally true?

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.620
Those figures of speech have other meanings, and most of the time, they mean stuff that we’d rather not put in literal terms.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.220
Like, we all know what we’re not saying
when we say that someone “has a nice personality.”

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.031
Or if a lady announces she’s going to “powder
her nose.”

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.820
And of course there’s “Netflix and chill,”

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.680
which it turns out has very little to do with,
like, actually watching Netflix.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.820
We’ve already talked about how slippery the idea of meaning can be, as it changes depending on the time, or region, or linguistic community you’re in.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:31.940
But that’s not even considering the fact that people don’t usually mean what they say, because we also speak in idioms, fragments, slang, and metaphors.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.000
Which leads me to the question: how do we
manage to understand each other at all?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.320
[Theme Music]

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.520
When it comes to how we know that something described as “bad” is actually good, or how we know that a reference to Netflix is really about sex,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.260
we can thank 20th century British philosopher
Paul Grice.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.909
He wanted to explain exactly how we can know
what is meant, rather than what is said.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.159
And he described our ability to do this, through
a theory he called conversational implicature.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.300
Grice said, to really understand what goes on when we process meaning, we need to sort out the difference between what is said, and what is implied.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.020
What is said is the actual linguistic content,
the words that come out of the speaker’s mouth.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.380
What is implied contains a whole lot more
than just the words that are spoken.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.980
Implicature combines the actual words we utter,
with the context in which we say them.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.640
And that context can include anything from past shared experiences, to social conventions, to things like facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.940
Now, in order for anyone to have a successful conversation, Grice observed that a few conditions had to be in place.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.380
First, you have to be actually trying to communicate
with someone, and have a successful conversation.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.640
If that’s the case, then Grice said that you’re adhering to what’s known as the cooperative principle.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.720
This means that, whenever there’s ambiguity in what a speaker is saying, the audience should look for the most likely intended meaning of what’s being said, given the context.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:04.200
So, even if the literal words don’t fit into the conversation you’re having, you should try to interpret whatever your interlocutor is saying, so that it makes sense.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.860
Like, if you’re in your sister’s room having an argument, and she says, “there’s the door,” you can assume she’s not just randomly naming house parts.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.220
She’s recommending that you walk through
that door and out of her space.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.220
But the burden of understanding doesn’t
all fall on the audience.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:23.480
Grice also laid out certain maxims, or communicative rules of thumb, which help speakers keep to the cooperative principle.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.360
These maxims fall under four main types – quantity,
quality, relation, and manner.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.280
There are two rules relating to quantity.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.590
First, you should be adequately informative.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.660
When your parents call you up at school, and they ask you how you’ve been, you probably say something along the lines of: “fine.”

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.460
Now, this might be technically accurate, but you’re not giving them the quantity of information they’re looking for.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.260
What they really want to know is, are you going to pass math, and are you remembering to wash your sheets?

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.269
Stuff like that.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.380
Second, we shouldn’t be more informative
than is required.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.740
We’ve all met these people.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.680
When you’re explaining to your teacher that
you missed class because you were sick,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.900
you do not need to provide all of the gruesome
details about the nature of your diarrhea.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.790
I mean, there really is such a thing as too
much information, people.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.670
There are also two quality rules of communication.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.700
First, we shouldn’t say things that we think
are false.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.240
This includes people who are running for elected
office!

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.260
No one should just tell lies!

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.660
The second quality rule cautions us to refrain from making claims for which we we have insufficient evidence.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.519
So if you see your significant other talking
to someone else in the hallway,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:24.540
don’t go around telling everyone that they’re a cheating scumbag without first checking your facts.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.680
Now, this isn’t to say people don’t break these rules all the time; some people lie more than they tell the truth.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.890
But Grice’s point was, violating these rules
hinders successful communication.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.270
Now, the next maxim is the rule of relation,
which tells us to say relevant things.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.180
It’s what keeps us from going on a tear in the middle of the Super Bowl about the home worlds of our favorite members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.560
I’m look at you, Chlorophyll Kid.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.060
And finally, there are four rules about the
manner in which we speak.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.840
First, we should avoid obscure turns of phrase.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.640
After all, this could come off as supercilious
and pedantic,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.620
and might cause your interlocutor to be fractious.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.040
The whole point of a conversation is successful communication, not showing off how big your vocabulary is.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.560
Second, ambiguity should be avoided.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.180
Keep your audience in mind when you use figures
of speech and slang.

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.980
The reason you don’t talk to your grandmother about your bae is because she’s not going to have any idea what you’re talking about.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.240
Third, be brief.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.430
Don’t give a ten minute explanation when
a one minute one will do.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.190
And finally, be orderly.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.790
Remember that time your mom recounted the
recipe for her famous meatloaf from memory?

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.290
And then when you tried to make it, you ended
up with whole onions and raw meat?

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.640
Mom assumed you were going to know that you needed to chop the onions and bake the loaf, but she didn't say that.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.240
So, the rule of orderliness reminds us not
to miss steps when we’re communicating information.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.130
Now, this might sound like a lot of rules,

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.500
but Grice believed that we already follow
these maxims when we engage in conversation.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.770
Because, generally, when we communicate, we
want to be understood.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:55.260
And – here’s the cool part – since everyone understands these unspoken rules, we can violate them from time to time, knowing that other people will get that we’re breaking the rules on purpose.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.620
Why would we do that?

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.120
Well, because deliberately violating a maxim
is a good way to make a communicative point.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.280
This is called flouting a maxim.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.520
We flout the maxim of quality, for example,
when we use sarcasm.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.770
Like, I’m sure that you’ve never experienced
sarcasm before!

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.580
And we flout the maxim of manner when we deliberately use $10 words to confuse or embarrass our interlocutor.

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.980
So, now that we know how to say what we mean without saying what we mean, it’s time to do things!

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.360
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble for some
Flash Philosophy.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.360
In the 1950s, British philosopher J. L. Austin wrote a charming little book called How to Do Things with Words.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.040
And in it, Austin observed that sometimes, words actually have the ability to change the world.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.760
I don’t mean in the way that, like, Martin
Luther King’s words changed the world,

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.940
but in the sense that, in an instant, an act of speech can change a particular fact about the world.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.580
When a wedding officiant says, “I now pronounce you husband and wife,” or “husband and husband,” or “wife and wife,”

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:54.340
that speech-act has the power to actually transform two single individuals into a married couple.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.940
In that same way, parents have the power to determine their child’s name, simply by announcing it.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.020
A president or head of state can create a
state of war, just by declaring it.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.540
And by saying, “I promise,” we create
moral obligations.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.320
We’re verbal animals, and we’ve allowed our reality to be shaped, in a very deep way, by words, and the value that we give them.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:20.400
This isn’t something we think about a lot, but when you stop to reflect on it, it’s kind of incredible that words can actually create a bond, or dissolve it,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.250
or that a speech-act can cause nations to
go to war.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:30.060
But some of these examples require certain conditions to be met, in order for the utterance to work, or, in Austin’s words, to be felicitous.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:37.620
Like, if one of the spouses-to-be at a wedding is underage, or already married, or is a dog, then pronouncing them married won’t make it true.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:44.660
You also need a legally recognized officiant to do the pronouncing, which is also true of declarations of war and in conferring academic degrees.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.240
But in other cases, like making a promise,
or joining a society, or naming a child,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.260
anyone can change the world in this way, simply
with their words.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:58.320
Performative utterances are interesting, because we normally think of sentences as simply conveyors of information.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.400
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.849
It turns out, sometimes, these types of sentences
actually do things.

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:07.200
Today we talked about conversational implicature,
the cooperative principle,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:11.449
and the four main maxims of successful communication, as laid out by Paul Grice.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.510
We also learned about performative utterances.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.450
And I would like to remind you that bananas
are chom choms.

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:20.259
Next time we’ll look at an area where the
philosophy of language and ethics meet,

00:08:20.259 --> 00:08:23.669
by talking about the ways in which the power
of words can cause harm.
