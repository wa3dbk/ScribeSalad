00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.830
Who is The Doctor? Is it this guy?
Or this one? How about him?

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.530
As any good Whovian knows, the answer is yes,
all of them.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.370
But, also, wait: No.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.420
In the show Doctor Who, each incarnation of
The Doctor has a completely different body,

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.280
different mannerisms, likes and dislikes and,
to some extent, memories.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.920
So… how are they all The Doctor?

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.580
Science fiction is great at giving us scenarios to grapple with that seem far-out and only barely possible.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.380
But when you think about it, the issue of Who is Who isn’t that much more clear-cut in real life.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.780
The fact is, you can take the same questions I asked about The Doctor, and ask them about anyone.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.880
Like…me. I mean, are these people any more similar
to each other…than these people?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:01:01.540

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.240
Last time, we talked about identity – or basically, what makes an object the same over time.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.220
And the concept can get more complex when we talk about our own identity, or the identity of others.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.000
When talking about ships or trees, we might be willing to say yeah, ok, that’s just not the same thing it used to be.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.140
But when we’re talking about, say, me!

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.280
I have the strong belief that I’m the same person that mom and dad brought home from the hospital back in 1980.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.420
I’m that same kid that cut his hand open
on that broken flower pot – I have the scar to prove it!

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.780
And there’s some guy in the future who’s still going to be me, even though he’ll be all stooped over,

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.100
and wrinkled, and gray.
At least, I hope.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.560
And you probably think of yourself in the same way – that you’ll keep being the same person, from birth to death.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.479
But, you could argue
– and some have –

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.079
that the only thing that really remains constant
about you your whole life is your name.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.760
And for some of us, even that changes!

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.540
Philosophers have struggled with the issue
of personal identity for a long time,

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.670
trying to find that special something – that
essential property –

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.050
that makes you you, the thing that preserves
your identity through time,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.040
and through all the changes that come with
it.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.040
Let’s take a look at some of ideas they’ve
come up with.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.840
First there’s the Body Theory.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.140
This is sort of the default position that
most people have

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.890
– and the assumption that Doctor Who messes
with so badly.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.480
It says that personal identity persists over time because you remain in the same body from birth to death.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.420
Now, in a sense, that’s true – I don’t know anybody outside of, like, Freaky Friday that’s had a body transplant.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.980
But, it’s not like you consist of all of the same, identical stuff that you had when you were born.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.900
You’ve sloughed off and replaced your outer
layer of skin, for example, hundreds of times so far.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.560
Your red blood cells only live about 4 months
before they’re cycled out.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.080
Even your skeleton is constantly being remodeled.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.550
So, kind of like the Doctor – or the Ship
of Theseus –

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.539
you’re constantly being replaced by new
physical versions of yourself.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.779
And if you are your body, then how much of
you can change until you become a new you?

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.249
Can you get a haircut? What if you lose or
gain a lot of weight?

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.120
Or grow a beard? Or put John Travolta’s
face on your face?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.000
Let’s go over to the Thought Bubble and explore the ideas of our bodies, and ourselves, with some Flash Philosophy!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.719
20th century English moral philosopher Bernard
Williams proposed a thought experiment,

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.109
to make us consider where we think our personal
identity resides.

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.609
It goes something like this:
You and I have been kidnapped by a mad scientist.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.111
He tells us that, tomorrow morning, he’s
going to transfer all of your mental content –

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.000
all of your beliefs, memories, personality,
everything – into my brain.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.190
And then he’s gonna move all of my mental
content into your brain.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.980
Presumably, this is how he earned the title
of mad scientist.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.930
But he also tells us that, after the procedure
is complete

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.109
– and your mental content is in this body,
and my mental content is in yours –

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.790
he’ll give one of the bodies a million dollars,
and the other body will be tortured.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.249
And he’s decided to let you pick which body
gets the torture and which one gets the cash.

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:48.069
What do you decide? Your answer should give you a clue about where you think your identity lies.

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.220
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.680
Now our friend John Locke didn’t cotton to the idea that the most essential aspect of a person is her body.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.400
For Locke, the thing that makes you you is
the non-physical stuff – your consciousness.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.559
But Locke recognized that we don’t maintain a single consciousness over the course of our entire lives.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.040
We go to sleep every day, but, when we wake up, our conscious selves remember who we were the day before.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.600
So Locke posited a Memory Theory of personal
identity.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.540
He believed that your identity persists over time, because you retain memories of yourself at different points,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.620
and each of those memories is connected to
one before it.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.040
Now, we don’t remember every single moment – I mean, do you remember what you ate for lunch last Tuesday?

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.700
But you can probably remember a time when you did remember that – like, say, last Tuesday afternoon.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.020
And if you can remember that version of yourself,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.629
then you’re still connected to the Tuesday-at-lunch
person, through a chain of memory.

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.529
And this process can take us back a lot farther
than last Tuesday.

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.740
Locke said that if you can remember back to
your first day of kindergarten,

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.319
you maintain a memory link to that person.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:50.150
Sure, your Mom also remembers that day, but
no one remembers it from the inside –

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.160
the butterflies in your stomach; the way your new shoes felt stiff after a summer of running barefoot.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.660
That’s your memory, and since it’s yours, you must be the same person who experienced that memory.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.300
The memory theory actually makes a lot of sense, but it’s got some problems of its own.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.200
First off, no one remembers being born.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.380
Now that’s not a bad thing, really – I mean, I imagine none of us would really want to recall that particular experience

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.539
– or the couple of years that we spent after
that, pooping in our pants.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.200
But, if personal identity requires a memory, then none of us became who we are until our first memory,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.840
which means we all lost at least a couple
years at the beginning.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.550
What’s more,
if you’re committed to this view,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.610
you have to accept that people stop being
the same person if they lose their memories.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.970
So, say a person begins to suffer from dementia.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.170
Once he’s lost the ability to remember his
past, does he stop being that person?

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.750
So the memory theory presents problems for
both the beginnings and ends of life,

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.270
but there’s also the issue of false memories.

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.639
Memory, after all, is notoriously tricky.

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.689
We know that a group of eyewitnesses are likely
to recount the same event very differently.

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:51.540
So, how do we know that the memories we have
are accurate?

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.800
And if they’re not – if things didn’t
actually happen the way you remember –

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:57.680
then how do those faulty memories influence
your identity?

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.590
Do they make you a partially fictional person?

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.919
So, at first, Locke’s theory seems to have
some advantages over the Body Theory,

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.379
because consciousness and memory persist through
your body’s physical changes.

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:11.090
But, after just a little interrogation, you
find that memory is pretty tenuous too.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.110
Now, here’s the sixty-four-thousand-Altairian-dollar
question:

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.620
Does any of this really matter?

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.360
Like, who cares if there’s a you that persists
from your birth to your death?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:24.300
Maybe all you feel like you need to know is that your self has to go to work and pay bills, and that’s plenty.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.389
But the matter of personal identity isn’t
just a conceptual puzzle.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.590
It’s also deeply important when you’re
thinking about how you should live your life.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.569
For example, do you believe that you have
obligations to particular people in your life?

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:40.460
Well, if those people don’t persist as distinct identities, then your obligations might not either.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.780
And the same goes for how people think about
you.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.520
Your boss only has to give you the raise she
promised you,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.090
if each of you remains the same person you
were when she made the promise.

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.660
In fact, if next Friday, you’re not the same person anymore, she doesn’t even have to pay you!

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.300
The fact is, we’ve all built our lives and
our society on the expectations that

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.960
individuals will continue to be who they are, unchanged – and those people expect the same thing out of you.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.920
So now you can see…this really is your problem.
You expect a paycheck.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.939
You expect people to keep their promises.

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:13.379
But as we learned back with Clifford and James
and epistemic responsibility,

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.759
you don’t just get to believe things without
reasons.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.700
So if you think you deserve that paycheck,
you need to figure out why.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:20.380
Today we talked about personal identity.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.039
We considered the two main answers people give to the question of where your identity lies –

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:28.539
in your body, or in the connected memories
of your consciousness.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.280
We found some pretty significant problems
with each of them,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.920
and then we talked about why the persistence of identity is actually something you should care about!

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:42.420
Next time, we’ll return to this issue, to talk about whether you really need the idea of a “you” that persists over time.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.060
If you still exist then, I hope you join me.
