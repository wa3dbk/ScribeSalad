Nothing gets people talking like proving the existence of God -- just look at the comments on our last video.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.160
And that is what Anselm of Canterbury did.
He claimed, in the 11th century,

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.460
to have come up with deductive proof of God’s existence, through what we now know as the ontological argument.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.060
And, if there was such a thing as a social
network of medieval Christian philosophers

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.050
back then, it was positively abuzz with the
news. For a long time. Because, almost 200

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.540
years later, Italian theologian and philosopher
Thomas Aquinas encountered Anselm’s argument.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.180
But, like many others, he just didn’t buy
it.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.440
Aquinas did believe in God. It was just that,
as a philosopher, he felt that it was important

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.820
to have evidence for your beliefs. He knew
that if he was going to dismiss Anselm’s

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.270
argument, he’d need to come up with something
better. So, he set out to construct five arguments

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.360
that would prove God’s existence, once and
for all.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.160
Yeah, five. Apparently, he was concerned one
wasn’t going to do it, so he figured that,

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.400
out of five, one was bound to stick.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.390
His first four arguments are known together
as the cosmological arguments, as they seek

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.880
to prove God’s existence through what he
argued were necessary facts about the universe.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.080
So, in keeping with the method that we discussed
in our very first episode, we’re going to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.420
examine these first four arguments of Thomas
Aquinas -- and really try to understand them.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.220
And then we’ll consider their merits…
...and their weaknesses.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:30.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.200
Maybe the most striking thing about the cosmological
arguments of Aquinas, at least to modern eyes,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.229
is that some of them are firmly based in the
natural world. Even though he lived in a pretty

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.780
unscientific time, Aquinas argued for the
existence of God through his understanding

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.130
of science, and with the help of what he thought
was physical evidence.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.310
For example, the first of his cosmological
arguments is known as the Argument from Motion.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.150
In it, Aquinas observed that we currently
live in a world in which things are moving.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.119
And he also observed that movement is caused
by movers -- things that cause motion. Aquinas

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.200
was convinced that everything that’s moving
must have been set into motion by something

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.480
else that was moving. By this logic, something
must have started the motion in the first place.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.280
Otherwise, you’d be stuck in a philosophical
quandary known as an infinite regress.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.720
You get an infinite regress when, in a chain of
reasoning, the evidence for each point along

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.330
the chain relies on the existence of something
that came before it, which in turn relies

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.350
on something even further back, and so on,
with no starting point.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.220
Basically, Aquinas thought the very idea of
infinite regress was absurd, logically impossible.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.040
Because, it implied that any given series
of events began with…nothing. Or, more accurately,

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.060
never really began. Instead, it could have
been going on forever.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.080
In the case of physical motion, Aquinas wanted
to trace the cause of the movement he saw

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.640
in the world all the way back to its beginning.
And he figured there MUST have been a beginning.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.830
Otherwise, for him, it would be like watching
these blocks fall, and being told that nothing

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.670
ever pushed over the first block. Instead,
they had always been falling down forever,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.860
backward into eternity. There must have been
a time when nothing was in motion, Aquinas

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.540
thought, and there also must’ve been a static
being that started the motion. And that being,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.790
according to Aquinas, is God – the Unmoved
Mover.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.550
So his Argument From Motion ran something
like this:

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.030
Objects are in motion
Everything in motion was put into motion by

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.630
something else
There can’t be an infinite regress of movers

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.300
So there must have been a first mover, itself
unmoved, and that is God

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.430
Now, the second cosmological argument
of Aquinas was a lot like his first one.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.600
Here, he proposed the Argument from Causation, and it, too, sets out to avoid the problem of an infinite regress.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.140
But instead of it explaining the motion of
objects, it set out to explain causes

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.670
and effects, in general, all over the universe.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.440
The argument went along these lines:
Some things are caused

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.780
Anything that’s caused has to be caused
by something else (since nothing causes itself)

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.280
There can’t be an infinite regress of causes

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.900
So there must have been a first causer,
itself uncaused, and that is God

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.879
Just like with the Argument from Motion, the
point here is pretty simple: Effects have causes.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.259
If you think about how you wound up watching this
video, you can trace the line of causation back,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
from moment to moment. If you think about it long enough, you can probably go pretty far back.

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:05.659
But Aquinas said, again: It can’t go back
forever. There had to be a First Thing that

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.560
started off the chain of causes and effects.
And that Thing is God.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.060
Argument number three was the Argument from
Contingency. And we should step back and get

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.299
a little background for this one. In philosophy,
we often distinguish between necessary beings

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.599
and contingent beings. A contingent being is,
simply put, any being that could have not existed.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.460
That includes you. Sure, you
do exist, but you could not have.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.420
If you had never been born, the world would go on. And
yes, things would be different – we’ve

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.380
all seen It’s A Wonderful Life – but the
world would go on. Instead, your existence

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.600
is merely contingent on the existence of other
things. In your case, you only exist because

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.080
a certain sperm met a certain egg and swapped
some genetic information. You’re basically a fluke.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.270
But what does that have to do with God? Well,
again, Aquinas believed that there had to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.840
be something that prevented an infinite regress
of contingency. That would mean that the contingency

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.160
on which everything existed would just keep
going back in time. And we can’t have a

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.860
world where everything is contingent, Aquinas
said, because then -- by definition -- it

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.260
all could easily have never existed. So he
needed at least one necessary being –

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.400
a being that has always existed, that always
will exist, and that can’t not exist, in

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.030
order to get everything going. And that necessary
being is God.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.230
Aquinas spelled out the reasoning of his Argument
from Contingency this way:

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:18.880
There are contingent things
Contingent things can cause other contingent

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.800
things, but there can’t only be contingent
things

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.830
Because that would mean that there’s an
infinite regress of contingency, and a possibility

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.870
that nothing might have existed
An infinite regress is impossible

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.930
So there must be at least one necessary thing,
and that is God

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.229
Let that marinate in your brain for a minute
while unpack the next argument.

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.620
This one is built on the idea that we simply need a measuring stick in order to understand the value of things.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.020
Good/bad, big/small, hot/cold – none of
these concepts can exist in isolation.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.759
If you go out for a walk and you see an animal,
and it’s like this big, that animal would

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:55.350
be on the small side if it turned out to be
a dog. But if it were a rat, that would be HUGE.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.960
How do we know? Because we gauge the size
of things in terms of other things.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.120
The same idea applies to more abstract concepts, like your grades. How do we know that an A is good?

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.120
Because it’s at the top -- we know that there are grades lower than an A, but nothing higher.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.150
And Aquinas thought that all of our value
concepts would just be floating randomly in

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.930
space if there weren’t some anchor – something
that defined the value of everything else,

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.170
by being perfect – and that, again, is God.

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.120
This is how Aquinas developed Number four,
known as Argument from Degrees.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.449
Properties come in degrees
In order for there to be degrees of perfection,

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:30.979
there must be something perfect against which
everything else is measured

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.960
God is the pinnacle of perfection

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.610
Ok, so we’ve considered Aquinas’ four
cosmological arguments. But remember, that’s

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.650
only step one. The next, and equally important
step in philosophy, is critical evaluation.

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:42.920
So what do we make of ‘em?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.660
As philosophers, if you think an argument
is flawed, it’s your job to try and figure out why.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.200
And by and large, philosophers – theists
and atheists alike – have been relatively

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.350
unimpressed by these four, having found many
problems in them.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.780
For one thing, these arguments don’t seem
to establish the existence of any particular god.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.580
Even if the arguments are correct, it
doesn’t look like Aquinas gets us to the

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.979
personal, loving God that many people pray
to. Instead, we’re left with unmoved movers

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:09.600
and uncaused causers who seem to have little
in common with the God of Abraham, Isaac,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.420
and Jacob ... the God who feels emotions, and
cares about his creation, and answers prayers.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.819
Basically, this objection says that
Aquinas’ god is so far removed from the

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:20.910
god that theists actually believe in, that
it doesn’t help anything.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.720
But maybe you’re happy just believing
someone’s out there. That’s fine.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.860
But then how about multiple someones?

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.500
Because – guess what – Aquinas’ arguments
don’t rule out polytheism. There’s nothing

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.900
in any of his arguments to prove that God
isn’t actually, like, a committee. Aquinas’

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.979
cosmological arguments also don’t prove
the existence of a sentient God. So, it might

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.130
be an old guy with a beard. It might be six
old guys with beards. But it also might be

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.569
an egg, or a turtle, or just a big block of
stone.

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.360
These observations have made some philosophers
uncomfortable with Aquinas’ ultimate conclusion.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.069
But there are two objections that are thought
by some to be real nails in its coffin.

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.970
The first is simply that Aquinas was wrong
in his insistence that there can’t be an

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.630
infinite regress of anything. Aquinas takes
it as a given that there had to be a starting

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.970
point for everything -- whether it’s the
movement of objects, or causes and effects,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:11.040
or contingent beings being created. But it’s
unclear that this is true, or why it has to be true.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:15.380
If infinite regress can be possible, then
Aquinas’ first two arguments fall apart.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.830
But perhaps the most significant charge made
against Aquinas’ arguments is that they’re

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:22.250
self-defeating -- that is, they actually prove
themselves wrong.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.560
For example: If Aquinas is right that everything
must have been put in motion by something else,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.200
and everything must have a cause other
than itself, then it seems that God should

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.759
be subject to those same stipulations. And
if God is somehow exempt from those rules,

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:38.789
then why couldn’t other things be exempt
from them too? If they can exist without God

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:42.749
being responsible them, then we don’t need
God to establish things in the first place.

00:08:42.749 --> 00:08:44.709
All right, I’ve given you a lot to think
about.

00:08:44.709 --> 00:08:48.209
So before we close, let’s pause and remind
ourselves about a couple of things.

00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:52.920
First, you can accept a conclusion but reject
an argument. So you might agree with Aquinas

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:55.640
that God exists, but think none of his arguments
prove it.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.960
Second, if you disagree with an argument,
you don’t get to just say, “yeah, you’re wrong.”

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.160
You have to give a counterargument. What did Aquinas get wrong, and how can you do better?

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.940
Why are your reasons superior to his?
Remember, philosophy is a dialectic.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:13.660
Yes, Aquinas has been dead for centuries. But he started a conversation. And you get to participate

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.860
in that when you engage with his arguments, and offer your own, either in an effort to help him out

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.420
– by fixing flaws in his arguments while preserving his conclusion – or by refuting his entire project.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.280
This is what it means to do philosophy – to engage with arguments about stuff that matters.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.020
And whether or not there’s a God seems to matter quite a bit, particularly in the lives of theists.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.400
Today we’ve learned about cosmological arguments,
and considered four of them. Next time, we’ll

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:40.710
look at Aquinas’ fifth argument, the teleological
argument.
