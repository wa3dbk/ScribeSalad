00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.240
Mel Gibson did it, Tom Cruise nearly busted
Oprah's couch doing it, and Kanye pretty much

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.390
has owned it for years now.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.070
I'm talking about expressing too much emotion,
usually in public and in weird and often insensitive

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.070
ways.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.350
Such regrettable outbursts are not unique
to celebrities, of course, and they can be

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.510
enough to make us think of our emotions as
irrational.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.600
But they're not... well, not usually.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.529
When they're not getting the better of us,
they have work to do.

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.640
Part of their job is to provide the energy
and motivation that lets us meet our goals

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.120
and our needs, and despite the occasional
public fail, they often improve our performance

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.270
in a given situation.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.840
So emotions play an important role in how
we think and behave.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.910
Of course, when they blow up and someone screams
at a flight attendant or punches a paparazzo

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.580
or jumps on stage and grabs the mic away from
a teenager in the middle of her acceptance

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.830
speech to say that someone else deserve the
honor more - all hail Beyoncé - you're kind

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.160
of off the rails of normal emotional function.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.590
Okay, definition time, general idea.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.970
Emotion is a mind and body's integrated response
to a stimulus of some kind.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.300
Emotions involve physiological arousal, expressive
behaviors and conscious experience.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.420
These can be short flashes or long, lingering
responses, and they can be very clear or very

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.420
confusing.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.000
Say, you're walking home at night and you
hear footsteps behind you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.179
Physiological arousal occurs in the form of
your heart pounding, your expressive behaviors

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.030
could be like quickening your pace or moving
toward a streetlight, and your conscious experience

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.689
may include thinking "Oh I'm...

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.619
I'm... gonna get mugged now?

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.799
Is this like a werewolf behind me?"

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.359
Feeling, you know, fear and panic.

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.479
We know those three pieces are there, but
psychologists are still puzzling out exactly

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.479
how they fit together.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.539
How do thinking and feeling interact?

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.820
Which one comes first?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.969
And do these bodily reactions - the pounding
heart, the need to pee, the sweaty palms - come

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:52.570
as a result of the thought "I"m scared", or
did my tweaking out body trigger the thought

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.570
in my brain?

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.009
These are just some of the questions that
we'll be looking at in this messy, exhilarating,

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.649
and terrifying world of emotions - no one
gets out unscathed.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.170
[Intro]

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.900
Our emotions represent and construct a big
part of who we are.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.750
Think of how boring we would be - how boring
the world would be without joy, embarrassment,

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.170
heartache, or fear.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.620
What would motivate us to make decisions,
be cautious, or bold, or strive to understand

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620
each other?

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.170
What would keep our humanity intact?

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.540
Where would punk rock come from?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.810
No doubt, we need our emotions, but how do
they work?

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.510
Well, like, apparently everything in psychology,
there are a few different theories.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.010
In the late 1800s, pioneering American psychologist
William James suggested that our feelings

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:50.041
follow our bodily reactions to external situations;
that, for example, you feel sad because you

00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.300
are crying, or you're scared because you're
shaking like a leaf.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.070
This idea was also proposed by Danish psychologist
Carl Lange, and so, this concept that physiological

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.510
arousal precedes emotion is called the James-Lange
theory.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.840
But American physiologist Walter Cannon wasn't
feeling it.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.890
He thought that too many of the body's reactions
were too similar: a racing heart, fluttering

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.770
stomach, and sweaty hands could be attributed
to passion, fear, excitement, or anger.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.260
So how could they cause such different emotions?

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.650
His colleague, Philip Bard, agreed, concluding
that bodily responses and emotions occur separately,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.920
but simultaneously - and this idea is the
base of the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.410
In other words, a racing heart doesn't cause
fear, nor does the feeling of fear result

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.940
in a racing heart, rather, both things just
happen together.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.960
Today, most psychologists agree that our emotions
are also tangled up with our cognition: whether

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.090
or not we're afraid of a dog on the sidewalk
depends a lot on whether we're interpreting

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.060
the animal's behavior as threatening or friendly,
probably also, what our personal history with

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.060
dogs is.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.900
In the 1960s, American psychologist Stanley
Schachter and Jerome Singer interpreted this

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.340
idea that cognition can define emotion, into
what they called their "two-factor theory".

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.390
They believed that to experience emotion,
you must both fear physiological arousal,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.690
and cognitively label that arousal.

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.260
And again, please remember that in psychology,
arousal is different from how you're used

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.490
to using it.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.509
Here, arousal can be thought of as activation
or stress, or even energy - an increase in

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:22.360
reactivity or wakefulness that primes us for
some kind of action.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.509
So sometimes, arousal can spill over from
one event to the next: say you just watched

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.300
a heated soccer match, and you're all revved
up, and someone looks at you funny.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.139
Suddenly, you might label that lingering arousal
as anger, and the next thing you know, the

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:37.970
whole stadium is one big rioting aggro chain
reaction.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.020
Schachter and Singer examine this so-called
"spillover effect" with an experiment that

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.629
involved an usual combination of college guys
and drugs.

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:48.650
First, they injected a bunch of college guys
with the hormone epinephrine.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.729
This is basically adrenaline, and as you yourself
have probably experienced, it induces a level

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.610
of physiological activation that can go any
number of ways emotionally.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.469
But then they threw a curve ball - some of
the subjects were told to expect symptoms

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:06.080
of feeling all revved up, while others were
told the injection wouldn't produce any effects

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.080
at all.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.250
Then, after being injected, each subject was
left in a waiting room, and with them in the

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.520
room was an actor, pretending to wait as well,
and acting either all jerky and irritated,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.389
or super happy and euphoric.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.689
So the dude's just sitting there, jacked up
on this hormone, and his heart is racing,

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.360
and his cheeks are all flushed, and in the
case where the subject was told not to expect

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.550
the effects, the study found that the guy
would actually adopt the emotion of the actor

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.770
in the room, becoming happy or testy, depending
on how the person was acting.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.819
His body was having a physiological response
to the hormone, but he ended up effectively

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:41.280
deciding which emotion he was feeling.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.949
But, if the subject had been told that the
injection would make him feel all pumped up,

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.099
he'd actually report very little emotion,
just because he was blaming that racing heart

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:53.749
and flushed face on the drug, not a particular
state of mind.

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:58.539
So in terms of the two-factor theory, the
cause of physiological arousal had to be identified

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.309
before a person could feel and label the response
as a particular emotion.

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:06.861
To Schachter, Singer, and their disciples,
this meant that arousal spurs emotion, but

00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:08.770
cognition directs it.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.129
And yet, some researchers like Polish-born
American psychologist Robert Zajonc, contend

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:18.860
that all emotions are the result of just putting
a name to our arousal - he suggests that many

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.550
of our emotional reactions occur separately,
or even before our cognition kicks in.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.400
If you hear a sudden crash outside your window,
you'll automatically react with a jolt before

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.219
your brain has the chance to think, "Gee,
what was that crazy noise?

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:32.629
Should I feel startled?"

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:36.580
This is, in part, because when it comes to
emotions, it's thought that our brains process

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:42.860
sensory input by two different kinds of roots
- top-down, or bottom-up approaches, and neuroscientists

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.620
can actually chart these two pathways in action.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.039
Some bigger, more complex feelings, like love
and hatred take what we call the "high-road."

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.699
Say, you read a love letter from your sweetie.

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:57.800
You can pin that mushy feeling in your heart
to the sensory stimulus of reading traveling

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.949
from your eyes all the way through your thalamus
to your brain's cortex.

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:05.460
There, it can be analyzed by means of your
cognitive process, perhaps, consciously, perhaps

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:10.719
implicitly - and labelled with, like, "Aw,
so sweet," at which point, it heads to your

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:14.400
limbic system, the central brain region that
drives emotion, motivation.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.270
At that point, you respond with all the warm-fuzzies.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.650
Other emotions, like simple likes, aversions,
and fears, don't have to involve actual thinking,

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:24.719
and take a sort of "low-road" neural path.

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.930
Like, that crash outside, or a baseball flying
at your head.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.221
Such "jump-out-of-your-chair" stimuli bypass
the cortex and zip right from the ear or the

00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:35.009
eye to the amygdala in the limbic system.

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:39.710
It's a knee-jerk reaction that allows us to
react quickly, often in the face of potential

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.710
danger.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.550
In other words, that slower, high-road cortex
route allows thinking about feeling, while

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:48.409
the quick low-road shortcut allows instant
emotional reaction.

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:52.090
The stomach flip that happens when you see
your ex, or the ten thousand pee breaks you

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.629
gotta take before you give a speech, or your
heart racing after a really good kiss - it's

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:00.710
hard to argue with the fact that we often
feel emotions with our bodies as much as with

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.710
our brains.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.309
And you can thank your autonomic nervous system
the next time you're freaking out or trying

00:08:05.309 --> 00:08:06.469
to calm yourself down.

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:10.310
Perhaps, you recall when we talked about the
roles of the sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:12.099
branches of our autonomic nervous system.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:16.659
The sympathetic division is what arouses you
in a crisis - it makes you hyper aware, makes

00:08:16.659 --> 00:08:21.229
your heart rate and breathing increase, spikes
your blood sugar for extra energy - all that

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:22.229
fun stuff.

00:08:22.229 --> 00:08:26.400
It's like a pit crew readying you for action,
and once it's done its job and the danger

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.460
has passed, the parasympathetic division steps
in and talks you back down from the edge,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:35.800
slowing down your heart and breathing rates,
and shutting off those stress hormones.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.180
Generally, rubbing your back and being all,
"Everything's gonna be okay, baby."

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:43.000
What you need is the right degree of arousal
for the situation: for example, if you're

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.709
navigating through fast moving traffic in
an unfamiliar city, you wanna hit the sweet

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:51.079
spot of optimal arousal that allows you to
focus your attention without either freaking

00:08:51.079 --> 00:08:53.160
out or getting all mellow and sleepy.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:57.320
Like we said before, there's a lot of overlap
in the symptoms of different emotions.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.920
If you monitor the heart rate, breathing,
and perspiration of a group of people who

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.940
are watching three different movies, you probably
couldn't tell who was watching the grisly

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:08.500
horror movie, an angry fight, or a hot sex
scene.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.380
Fear, anger, and sexual arousal often deliver
some of the same biological signals.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:18.290
But those emotions certainly feel different
to the people experiencing them, just as they

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:21.620
usually look different to others observing
their expressions.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.130
And though differences in emotion can appear
subtle, or even undetectable on brain scans,

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.700
many of them do show distinctive patterns.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.310
For most people, positive feelings tend to
show more activity in the left frontal lobe,

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:35.889
while negative ones show up more in the right
frontal lobe.

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:40.580
And someone who's very afraid will show increased
activity in the amygdala, our more primal

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.149
emotional center.

00:09:42.149 --> 00:09:46.910
Emotions are fascinating things that drive
us to do all sorts of brilliant and weird

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.910
stuff.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.540
Understanding them and being able to read
them both in yourself and others is vital

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.910
if you wanna make it through even an average
day.

00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:00.800
But misreading your emotions or someone else's
can be confusing - even dangerous - and it's

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.800
just one of the things that we'll be looking
at next week.

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:07.650
Today, you learned about what emotions are,
how they work, and why we need them.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:13.370
We talked about the James-Lange, Cannon-Bard,
Schachter &amp; Singer, and Zajonc theories, and

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.730
we also looked at the relationship between
cognition and emotion, and how the autonomic

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.190
nervous system mobilizes emotion.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.620
