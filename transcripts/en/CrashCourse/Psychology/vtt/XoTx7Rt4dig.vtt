00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.820
Let me tell you about Robber's Cave. In 1954,
a group of 11 boys, all about 12 years old,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.619
were invited to a special summer camp in the
deep woods of southeastern Oklahoma, at a

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:13.619
place called Robber's Cave State Park. None
of the boys knew each other, although they

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.060
all came from similar backgrounds. They spent
their days bonding over things like games

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.390
and swimming and treasure hunts, and in no
time, they formed a tight friendly group.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.980
They even came up with a name for themselves:
the Rattlers.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.429
But soon they began to notice something. No,
not a guy in the woods with a hockey mask,

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.690
there was another group of boys also 11 of
them, also the same age, that had been staying

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.310
at the other end of the park the whole time.
The Rattlers never interacted with these other

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.650
boys, so they didn't know that those kids
were also spending time bonding over games

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.030
and swimming and treasure hunts, and that
they'd come up with a name for themselves,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.920
too: the Eagles. But the Rattlers didn't like
the look of the Eagles, oh, no, they didn't

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.030
like them using their baseball diamond or
their dining hall.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.120
And the feeling was mutual. It didn't take
long for each group to start complaining to

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.260
the camp's counselors about the other gang,
and eventually, they both said that they wanted

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.390
to set up a contest to determine once and
for all which group was better. The counselors

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.210
were only too happy to comply, because as
I'm sure you've figured out by now, those

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.040
counselors were actually researchers.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.270
The man who set up what would be remembered
as the Robber's Cave Experiment was Turkish

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.490
American social psychologist Muzafer Sherif.
He was interested in what it would take for

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.810
rivals to overcome their differences and resolve
their conflicts. Specifically, Sherif wanted

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.580
to test something called Realistic Conflict
Theory. He hypothesized that conflict happens

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.060
when you combine negative prejudices with
competition over resources, and the boys at

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.010
Robber's Cave were well on their way to proving
him right.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.210
Over the next couple of days, the Rattlers
and the Eagles competed against each other

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.630
for prizes in a series of games, like tug-of-war
and foot races, and soon, what started as

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.060
your basic trash talking and taunting and
name-calling morphed into fist-fights, thefts,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.100
and raids on each others' cabins. But then
their dynamics changed or were changed for them.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.380
After the games were over, the researchers
integrated the groups and gave the kids shared

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.119
goals that they could only achieve through
cooperation. The tide quickly turned. All

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.499
22 boys worked together to move a stalled
truck that was carrying their food, they took

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:15.219
care of a partially felled tree that was deemed
a danger to the camp, they collaborated in

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:20.299
setting up tents, even though they weren't
given complete sets of equipment. While isolation

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.419
and competition made enemies of the strangers, shared
goals and cooperation turned enemies into friends.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.460
Over the past 39 weeks, we've learned a lot
about ourselves, our emotions and our personalities,

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.549
how our minds can get sick, how we can help
them get well again, why we can do vicious

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.299
things and then turn around and act like heroes.
So maybe it's fitting that we wrap up this

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.099
course by looking at a couple of opposing
forces that some consider the very definition

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.810
of human nature: aggression and altruism.
Conflict and cooperation. You might think

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.390
of it as the psychology of war and peace, or simply, 
what we can all learn from a bunch of 12 year olds.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.359
In psychology, aggression is defined as "behavior
intended to hurt or destroy someone, something,

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:17.400
or even yourself." People aggress, as psychologists
say, in all kinds of ways, verbally, emotionally,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.980
and physically, and for lots of different
reasons: out of anger, to assert dominance,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.880
or as a response to fear. But that's just
a glimpse into why someone might become aggressive.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.359
Where does the aggression actually come from?

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.419
Like a lot of behaviors we've talked about
it, it seems to emerge from that familiar

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:37.469
combination of biological factors, like genetic,
neurological, and biochemical influences,

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:42.180
and our environment and experience. In terms
of genetic influences, studies of twins, and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.359
yes, Crash Course Psychology might have been
called Crash Course Studies of Twins, showed

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.489
that if one identical twin has a violent temper,
often the other one does, too, but fraternal

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.639
twins are much less likely to be so similar.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.569
Neurologically speaking, no single area of
the brain controls aggression, but certain

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.249
areas like the limbic system do appear to
facilitate it. Research on violence and criminality

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.400
has also revealed a link between aggression
and diminished activity in the frontal lobes,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.730
which play a vital role in impulse control.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.779
And finally, our aggressiveness can be influenced
by our own biochemistry, hormones like testosterone

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.769
and glucocorticoids and pheromones have all
been implicated in animal models of aggression.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.759
It's a little trickier in humans, it's a lot
trickier in humans, but it's highly likely

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:24.120
that our hormones are intimately linked with
feeling and showing aggression.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.580
Obviously, aggression isn't just about biology.
Psychological and cultural factors also play

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:33.690
an important role, as does the power of the
situation. For example, there's the Frustration-Aggression

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.530
Hypothesis, the simple idea that people become
aggressive when they're blocked from reaching

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.919
a goal. To demonstrate, consider the not-very
aggressive sport of baseball. There's a study

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.879
that analyzed 44 years worth of baseball stats,
and focused on the more than 27,000 incidents

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.680
when a pitcher hit a batter with a ball. It
turned out that this was most likely to occur

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.460
if the pitcher was frustrated by a recent
home run or if one of his own teammates had

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.180
been hit by a pitch in the previous inning.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.940
But we also learn aggression by watching others.
Like, if you grew up watching your parents

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.949
throw popcorn and jeering lewdly at their
most hated soccer team, you might have learned

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.800
something from their behavior. So combine
all of those biological factors and funnel

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.810
them through a particular person with a particular
history in a particular situation, and you

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.500
can begin to see how aggression can have many
roots that grow together.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.430
Thankfully, though, humans are more than their
bad tempers. While some things in people will

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.500
leave us annoyed and angry, others breed friendship
and affection. So yes, there are positive

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.080
topics in social psychology, like altruism,
our selfless, even self-sacrificing regard

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.379
for the welfare of others. This could be something
as simple as jumpstarting a stranger's car

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.430
or as heroic as running into a burning building
to save someone. But if being altruistic is

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.629
so awesome, why aren't we all that way all
the time? Or maybe the better question is,

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:48.550
why do we ever do anything selfless, like,
what's in it for us?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.689
In the late 1960s, social psychologists Bibb
Latane and John Darley conducted a series

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.580
of experiments examining when and why we help
others. In one experiment, they placed a subject

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.090
in a room, sometimes alone, sometimes with
two other subjects, and sometimes with two

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.669
actors posing as subjects. Then, they simulated
an emergency by filling the room with smoke

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.699
and waited to see if the subject would do
anything to alert the others or help themselves.

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:16.550
If the subject was alone, they'd report the
smoke 75% of the time. But subjects in a group

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.500
of three only spoke up 38% of the time. And
when they were stuck in the room with two

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.810
oblivious actors, only 10% of the participants
said anything to the others. Darley and Latane

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.639
found that people typically helped others
only if they noticed the incident, interpreted

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.319
it as an emergency, and then finally, assumed
responsibility, and all of these things were

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.960
much more likely to occur if a person was
alone, while the presence of others deterred

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.169
the person from helping.

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:45.949
This kind of diffusion of responsibility referred
to as the bystander effect, can weaken our

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.219
instinct for altruism. The bystander effect
is a bit like the concept of social loafing

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.080
that we talked about. If you're around other
people, it's easier to think that someone

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.159
else is going to pick up the slack or in this
case, come to the rescue.

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:01.289
When people do decide to help others, they
may do it for a number of reasons. One perspective

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.210
is that we tend to help others mainly out
of self-interest. By this thinking, helping

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.030
really isn't altruistic at all, and instead,
our actions boil down to a sort of cost-benefit

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.110
analysis. Like, maybe we'd turn in a lost
wallet because we're hoping for a reward or

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.139
we pitch in on a project at work because we
think we'll get recognized and promoted by

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:22.520
our bosses. Social psychologists contextualize
these kinds of examples in the broader theory

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.860
of social exchange. When it comes to doing
things for other people, we're always trying

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:30.210
to maximize our personal rewards while minimizing
our costs. But social exchange doesn't have

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:33.930
to be as selfish as that, it can also mean
that we act altruistically because we expect

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.979
that the people we help will go on to help
others, so if we give someone a hand changing

00:07:37.979 --> 00:07:42.009
a tire, maybe they'll stop next time they
see someone else, maybe even us, broken down

00:07:42.009 --> 00:07:45.770
on the side of the road. You might know this
concept, sometimes it's called the norm of

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.159
reciprocity, sometimes it's called paying
it forward.

00:07:48.159 --> 00:07:52.129
And then there's the social responsibility
norm, which is the simple expectation that

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:57.219
people will help those who depend on them,
like any parent can expect to give more help

00:07:57.219 --> 00:08:01.449
than they're going to receive from young children.
That's just part of being a parent. Naturally,

00:08:01.449 --> 00:08:06.210
the world would be a delightful place if altruism
were the standard for human behavior, but

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.789
then, psychology wouldn't be nearly so interesting.

00:08:08.789 --> 00:08:14.340
In some ways, you might say that what fuels
conflict is the opposite of altruism: self-interest.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.669
Social psychologists view conflict as any
perceived incompatibility of actions, goals,

00:08:18.669 --> 00:08:24.050
or ideas. That could mean two nations fighting
over a border, sparring religious or political

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.180
groups, or you and your boo fighting over
whose turn it is to do the dishes.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.469
And in a weird conundrum of human behavior
a lot of conflicts arise from what psychologists

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:35.669
call "a social trap," where people act in
their own short term self-interest, even though

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:40.010
it takes a toll on the larger group and on
themselves over the long-term. You see this

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:43.460
kind of thing all the time on an individual
scale, like in a crime movie, when a criminal

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.890
just betrays all of his criminal friends to
get the big payout, it doesn't turn out very

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:51.830
well for him in the end. But on a larger scale,
you can find social traps taking their toll

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.610
on the environment, like when we poach elephants
to sell their ivory or cut down old growth

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.630
forests to make a quick buck in the lumber
market. Either way, when self-interest succeeds

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:05.330
in wrecking the collective interest by, say,
depleting some limited resource, it becomes

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.810
easy to start viewing our neighbors as competitors,
taking us right back to the ingroup vs. outgroup

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.670
mindset that we all know causes big problems.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.540
So as long as there's self interest, there's
gonna be conflict.

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:21.120
But before you get all down on humanity, remember
those Robber's Cave boys. They were ready

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.640
to go full-on Lord of the Flies before shared
goals forced them to cooperate and ultimately,

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.640
make peace. The power of cooperation to make
friends of former enemies is one of the most

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.640
hopeful areas of psychological research. If
greed and self-interest can destroy the world,

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.770
perhaps cooperation can save it.

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.920
Today, you learned about the Robber's Cave
experiment and what it taught us about realistic

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:47.590
conflict theory and how shared goals can overcome
conflict. We looked at the physical and environmental

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.720
triggers of aggression, and the frustration-aggression
hypothesis. You also learned about altruism,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.820
the bystander effect, and when we are more
or less likely to help a person in need, and

00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.060
also about the social exchange theory, the
reciprocity norm, the social responsibility

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:03.520
norm, and social traps.
