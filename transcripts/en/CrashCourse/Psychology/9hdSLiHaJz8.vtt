00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.500
You've probably heard this story.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.129
Aron Ralston was out climbing in Utah's Bluejohn
Canyon when a giant rock shifted under his

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.940
feet, and he fell, pinning his right arm to
the canyon wall. He was stuck, and worse,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.660
he hadn't told anyone where we was going.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.030
For the next five days, Ralston tried to move
and chip away at the rock. He ate his remaining

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.619
food, drank the last of his water. Eventually
he drank his own urine, and started videotaping

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.250
his goodbyes.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.150
But then something happened. Ralston had a
dream. He saw himself as a father, picking

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.289
up his son, and with that vision, an overpowering
will to survive kicked in. He broke his arm

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.679
bones, sawed through his flesh with a dull
pocket knife, and freed himself.

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:45.969
Ralston harnessed some of our most powerful
psychological forces -- hunger, thirst, desire

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.129
to be part of a family, need to return to
the human community -- they ignited his tenacity,

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.629
which allowed him to do an incredible thing.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.499
He harnessed the power of motivation.

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.530
Obviously, in a big, big way.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.589
[INTRO]

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.589
In its most basic sense, motivation is the
need or desire to do something. Whether that

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.439
need is biological, social, or emotional,
and whether that something is making dinner,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.609
going to college, or cutting off your arm,
motivation is what gets you moving.

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.799
But the big question is, why? Why do we do
anything? I mean, why ever bother changing

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.240
out of my sweatpants?

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.079
Psychologists often view motivation in one
of four ways. On their own, none of these

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.509
theories is perfect, but taken together, they
help us understand what drives us. Let's start

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.039
with the first theory: an evolutionary perspective.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.749
For a while in the early 20th century, it
was popular to think of all behaviors as instincts,

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:51.950
or innate drives to act a certain way. But
this so-called Instinct Theory was misguided,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.659
in part because the presence of a tendency
doesn't always mean it's supposed to be there.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.880
Like, we can imagine why a bunch of people
might start rioting at a heated soccer match,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.039
but to say that they're supposed to -- a little
short-sighted.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.740
Evolution is a far more complex, chaotic,
and interesting process than that. Plenty

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.410
of behaviors could just be accidents of evolution
-- late paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.190
these accidents "spandrels," or traits that
rather than being "adaptive" just stuck around

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.240
as byproducts of other processes.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.070
Today we define instincts as complex, unlearned
behaviors that have a fixed pattern throughout

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.470
a species. For example, dogs instinctively
shake their fur when wet, salmon return to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.600
the stream in which they hatched, and human
babies know how to suckle just minutes after

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.530
being born.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.670
These are true, genetically-predisposed instincts
that do not require learning.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.000
But today we understand that while certain
tendencies may be genetic, individual experience

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.770
plays a major role in behavior and motivation,
as well.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.520
So another theory of motivation suggests that
a physiological need, or drive, simply compels

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.440
us to reduce that need. This is called the
drive-reduction theory. This can be as simple

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.680
as hearing my stomach growl, and looking for
a burrito. My need is food, my drive is hunger,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.450
my drive-reduction behavior is burrito.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.690
Drive reduction is all about maintaining your
body's homeostasis -- the physiological balance

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.790
of its systems.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.430
As much as we're pushed to reduce our drives,
we're also pulled along by incentives — the

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.540
positive or negative stimuli that either entice
or repel us. The mouth-watering smell of that

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.430
burrito pulls me toward it, just as much as
my hunger pushes me there.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.870
However, we're also clearly more complicated
than our homeostatic systems, and drive-reduction

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.090
theory may over-simplify a lot of our behavior.
For example, a person may fast for days, ignoring

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.730
their body's hunger to honor some spiritual
or political cause; and I know I'm not the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.140
only one who sometimes eats when I'm not actually
hungry.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.830
So a third theory -- the theory of optimal
arousal -- attempts to fill in some of those

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.020
gaps. It suggests rather than just reducing
a drive or tension, like hunger, we're motivated

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.580
to maintain a balance between stimulation
and relaxation.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.330
Say you're holed up in your house all weekend
studying. You're bored and lonely and gettin'

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.000
weird, so you call up some friends to go mountain
biking or to a karaoke bar or whatever you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.410
like to do to for stimulation.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.860
The idea here is that you want to hit the
right level of arousal -- which, take note,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.320
psychologists often use in a non-sexual sense
-- without getting overstimulated and stressed.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.130
So if you nearly break your face on that bike
ride, or if the Journey covers at karaoke

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.400
start getting too intense, you may need to
back off and take a nap.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.280
Of course everyone has a different level of
optimal arousal, and I'm guessing Aron Ralston's

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.480
was fairly high. Adrenaline junkies may jump
out of planes to hit their ideal level, whereas

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.940
others might be satiated by an engaging book,
or new knitting pattern. No matter which,

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.820
the optimal arousal theory suggests that we're
motivated to avoid both boredom and stress.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.550
And obviously not all needs are created equally.
If I'm suffocating and can't catch a breath,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.860
I'm not going to be thinking about eating
that burrito. And if I'm about to be ravaged

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.580
by lions, I'm not going to worrying about
my paycheck.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.380
American psychologist Abraham Maslow illustrated
this shuffling of priorities in the mid-1900's

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.510
with his famous hierarchy of needs.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.000
Down at the bottom of the pyramid you'll find
our most basic physiological needs for food,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.940
water, air, and moderate temperatures.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.690
The next rung up speaks to our need for safety,
then comes love and belonging, followed by

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.290
esteem or respect, and finally, once all those
needs have been met, we have the relative

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.560
luxury of being motivated by self-actualization
and spiritual growth, and yoga retreats and

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.700
stuff.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.170
Of course there are problems with Maslow's
vision. Empirical research hasn't really supported

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.050
his hierarchy. We tend to skip around on that
pyramid all the time, and the importance of

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.460
those higher-level needs may vary depending
on our culture and finances and personalities.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.510
But still, everyone is restricted by the lowest
levels of the pyramid. So, regardless of the

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.620
theories about why we have them, most schools
of psychological thought agree that we are

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.900
driven by at least three big motivators: sex,
hunger, and the need to belong.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.040
We'll do a whole lesson later about all sorts
of sex-related stuff, including how it motivates

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.639
us. There's a lot there. For now, let's just
say that sexual motivation is how we promote

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.320
the survival of our species through recreation
and/or procreation - both of which help human

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.870
communities bond and expand. Without it, none
of us would be here today, thinking about

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.290
burritos and severed arms and sex and stuff.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.660
Internally, we are biologically driven to
knock boots by our sex hormones. We're also

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.690
motivated by psychological and sociocultural
influences - ranging from suggestive external

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.730
stimuli plastered all over billboards, magazines,
and TVs in the form of, you know, scantily-clad

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.960
bodies sprawled out on beaches to more genteel
desires like love, family, or adherence to

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.780
personal, religious, or cultural values.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.889
Sex is a big motivator, but it isn't precisely
a need, no matter what anyone has told you.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.620
People do not die without it.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.340
Hunger, though...

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.730
After air and water, food is our body's greatest
need, and thus obtaining food is one of our

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.450
greatest motivations.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:45.360
Hunger may seem pretty simple. Eat food, stay
alive. But physiologically and psychologically,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.270
there is a lot going on. And like so many
things, it starts in the brain.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.270
The sensation of hunger usually begins with
a drop in your blood-sugar level. Glucose

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.770
is our body's primary source of energy, and
while you might not initially feel it drop,

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:00.090
your brain will.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:05.150
Your hypothalamus monitors your blood chemistry,
and responds to both high levels of the "hunger

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:09.980
hormone" ghrelin, and low levels of glucose
by triggering that feeling of hunger reminding

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.240
you to eat something. I am in fact experiencing
it right now!

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.290
Once you've eaten that burrito, your metabolism
takes over, converting that food into energy.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:21.960
But while our physiological need for calories
varies depending on our body size and composition,

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:27.710
your gender, and your age, our hunger is also
shaped by our psychology, culture, and mood.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:32.199
And these factors don't just rule when we're
hungry, they also guide what we're hungry

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:32.620
for.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.800
Biologically speaking, most humans, and many
other animals, have a genetic taste for sweets

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.900
and fatty foods, because they're typically
high in energy. But other taste preferences

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.330
are conditioned through experience and culture.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.900
I may have an aversion to oysters because
they once made me sick, and love gingerbread

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.699
cookies because my grandma used to make them.
Although popular in Cambodia, I'm not too

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.860
keen on eating fried tarantulas, just as lots
of folks around the world think that the very

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.800
idea of peanut butter is gross.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.620
Still, the feeling of hunger affects us the
same.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.070
During World War Two in the US, some conscientious
objectors volunteered for medical research

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:06.580
as an alternative way to serve their country.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:11.229
Perhaps the most famous of these studies was
physiologist Ancel Keys' Minnesota Hunger

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:15.900
Experiment, which measured the effects of
semistarvation, by partially starving its

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:16.880
volunteers.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.710
While ethically dubious, the experiment was
geared toward understanding the many small

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.590
and large effects of hunger, which was plaguing
Europe at the time.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:31.290
The study started in 1944, by feeding 36 young,
healthy men a normal diet for three months,

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:36.079
then halving their caloric intake for six
months, then slowly rehabilitating them to

00:08:36.079 --> 00:08:38.169
normal weight during the last three months.

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:43.459
They ate mostly wartime-foods like root vegetables,
bread, and pastas, and were required to walk

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:48.949
22 miles, and participate in various work
and educational activities, for 40 hours each

00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:54.119
week. The goal was to see a 25 percent drop
in body weight during the starvation period.

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:59.089
As you can imagine, the changes were dramatic.
The men became gaunt and listless, and showed

00:08:59.089 --> 00:09:01.869
a decrease in strength, heart rate, and body
temperature.

00:09:01.869 --> 00:09:06.240
But the psychological effects were perhaps
even more dramatic. The men became totally

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.490
obsessed with food. They dreamed about it,
talked about it all the time, read cookbooks.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:15.069
They lost interest in sex and jokes and social
activities. They were irritable, anxious,

00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.889
and depressed.

00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:19.860
In the end, they were all rehabilitated, but
the study gave us some understanding of the

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.490
devastating psychological effects of starvation.
It also showed us something of the social

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:29.360
effects, as the men withdrew from one another
and isolated themselves. As one fundamental

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.899
need was frustrated, these men experienced
the decline of another - the need to belong.

00:09:33.899 --> 00:09:37.860
Humans are social animals. Evolutionarily
speaking, it's fair to say that social bonding

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:42.279
has helped us survive. It's a tough world
out there, and we've got a lot better shot

00:09:42.279 --> 00:09:46.420
at thriving if we're sharing resources and
responsibilities, protecting and supporting

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.319
each other in groups.

00:09:47.319 --> 00:09:51.170
That isn't say you need to be joined at the
hip with everyone--our social needs have to

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:55.980
be balanced with our autonomy, or sense of
personal control, so we feel both connected

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:56.869
and independent.

00:09:56.869 --> 00:10:01.420
But sometimes we're denied that sense of belonging.
We've all experienced the pain of being ignored

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:05.100
or rejected at some point in our lives. It's
worse than just about anything.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:09.339
The evidence for this is abundant - one recent
study suggested that teenagers who had a sense

00:10:09.339 --> 00:10:12.889
of belonging to their community had better
health and emotional outcomes than those who

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:14.399
didn't feel like they belonged.

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:18.759
Cultures all over the world actually use ostracism,
or social exclusion, as a type of punishment.

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:23.639
Whether it's kids in time-out, adults in exile,
or prisoners in solitary confinement, separation

00:10:23.639 --> 00:10:25.490
feels like a punch in the gut.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.470
Never underestimate the power behind what
motivates us. The need to survive, the need

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:34.160
to belong... if you can harness that motivation,
you can do just about anything. Just ask Aron

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:34.429
Ralston.

00:10:34.429 --> 00:10:38.920
If you were motivated to learn today, hopefully
you took in four theories of motivation including

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.579
the evolutionary perspective, drive-reduction,
optimal arousal, and Maslow's hierarchy of

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:47.389
needs, and how sex, hunger, and the need to
belong motivate us.
