00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
You’re about to cross a street.
What do you do?

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.060
If there are no cars coming, do you stay at
the crosswalk, waiting for the light to change?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.260
Or do you just go for it?

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.860
Do you look left first before you cross, or
do you look right?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.160
Or maybe you just dart across the street,
shouting, ‘Hey I’m walking here!’

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.780
No matter what you do in this situation, what
you do is going to depend on culture.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.220
Now you may be thinking, how can something
like crossing the street be a cultural phenomenon?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.710
Isn’t culture, like, opera and galas and
fancy art openings with tiny hor d’oeuvres?

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.620
Or maybe you think culture is bigger than
all that, that culture is your heritage, traditions

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.220
that have been passed down for generations, like
Quinceañeras, Bar Mitzvahs, or Sweet Sixteen parties.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.660
The fact is, all of these things – street-crossing,
fine arts, and traditional rites of passage
– they are all part of culture.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:53.680
[Theme Music]

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.500
Culture is the way that non-material objects –
like thoughts, action, language, and values – come
together with material objects to form a way of life.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.720
So you can basically break culture down into
two main components: things and ideas.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.200
When you’re crossing the road, you can see
markers of your culture in the things around you –

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.680
the street signs, the width of the
road, the speed and style of the cars.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400
This is material culture, the culture of things.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.730
Books, buildings, food, clothing, transportation.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:26.200
It can be everything from iconic monuments like the Statue of Liberty to something as simple as a crosswalk sign that counts down how many seconds you have to cross the street.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.060
But a lot of the culture that’s packed into
crossing the street is non-material, too.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.560
We interpret the color red to mean stop –
because our culture has assigned red as a
symbol for stop and green for go.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.400
And if you grew up in a country where cars
drive on the right side of the road, your parents
probably taught you to look left first before crossing.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.880
This is non-material culture, the culture
of ideas.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.580
It’s made up of the intangible creations of human
society – values, symbols, customs, ideals.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.140
Instead of the Statue of Liberty, it’s the
idea of liberty and what it means to be free.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:02.140
For our purposes as sociologists, we’ll mainly be focusing on this second type of culture and its three main elements: symbols, values and beliefs, and norms.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.660
Symbols include anything that carries a
specific meaning that’s recognized by people
who share a culture.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.960
Like a stop sign. Or a gesture.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.520
If I do this [holds up one hand, palm out,
then just 1 finger], you probably know that
I mean: hold on a sec.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.780
Non-verbal gestures like this are a form of
language, which is itself a symbolic system that
people within a culture can use to communicate.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.080
Language is more than just the words you
speak or write – and it’s not just a matter of
English or French or Arabic.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.400
The type of language you use in one cultural
setting may be entirely different than what
you’d use in another.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.940
Take how you talk to people online.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.700
New linguistic styles have sprung up that
convey meaning to other people online, because
internet culture.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.500
See, there’s one right there!

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.120
If you’re internet fluent, me saying ‘because’
and then a noun makes perfect sense, as a way
of glossing over a complicated explanation.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.740
But if you’re not familiar with that particular
language, it just seems like bad grammar.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.940
Whether it’s written, spoken or non-verbal, language
allows us to share the things that make up our culture,
a process known as cultural transmission.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.780
And one view of language is that it not only lets us communicate with each other, but that it also affects how people within a culture see the world around them.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.760
This theory, known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, argues that a person’s thoughts and actions are influenced by the cultural lens created by the language they speak.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.300
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to see an
example of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in action.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.700
What gender is the moon?

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.220
For English speakers, this question might
just conjure images of the man in the moon,
but in many languages, nouns have genders.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.060
And in some languages, the moon is feminine,
like the Spanish ‘la luna’.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.220
But in others, the moon is masculine, like
the German ‘der mond.’

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.660
And this affects how Spanish and German people
perceive the moon!

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.820
In one study, Spanish and German people were asked to rate objects – which were gendered in their language – with reference to certain traits.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.420
Like, is the moon beautiful?
Is the moon rugged? Is the moon forceful?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:47.280
The study found that for those whose language used a masculine article, objects were more strongly associated with stereotypically masculine traits, like forcefulness.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.120
Another study found that when a name was assigned to an object, and the name matched the gender of the word for it, it was easier for people to remember the name.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.640
Like, “Maria Moon” tended to be remembered
more readily by Spanish-speakers than by German
speakers.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.780
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.760
Now, I should mention that the Sapir-Whorf
hypothesis is one that researchers are divided on.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:09.860
Benjamin Lee Whorf – the American linguist who
helped shape this theory – did his original research
on indigenous languages like Hopi and Inuit.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.190
And since then, anthropologists have argued
that some of his findings don’t hold up.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.180
For example, Whorf famously claimed that because
the Hopi language describes time differently,
the Hopi people think of time differently.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.460
But anthropological evidence about the Hopi
people suggests otherwise.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.780
And Whorf’s study led to a strange, and
false, stereotype that Hopi people, quote,
“have no sense of time.”

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.900
Sociology is an evolving field, and academic
disagreements like this are just one reason that
we study language and how it shapes our society.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.850
But if language helps us communicate, shape, and
pass on culture, the next element of culture is what
helps us organize culture into moral categories.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.120
Values are the cultural standards that people use
to decide what’s good or bad, what’s right or wrong.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.460
They serve as the ideals and guidelines that
we live by.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.780
Beliefs, by contrast, are more explicit than
values – beliefs are specific ideas about
what people think is true about the world.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.780
So for example, an American value is democracy,
while a common belief is that a good political system
is one where everyone has the opportunity to vote.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.340
Different cultures have different values,
and these values can help explain why we see
different social structures around the world.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.960
Western countries like the United States
tend to value individualism and stress the
importance of each person’s own needs,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:18.820
whereas Eastern countries like China tend
to value collectivism and stress the importance
of groups over individuals.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.900
These different values are part of why
you’re more likely to see young adults in the US
living separately from their parents

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.800
and more likely to see to multi-generational
households in China.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.020
Cultural values and beliefs can also help form
the guidelines for behavior within that culture.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.080
These guidelines are what we call norms, or
the rules and expectations that guide behavior
within a society.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.100
So giving up your seat for an elderly person?
Great.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.280
Picking your nose in public?
Gross.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.380
These are two ways of talking about norms.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.040
A norm simply relates to what we think is
“normal”, whether something is either
culturally accepted, or not.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.479
And we have three main types of norms!

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.360
The first are what we call folkways.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.420
Folkways are the informal little rules that
kind of go without saying.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:06:01.610
It’s not illegal to violate a folkway, but
if you do, there might be ramifications – or
what we call negative sanctions.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.060
Like, if you walk onto an elevator and stand
facing the back wall instead of the door.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.380
You won’t get in trouble, but other people
are gonna give you some weird looks.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.580
And sometimes, breaking a folkway can be
a good thing, and score you some positive
sanctions from certain parts of society.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.960
Like, your mom might ground you for getting a
lip ring, but your friends might think it’s really cool.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.270
Another type of norm are mores, which are more official than folkways and tend to be codified, or formalized, as the stated rules and laws of a society.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.940
When mores are broken, you almost always
get a negative sanction – and they’re usually
more severe than just strange looks.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.460
Standing backward in the elevator might
make you the office weirdo, but you’ll probably
get fired if you come into work topless,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.420
because there are strict rules about what
kinds of clothing – or lack thereof – are
appropriate for the workplace.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.400
Hawaiian shirts – probably not.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.360
No shirt?
You’re fired.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.200
But mores aren’t universal.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:53.940
You may get fired for showing up without a
shirt at work, but men can lay on the beach shirtless,
or walk down the street with no problem.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.840
For women, these norms are different.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.420
In the United States, cultural norms about
women’s bodies and sexuality mean that it’s
illegal for women to go topless in public.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.100
But then in parts of Europe, social norms
are more lax about nudity, and it’s not uncommon
for women to also be shirtless at the beach.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.460
The last of type of norm is the most serious
of the three: taboo.

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:16.640
Taboos are the norms that are crucial to a
society’s moral center, involving behaviors
that are always negatively sanctioned.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.060
Taboo behaviors are never okay, no matter
the circumstance, and they violate your very
sense of decency.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.740
So, killing a person: taboo or not?

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:27.740
Your first instinct might be to say, yes,
killing is awful.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.160
But, while most cultures agree that life is
sacred, and murder should be illegal, it’s
not always considered wrong.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.740
Most societies say it’s okay to kill in
times of war or in self defense.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.300
So what is a taboo?

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:42.780
Cannibalism, incest, and child molestation are
common examples of behavior we see as taboo.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:50.960
Yes, you can kill someone in self-defense, but if you
pull a Hannibal Lector and eat that person, you’re going
to jail, whether it started as self-defense or not.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:52.400
So don’t do that.
Ever.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.920
Norms like these and many others help societies
function well, but norms can also be a kind of constraint,
a social control that holds people back.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.440
Some norms can be bad, like ones that encourage
unhealthy behavior like smoking or binge drinking.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.940
But not all norms have clearly defined
moral distinctions –

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.180
like the way a culture’s emphasis on
competition pushes people toward success,
but also discourages cooperation.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.220
And that’s the tricky thing about culture.

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:20.740
Most of the time you don’t notice the cultural
forces that are shaping your thoughts and actions,
because they just seem normal.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:23.220
That’s why sociologists study culture!

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:30.200
We can’t notice whether our values and our norms
are good or bad unless we step back and look at them
with the analytical eye of a sociologist.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.340
Today we learned what culture is and the difference
between material and non-material culture.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.620
We learned about three things that make up
culture: symbols, values and beliefs, and norms.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:42.140
We looked at how language influences culture
through the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:47.400
and discussed the three types of norms – folkways,
mores, and taboos – which govern our daily life.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:53.220
