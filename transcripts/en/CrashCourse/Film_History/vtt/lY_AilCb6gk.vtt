00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.120
Hey!

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.120
Hello.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.120
Can anybody hear me?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.120
You can?

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.120
Good!

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.120
That’s because of something called synchronous
sound.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.650
It means that the words I’m saying right
now are being recorded, then matched with

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.650
the video.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.929
So when you watch this, the sound of my voice
is in sync with the image of me talking.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.929
Talking.

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:17.929
Talking.

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.619
We take that for granted today, but for the
first few decades of film history, it wasn’t

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.619
possible.

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.160
Theaters had to supply music, sound effects,
and narration through phonographs or live

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
performances.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.500
And when dialogue was absolutely necessary,
filmmakers had actors mouth the words, and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.919
then insert title cards – or inter-titles
– in the middle of scene so the audience

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.200
could read the dialogue for themselves.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.750
It took years of guess-work, tinkering, and
experimentation to make cinema sound the way

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.750
it does today.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.140
But when sound finally arrived, it changed
the way movies were made and watched, forever.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.140
WHAAAT?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.260
You can hear me say WHAAAT now, thanks to
that.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:58.440
[Intro Music]

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.890
Nothing shook the foundations of the film
industry like the coming of sound.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.790
By the mid-1920s, the major studios were churning
out movie after movie, the star system was

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.250
in full swing, and cinema had become an integral
part of popular culture.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.680
But in order to sync pre-recorded sound to
moving pictures, artists and engineers had

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.220
to overcome a few major hurdles.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.680
The first – and most important – was synchronization.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.581
How do you get the image and sound to match
up?

00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:21.910
At the time, image and sound were recorded
and played back using different devices, so

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.400
there was no easy way to link them.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.840
Second, microphone technology was fairly primitive.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.770
Sound quality wasn’t good, and the mics
themselves were too big to conceal.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.640
Third, the process of recording and playing
back sound typically required electricity.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.800
That meant production companies would need
more equipment, larger crews, and access to

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.800
power.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.670
And finally, there was the problem of amplification.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.820
Speaker technology at the time simply wasn’t
loud enough to fill a big theater.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.860
And the search for solutions to these problems
went as far back as the 1880s.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.820
In 1889, Thomas Edison’s assistant, W.K.L.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.880
Dickson, achieved a kind of rough synchronization
between the phonograph and the kinetoscope.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.960
Eventually he came up with a device called
the kinetophone that used a system of pulleys

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.280
to connect the two devices.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.500
Thing is, it was buggy – everything had
to be just right, or the whole system fell

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
apart.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.320
Luckily, at the same time as Dickson, inventors
across Europe and the United States were working

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.160
towards the goal of synchronous sound films.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.899
In fact, three separate synchronizing devices
were on display at the Paris World Exhibition

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.979
in 1900.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.430
None of them solved the whole problem, though.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.599
The common thread in all these early attempts
was the phonograph.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.890
That’s what they used to play back the pre-recorded
sound to accompany the film.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.830
And the problem was, it was really hard to
keep things in sync, you guys.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.749
If the phonograph needle skipped, or the film
jammed in the projector – which happened

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.069
all the time – it was nearly impossible
to re-sync the two without starting all over

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.069
again.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.950
More importantly, the phonograph relied on
cylinders or discs that could only hold four

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.120
or five minutes worth of sound.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.189
By 1905, virtually all films ran longer than
five minutes.

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.340
Since the phonograph seemed like a dead end,
engineers started to look for ways to record

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.629
sound photographically.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:39.629
WHAAAT?

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.629
That’s right!

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.319
They hoped to translate sound waves into patterns
of light that could be recorded directly onto

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.379
a strip of film.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.859
They called this technology sound-on-film.

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.390
Which is not creative naming, but it works.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.720
The first experiments with sound-on-film began
in 1910 when Eugène Augustin Lauste, who

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.450
worked for Dickson in Edison’s lab, successfully
recorded sound right next to the image track

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.450
on film.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.260
In 1919, a trio of German inventors came up
with something called the Tri-Ergon process.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.231
They used a photoelectric cell to translate
sound waves into electric impulses, which

00:03:07.231 --> 00:03:11.209
were then converted into light waves and recorded
photographically onto the film strip.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.670
Most notably, they innovated a flywheel into
the projector that would keep the film speed

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.670
consistent.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.140
This mechanism was so superior to anything
else at the time – and its patent so airtight

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.340
– that everyone had to pay royalties to
the Tri-Ergon creators to use it.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.299
At roughly the same time, an American inventor
named Lee de Forest developed his own sound-on-film

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.299
system.

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.090
It was very similar to the Tri-Ergon process,
but de Forest’s version solved the problem

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.090
of amplification.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.739
In 1907, while working on radio broadcast
technology, de Forest patented the Audion

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.170
3-Electrode Amplifier Tube.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.170
My nickname in high school.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.549
This was a vacuum tube that amplified sound
and sent it into a speaker, sort of like the

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.050
way a projector’s lens takes an image and
blows it up so you can see it on a large screen.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.840
In 1919 de Forest realized his technology
might help achieve synchronous sound, and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.950
by 1922 he’d developed the process enough
to test it commercially.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.489
He formed the De Forest Phonofilm Company
and set about making some of the very first

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.489
sync-sound films.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:57.790
He called them phonofilms.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.159
Most were just musical performances, vaudeville
acts, and speeches simply meant to showcase

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.200
the technology, but a few were narrative films.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.900
By the mid-1920s, a hundred exhibitors in
the Eastern United States, Britain, and Canada

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.189
had wired their movie theaters for sound,
specifically to screen de Forest’s phonofilms.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.139
But Hollywood wasn’t ready for it yet because,
the American studios were very good at producing

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.139
silent movies.

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.959
And they weren’t convinced that it was worth
the expense to change the way they made and

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.949
showed films just to accommodate sound.

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.050
Studio heads thought that “talking pictures,”
or talkies, were just a novelty that would

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.050
fade away.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.250
That began to change in 1926, when a subsidiary
of AT&amp;T introduced the Vitaphone system.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.169
Instead of sound-on-film, the Vitaphone was
a sound-on-disc process that solved the duration

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.750
problem by recording the sound on multiple
discs.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.750
Genius.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.819
At first, the studios all passed on the Vitaphone.

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.099
They said, “No way.

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:40.099
Punch.”

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.099
Then along came Warner Brothers.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.410
At the time, they were just a small studio
looking to elbow their way into the big leagues.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.199
And they decided to take a chance and be the
first film studio to make and show sync-sound

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:49.449
films on a large scale.

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.419
They leased the rights to the Vitaphone system
– as well as the right to sublease it to

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.580
other studios – and set about converting
their theaters to handle sound films.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.400
Now, originally, they didn’t intend to incorporate
dialogue into the sound.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.580
Their idea was simply to use it for music
and sound effects.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.580
Their first effort was the 1926 film Don Juan,
a sumptuous costume drama starring John Barrymore.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.599
Before the film, they played an hour of sync-sound
short films, including musical performances

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.030
and a brief spoken message from Will Hays,
president of the Motion Pictures Producers

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.340
and Distributors of America, welcoming the
world to the era of sound.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.120
This is part of what he had to say:

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:30.349
“My friends, no story ever written for the
screen is as dramatic as the story of the

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:31.930
screen itself.”

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.270
People were blown away.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.560
They were like, “Whaaat?

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.560
That guy’s talking!”

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.270
Don Juan broke box office records in city
after city.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.540
Film critics lavished praise on the Vitaphone
system.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.030
And a Columbia University physicist said of
the Hays speech: “No closer approach to

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.490
resurrection has ever been made by science.”

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.020
Now, this doesn’t mean that the coming of
sound worked out for everybody.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.569
Until now, screen actors up had been trained
to act through gestures.

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:55.440
Suddenly, dialogue – not to mention your
voice and your enunciation – had real consequences.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.930
And not every silent film star was able to
make the transition.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.510
Buster Keaton, for instance, was known as
the Great Stoneface for the stoic expression

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.260
he wore, no matter how things were falling
apart around his character.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.910
But then sound came along, and the charm of
Keaton’s deadpan silence was lost, when

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.270
he started to speak.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.610
Kinda like when I start to speak.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.539
Sound films also threatened the musicians
that played live music at movie theaters.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:16.550
And, of course, it was still going to cost
a boatload of money to convert production

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:18.610
studios and movie theaters to sound.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.270
Nevertheless, by 1927, the writing was on
the wall.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.030
Sound was coming, and the major studios couldn’t
stall any longer.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.990
That year, the “big three” studios – MGM,
Famous Players, and First National – adopted

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.470
the Vitaphone process and set about converting
their theaters.

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.120
Meanwhile, Warner Brothers had already finished
building a sound studio on their lot, and

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.819
producing their next film, The Jazz Singer.

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.550
The plan was to make a film with music, not
dialogue; but when star Al Jolson improvised

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.560
a few lines, the studio agreed to leave them
in.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.420
Unlike most lines I improvise for this.

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.880
Jolson: Now, Mama. Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.920
Jolson: Mama. Listen, now I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.320
Jolson: You know with the show. I'm gonna sing it Jazzy.

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.580
Jolson: Now, get this.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.800
Jolson: [singing] Blue skies, smilin' at me. Me, me, me!

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.420
Jolson: [singing] Nothin' but, little blue skies, do I see. Doh, doh, doh doh doh!

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.080
And that – this incidental spoken dialogue
– really sent audiences over the top.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.849
Think about it – they’d always heard music
in some form while watching a film, either

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.639
from live musicians or a phonograph.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.860
And they’d been spoken to, in speeches and
performances like the Hays speech or the de

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.860
Forest phonofilms.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.870
But they’d never heard informal dialogue
spoken to other characters within the world

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.870
of the film!

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.580
Suddenly, audiences were listening in on the
story.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.800
And overhearing the dialogue made the story
seem more real.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.840
In some ways, sync-sound completed the “illusion
of reality” that began three decades earlier

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.479
with the very first motion pictures.

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:29.270
Soon, new genres emerged.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.940
Musicals and dance movies were suddenly possible.

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:39.300
Disney led the way in feature film animation,
incorporating dialogue and songs into their

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.560
shorts and features.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:48.380
Gangster movies and monster films became more
popular, as sound effects and music allowed

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.880
them to ratchet up tension.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.540
Also, newspaper movies became fashionable,
as films like The Front Page and Platinum

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:58.600
Blonde had reporters trading witty banter
as they chased down stories.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.749
These films eventually led to classics like
Howard Hawks’ His Girl Friday and even the

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:03.430
great Citizen Kane.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.430
Never heard of it.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:05.470
Old genres got a facelift too.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.749
Comedies in particular found new ways to make
us laugh through dialogue, instead of relying

00:08:08.749 --> 00:08:09.949
on physical humor alone.

00:08:09.949 --> 00:08:13.189
On the technical side, the arrival of sound
changed career opportunities for women in

00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:14.189
film as well.

00:08:14.189 --> 00:08:15.189
And not for the better.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:17.449
Prior to sound, women edited more Hollywood
films than men did.

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:20.289
That’s because, at the time, editing was
thought of as menial labor, the grunt work

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.710
of painstakingly splicing together bits of
film.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.370
Then sound came along, and the technological
requirements of the job multiplied.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.431
And almost overnight, film editors were responsible
for assembling not just images, but the sound

00:08:30.431 --> 00:08:32.289
effects, music, and dialogue as well.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:34.440
Just like that, the reign of women in the
cutting room was over.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.870
They saw themselves replaced by men, who were
seen as more technically minded.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.390
But women editors in Hollywood did make a
comeback – from Thelma Schoonmaker, who

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:44.450
cut every Martin Scorsese film from Raging
Bull to The Wolf of Wall Street, to Lisa Lassek,

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.500
who edited Joss Whedon’s Avengers movies.

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.350
Today we talked about the engineering hurdles
and breakthroughs that led to the arrival

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.139
of reliable synchronous sound to cinema.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:54.830
We learned how the Hollywood studios resisted
the arrival of sound films as long as they

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.529
could, until audience demand forced them to
give in.

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:01.040
And we considered how sound film changed the
studios, the films themselves, and the lives

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.130
of those who made them.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:05.930
Which sets us up perfectly for what came next:
the official Golden Age of Hollywood.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:07.370
I’ll see you then!

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:08.370
In the pictures!

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.870
