00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.340
Hello there! How would you like a ticket to one of
the most influential forms of mass communication
the world has ever known?

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.980
It’s a universal language that lets us tell
stories about our collective hopes and fears,

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.570
to make sense of the world and the people
around us.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.080
I’m talking about film.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.040
You probably figured that out because of the title
of this video, but, yeah, I'm talking about film.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:26.030
This powerful medium sits in a sweet spot
of human culture: at the intersection of art,
industry, technology, and politics.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.380
It’s inescapable, like FBI piracy warnings,
and trailers that give away the entire movie.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.680
I'm looking at you, Batman v Superman.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.580
And also vs Wonder Woman, apparently,
'cause I learned that from the trailer.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.220
But before we get to a mouse named Mickey,
a little Tramp, and whether or not Han shot first,
we’re going back to the beginning...

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.260
In a galaxy far, far–
Well, right here

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.900
We have to go all the way back to the beginning
because the creation of this cornerstone of
modern entertainment was basically an accident.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.239
We owe it all to inventors and artists who
were experimenting with new technologies and

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.440
trying to capture snippets of reality, to
see the world in a whole new way.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400
I'm Craig Benzine, and this is
Crash Course Film History.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.000
Ready? Lights! Camera! Action!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.320
Roll the intro now.
We should roll the intro, I think.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:19.260
[Theme Music]

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.240
The term “film” was first used to describe
a specific technology –

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.380
a thin, flexible material coated in light-sensitive emulsion
that retains an image after it’s exposed to light.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.820
It’s also the end product of that photochemical
process.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.000
A film is a movie.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.940
But it’s also a verb to describe the
process of capturing moving pictures, as in,
“I’m going to film a movie today.”

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.960
Or, “Nick is filming me right this very
second.”

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.920
Or, "I'm gonna film a film on film."

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.420
Over time, the original film technology has
switched to analog and digital substitutes

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.260
– first things like VHS or Beta, and eventually
digital video, like when you record something
on your phone.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.380
Now, at the very beginning of its history,
before all these innovations existed,

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.680
film started out as a collection of still images
viewed one after another in rapid succession,
which creates the illusion of motion.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.120
Like what you're seeing right now!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.260
It was a magic trick!

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.360
And from that trick came an art form that’s
a blend of literature, drama, photography,
and music.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.280
So how does this illusion actually work?

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.760
It all comes down to a couple quirks of human
perception, tricks your eyes play on your brain…
or your brain plays on your eyes… or maybe both.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.280
The 19th century British scholar Peter Mark
Roget was the first to describe one of these
tricks, called Persistence of Vision.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.700
Basically, this is the phenomenon that keeps
you from seeing the black spaces between the
frames of a projected film.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.940
Now, frame can mean a lot of things in film
language, but in this case, it’s what we call one of
the still images that make up a movie.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.180
It turns out that if a frame flashes in front
of your eyes, your brain retains that image for
about a fifth of a second after it’s gone.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.220
If another frame appears within that fifth
of a second, your brain won’t register the
black space between them.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.730
You’ll just perceive the next image.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.160
So when a film flashes 24 frames per second
in front of your eyes, your brain doesn’t interpret it as
24 images separated by flashes of black.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.100
Instead, it looks like a constant picture.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:55.260
This effect can be combined with another oddity of
perception called the Phi Phenomenon, defined in 1912
by the Czech-born psychologist Max Wertheimer.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.500
Incidentally, "oddity of perception" –
my nickname in high school.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.760
The Phi Phenomenon is an optical illusion
that lets you see a series of images in rapid
succession as continuous motion.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.740
Think of those flip books you played with
as a kid:

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.680
Take a series of still pictures, shot or drawn
in sequence, flip them quickly before your
eyes and, voilá! The illusion of motion.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.460
You have yourself a “motion picture,”
or a “moving picture.”

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.520
In other words, a moving-picturey.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.920
Better yet, a “movie.”
Write that down, that's what we're going with.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.040
Now, people have been telling stories since
we’ve had language, and they’ve been using pictures
– even animating them – for almost as long.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.480
One line of thinking traces “movies” all
the way back to cave paintings in places like
Chauvet, France or El Castillo, Spain.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.900
You know – those images of animals, trees,
and human figures, painted on stone walls
as far back as 32,000 years ago.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.480
Scientists think the original artists might
have used flickering torchlight to make them
appear to move.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.220
Fast forward to just 5000 years ago, and we find
people inventing more sophisticated devices to
create that same illusion of motion.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.300
Among these pre-film animation tools,
the ones we’re most familiar with are called
zoetropes.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.360
Think of these as a bowl or a deep cylinder
with sequential images painted on the inside
and small slits or windows cut into the edges.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.010
Spin the bowl and peer through the slits and
– thanks to Persistence of Vision and the Phi
Phenomenon – the pictures seem to move.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.340
Oooh!

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.180
Over the centuries, these devices came in
lots of different forms and just as many names:
phenakistoscopes, stroboscopes, stereoscopes...

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.580
All kinds of ‘scopes. But not Scope,
the mouthwash – that's something else.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.580
And for a long, long time, this is as close
as we ever got to film.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.419
Until photography came along.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.370
Now, it’s important to remember that no one
set out to invent movies.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.580
There was no one mastermind, and no
grand plan to revolutionize communication
or art on a global scale.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.940
If I was around, it would've been me,
but there wasn't anyone.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.980
Instead, film as we know it today exists
because of a series of happy accidents, technical
innovations, and scientific byproducts.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.420
‘Cause really, at the beginning, nobody
knew what they were doing.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.640
Just like now!

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.480
I'm lookin' at you, Batman v Superman.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.680
Photography came about in the early-to-mid-19th
century, at a time of great scientific and artistic innovation.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.400
People of means all over the world were tinkering
in their spare time, playing around with technology

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.460
and seeing what they could create, combine,
augment, or transform.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.340
Before the photograph was invented, people
were isolating images of the world around
them with devices like the camera obscura.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.880
From the Latin meaning “dark chamber,”
a camera obscura is essentially a box, tent,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.120
or room with a lens or pinhole in one end,
and a reflective surface like a mirror at the other.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.140
Light travels through the hole and displays
an inverted image on the mirror.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:15.640
Like most of these pre-photography technologies, the camera obscura was mostly a novelty, a toy, or sometimes a tool that let artists create images to study or trace.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.320
As the 19th century dawned, folks started
playing around with photosensitive chemicals,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.560
to figure out their properties while trying
not to melt themselves with acid.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.000
Which we should all try to do, in practice.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.300
In the 1820s, a French inventor named Joseph
Nicéphore Niépce took the first known camera
photograph.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.140
He called it “View from the Window at Le
Gras.”

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.020
Niépce used a camera obscura to project an image
onto a pewter plate coated in a light-sensitive chemical.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.240
The areas of the chemical that were hit
with the brightest light hardened, but the areas
touched by weaker light could be washed away,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.940
so a crude permanent record of the original image survived.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.580
Scientists now believe it took a couple days
of exposing the plate to light for the image
to finally show up.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.660
So we’re still a long way from movies!

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.860
But we’re getting closer.
Get excited.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.080
Louis Daguerre – another Frenchman, and
a close buddy of Niépce – was able to shorten
the exposure time to just a couple of minutes.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.440
His daguerreotype process became the first
commercially-available, mass-market means
of taking photographs in 1839.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.300
And this is usually considered to be
photography’s birthday.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:07.960
Hooray!
Happy birthday–

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.520
But hold on, the daguerreotype still had a
few problems to work out:

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.360
the photographs were pretty fragile, they weren’t easy
to replicate, and the chemicals were, shall we say, toxic.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:24.020
Along came George Eastman, an American entrepreneur and the founder of Eastman Kodak, who invented a way of taking pictures on paper, rather than metal or glass plates.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.840
This method also didn’t need as many chemicals,
which probably saved a lot of snap-happy inventors
from health problems.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.280
Now photography was off to the races.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.280
Literally.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.100
So let’s go to the Thought Bubble and see
how photographs were used to pause time and
take a closer look at movement.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.920
Take it away, Thought Bubble! Well, I–
I will take it– I'm gonna narrate, so...

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.430
In 1872, Leland Stanford, the former governor
of California and a horse race aficionado,

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:52.220
made a bet with another bigwig that a horse
at full gallop raises all four hooves off the ground
at some point.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.210
To settle the bet, Stanford commissioned a
photographer and inventor named Eadweard Muybridge
to find photographic proof.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.220
So, Muybridge set up twelve cameras along
a racetrack, each triggered by a tripwire to capture
a still image of a horse in motion.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.380
His set of twelve photos was something brand
new: rapid motion broken down into frozen,
studiable moments.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.640
Spoiler alert – Governor Stanford
won his bet!

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.860
There were a couple images where that horse
wasn’t touching the ground at all.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.640
Muybridge’s experiment launched a wave
of “motion studies,”

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.980
as photographers and inventors all over the world
began using these new technologies to break down
continuous motion into individual images.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.280
And that was one giant step closer to motion
pictures.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.300
Thanks Thought Bubble!
You're so great!

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.120
One of those photographers was yet another
Frenchman – a man named Étienne-Jules Marey,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.220
whose training in physiology led him to
capture motion studies of birds in flight
and human athletes in action.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.040
Instead of tripwires like Muybridge, Marey invented
what he called a chronophotographic gun (awesome)

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.600
and switched from sheets of photographic paper
to rolls, allowing him to take bursts of photographs
– 12 per second.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.480
Even with all these increasingly-fancy techniques,
it’s important to note that these were still just
series of photographs.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.300
Motion studies were sometimes projected,
using devices like Muybridge’s zoopraxiscope,
but nobody was trying to make movies yet.

00:07:58.300 --> 00:07:59.620
So, the world was boring.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:09.690
Each of these innovations set up Thomas Edison and a scientist who worked for him named W.K.L. Dickson to invent the kinetograph – the world’s first motion picture film camera.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:15.580
And they, in turn, paved the way for the first
filmmakers to experiment with motion picture
technologies and storytelling.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:21.060
We mentioned earlier that film is an illusion,
but it’s an illusion that’s carefully crafted by people
who want to show a specific point of view.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.200
With aesthetic choices – from shot angle
and shot size to lens type and lighting style

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.020
and how much hair you put on a wookie –
filmmakers can further affect how we, as an
audience, interpret reality.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.860
In a real sense, film wasn’t invented,
it was stumbled upon.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:39.100
A series of happy accidents eventually led
us to Citizen Kane, Grand Illusion, Black Girl,
and the experimental works of Stan Brackage.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:44.160
Not to mention, things like The Wizard of Oz,
Raiders of the Lost Ark, Captain America: Civil War,
and Sharknado!

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.640
There’s a whole world of film out there
to discover, and there’s a lot that film can
help you discover about yourself too.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.120
And that’s the story we’ll continue, next
time we meet.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.280
Today we talked about how film is a sort of
magic trick, thanks to the ways our eyes and
brains work.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.660
Thank you eyes and brains!

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:01.520
We introduced the very, very beginnings of
film, when people started using sequential
images to tell stories.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:05.630
We discussed photography as a huge technological
leap forward, since chemicals and light could

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.850
capture images and break down fast-moving
reality like never before.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:13.920
And next time, we’ll learn about the very
first motion picture cameras, and the start
of movies as we know them now.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.820
