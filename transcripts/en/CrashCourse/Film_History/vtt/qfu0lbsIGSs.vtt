00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.379
Films can be a lot of things: A form of mass
communication; a means of personal expression;

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.889
or a business, big or small… depending on
how many superheroes you cram into one movie.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.349
But films can also create, clarify, or reinforce
a national identity.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.250
In many places outside of the United States
and Europe, cinema arrived relatively late,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.430
and often at a time of political upheaval.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.080
Filmmakers used their movies to tell their
own stories and establish new, collective identities.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.240
Although the industries of Africa, South America,
and the Middle East relatively small,

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.880
these films and filmmakers are
vitally important both to local audiences

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.880
and to the diversity of world cinema.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:45.760
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.840
African cinema is generally divided between

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.780
North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.899
The biggest film producer in North Africa
is Egypt, and Egyptian cinema has dominated

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.260
the Arab world for decades.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.900
Egyptian cinema’s “golden age” ran from
the 1940s to the 1960s.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.670
In this era, the studios produced Hollywood-style
genre movies and prestige dramas.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.780
In 1952, the Egyptian monarchy was overthrown,
and a new military regime was ushered in by

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.430
a charismatic leader, Gamal Abdel
Nasser.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.140
Nasser’s government nationalized the film
industry in 1966 and began exercising significant

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.030
control over what movies got made.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.100
Many filmmakers felt stifled, unable to produce
films even vaguely critical of the current regime.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.080
But Egyptian filmmakers still found ways to
produce classics at the time, from Al Haram

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.450
by Henry Barakat to Shadi Abdel Salam’s
The Night of Counting the Years.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.490
In the 1970s, Egyptian cinema began to find
a balance between politics and entertainment.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.720
And during this time, their first internationally-recognized
director emerged.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.330
Youssef Chahine was born
in 1926.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.840
After college, he convinced his parents to
send him to Hollywood to study acting.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.780
He then returned to Egypt and directed his
first feature film at just 23, a movie called

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.420
Daddy Amin... who said actors can't direct?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.060
His second film, Nile Boy, was invited to
the prestigious Cannes Film Festival.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.979
And his third, The Blazing Sun, introduced
the world to Omar Sharif, an actor who would

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.690
go on to international stardom in English
language films like Lawrence of Arabia and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.690
Doctor Zhivago.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.740
But Chahine’s major achievement was an autobiographical trilogy, made between 1978 and 1990,

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.729
which traced the social history of modern Egypt.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.980
In the 1980s, as government censors relaxed
a bit, several women directors graduated from

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.000
the Egyptian Film Institute and began making
movies with explicitly feminist themes.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.050
This marked a new and vital phase of Egyptian
production, as Asmaa El-Bakry directed

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.240
1991’s Beggars and Proud Ones
and Inas Al-Degheidy

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.840
released Lady Killers the following year.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.030
The Gulf War in 1991 and the emergence of
satellite television brought the Egyptian

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.700
film industry to a near-standstill.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.060
But by the mid-2000s, domestic production
had rebounded and continues to thrive to this day.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.200
Algeria is home to another significant North
African film industry.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.340
After a vicious war and winning their independence
from France in 1962, Algerian movies were

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.710
mostly what they called “freedom-fighter
cinema.”

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.340
These were films about the struggle to escape
colonial rule.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.160
It wasn’t until the 1970s, however, that
an Algerian film broke out onto the world stage.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.320
Mohammed Lakdar-Hamima’s Chronicle of the
Years of Fire depicted one family’s epic

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.120
journey through the end of the colonial period.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.560
The film won the Grand Prix at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1975.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.420
Beginning in 1992, a militant Islamic insurgency
took root in Algeria, and the ensuing violence

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.319
has forced most Algerian filmmakers to live
and work abroad.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.740
Many contemporary films focus on characters
that have left Algeria and struggle with their

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.240
identities as expatriates.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.740
Rachid Bouchareb’s 2010 film Outside the Law, for instance, deals

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.900
with three Algerian brothers living in France
between 1945 and 1962, during the Algerian

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.900
war for independence.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.740
Now, one notable film-producing country in
sub-Saharan Africa is Senegal, another former

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.740
French colony.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.740
And the undisputed father of Senegalese film
is Ousmane Sembène.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.760
A veteran of World War II, Sembène moved

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.150
to France in 1947 and experienced racism while
working in a car factory and at the shipping

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.650
port of Marseille. He turned these experiences into his first

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.420
French-language novel, The Black Docker, in
1956.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.560
And he would return time and again to themes
of isolation, persecution, and loss of identity

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.560
in his films.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.290
After studying filmmaking in the Soviet Union,
Sembène returned to Senegal to make a twenty-minute

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.680
short called Borom Sarret in 1963, commonly
considered the first indigenous black African film.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.680
Sembène’s next film, Black Girl, stands
as one of the first anti-colonial films to

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.260
come out of Africa and gain international
recognition.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.840
The story follows a young Senegalese woman
working as a nanny for a French family in

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.420
the capital city of Dakar.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.670
After accepting an offer to return to France
with them, she finds herself disrespected

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.540
and abused, surrounded by a culture that refuses
to accept her.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.519
And at the end of the film, her story ends
in tragedy.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.430
Sembène would go on to make films right up
to his death in 2007, wrestling with complex

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.770
issues of identity and culture in colonial
and post-colonial Africa.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.250
Other African countries have their own vibrant
filmmaking traditions.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:31.220
Angola established a film school in 1977,
two years after it won independence from Portugal.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.320
The country of Burkina Faso is home to the
Pan-African Festival of Cinema and Television,

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.470
the largest African film event in the world.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.240
And Nigeria has a vital film culture with
its own star system, making it the third most

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.800
valuable film industry in the world.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.650
Now, another region that boasts a long history
of post-colonial and indigenous cinema is

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.650
Latin America.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.740
Although many Latin American film industries
have been dominated by films from the United

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.400
States, Cuba and Brazil have maintained some
autonomy.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.650
Cuba produced about 150 feature films prior
to the Cuban Revolution in 1959.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.220
But almost immediately after Fidel Castro
took over, the film industry became an arm

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.220
of his government.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.889
He founded a national film institute and commissioned
films through the National Board of Culture.

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.840
Like many leaders before him, Castro understood
the power cinema had to influence masses of

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.940
people, many of whom were poor and illiterate.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.960
Most established filmmakers fled or were pushed
out, so the revolutionary era of Cuban cinema

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.710
began with a handful of people with little
filmmaking experience and some old equipment.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.060
Over the next two decades, they would produce
over 100 feature films, 900 documentary shorts,

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.020
and 1,300 weekly newsreels. That's a lot of content!

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.270
By the 1970s, Cuban cinema’s infrastructure
of domestic production and distribution were

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.680
in place, and the films got more sophisticated.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.370
Genres and styles multiplied, encompassing everything from Sergio Giral’s experimental Marxist work The Other
Francisco,

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.900
to Sara Gómez’s One Way or Another, a fusion of Hollywood style and avant-garde social critique.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.020
But the 1990s hit Cuban cinema hard.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.890
With the fall of communism in Europe, Castro’s
government had few allies besides China and

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:50.890
North Korea.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.460
Movie production fell off a cliff, dropping
from about 10 feature films per year to just

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.460
two or three.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.000
And political repression got worse, so many
filmmakers left the country to live in exile

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.180
throughout Latin America.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.001
Eventually, a combination of factors led to
a resurgence of film production in Cuba: like

00:06:04.001 --> 00:06:07.790
digital technology making production less
expensive, coupled with relaxing tensions

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:08.790
with the United States.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.110
Now, the other major Latin American film industry
hails from Brazil.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.940
In 1924, the majority of films screened in
Brazil came from Hollywood, like the rest

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:16.940
of Latin America.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.550
President Getùlio Vargas tried to end the
dominance of Hollywood cinema by establishing

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.840
quotas for local film production in 1932,
which continued into the 1950s.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.840
But that didn’t do much.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.960
The highly charged political atmosphere of
the 1960s was the real catalyst for change.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.590
Inspired by the aesthetic of the Italian Neo-Realists
and the low-budget filmmaking techniques of

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.240
the French New Wave, a group of Brazilian
filmmakers created cinema novo or new cinema.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.900
The cinema novo directors made films that
deliberately subverted the norms of classical

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:45.560
narrative cinema, in direct response to what
they saw as the colonization of Brazilian

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.690
cinema by Hollywood.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.090
The group’s unofficial leader, Glauber Rocha,
made Black God, White Devil in 1964.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.840
It’s about a poor ranch hand who’s cheated
out of his wages, kills his boss, and goes

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.630
on the run with his wife and a violent, apocalyptic
preacher.

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.990
There’s a fearlessness to the film, and
a rejection of a traditional moral code.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.810
Nelson Pereira dos Santos made Barren Lives in 1963, another

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.770
key film in the early cinema novo movement,
and one invited to the Cannes Film Festival.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.400
His film tells the story of an impoverished
family trying to survive in Brazil’s drought-ridden

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.509
northeastern plain.

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.229
This focus on low-budget productions that
examine the socio-political landscape caught

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.320
on in other Latin American countries.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.820
Indigenous filmmakers found inspiration to
tell their stories without relying on traditional

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.180
film studios or government assistance.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.430
And while their films might not screen much
internationally, filmmakers from Argentina

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.070
and Chile to Colombia and Peru have used this
model to forge their own cinematic identities.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.670
Now, one of the major players in Middle
Eastern cinema is Iran, whose domestic market

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.180
was also dominated by U.S. movies for years,
until the Iranian Revolution in 1979.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.540
The first Iranian-produced film to break out
internationally was Dariush Mehrjui’s

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:50.419
1969 film The Cow, telling the story
of a rural villager whose prized cow dies.

00:07:50.419 --> 00:07:53.400
Mehrjui’s film was banned by the pre-revolutionary
Iranian government.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.820
They wanted films that would project a modern
image to the rest of the world, not ones that

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.830
examined the day-to-day life of the downtrodden.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.980
Nevertheless, The Cow went on to win top prizes
at the Chicago and Venice Film Festivals and

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.960
set the template for the Iranian New Wave.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.639
Much like the French New Wave and Brazil’s
cinema novo, the Iranian New Wave produced

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.980
films that explored the lives of ordinary
people, especially those facing hardship and persecution.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.960
After the Revolution, the government of Ayatollah Khomeini

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:20.139
exercised strict theocratic censorship over
Iranian film, decimating production and prompting

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:22.330
many established filmmakers to flee the country.

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.370
The Iranian film industry finally began to
recover in the 1990s, as filmmakers fell into

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.210
two main camps: the “populist cinema”
that made commercial entertainment; and the

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.190
“art cinema” that produced more personal,
esoteric films.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.469
One of the major figures of recent Iranian
cinema is Abbas Kiarostami, whose film A Taste

00:08:37.469 --> 00:08:40.560
of Cherry won the top prize at the Cannes
Film Festival in 1997.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.829
Mohsen Makhmalbaf’s 2001
film Kandahar made a Time magazine list of

00:08:44.829 --> 00:08:46.649
the top 100 movies of all time.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:49.829
And Asghar Farhadi has
won two Best Foreign Language Oscars for his

00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:54.689
elliptical domestic mysteries: A Separation
from 2011, and The Salesman from 2016.

00:08:54.689 --> 00:08:58.730
So although post-Revolution Iranian cinema
took a while to achieve serious global recognition,

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:03.500
it has since emerged as a narrative and stylistic
innovator on the world cinema stage, influencing

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.290
filmmakers and inspiring filmgoers around
the globe.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.139
Today we explored more world cinema, beginning
with the post-colonial cinema of Africa.

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:14.179
We talked about the development of Latin American
cinema through the lens of Cuba and Brazil.

00:09:14.179 --> 00:09:18.850
And we touched on the vital filmmaking tradition
of Iran established during the last 25 years.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.990
Next time, we’ll jump into the strange and
exciting world of experimental and documentary filmmaking.

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.570
It's gonna get weird... and real!

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.879
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.
