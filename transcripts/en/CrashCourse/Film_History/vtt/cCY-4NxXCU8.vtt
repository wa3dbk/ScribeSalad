Hello, my name is Craig and this is Crash Course Film History.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.680
Most movies that we watch are examples of
narrative filmmaking.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.200
They’re works of fiction, and tell made-up
stories about invented characters.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.779
Even films that are based on actual events
are carefully crafted stories that are made

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.410
to seem real or plausible.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.670
But there are types of cinema that play by
entirely different rules... weird rules.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.250
Experimental films reject the techniques and
goals of narrative filmmaking altogether,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.910
aiming to evoke a specific mood, thought,
or emotion.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.371
And documentary films may borrow from the
narrative techniques of fiction films, but

00:00:33.371 --> 00:00:36.700
instead of inventing their stories and characters,
they seek them out in the real world.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.109
These filmmaking styles both have their own
histories, methods, and major figures.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:43.680
And they interact with the fictional narrative
movies we’re used to watching in interesting ways.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.000
It’s time to jump into Experimental and Documentary films.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:59.760
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.469
We could easily spend an entire Crash Course

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.150
series on the history of either experimental
or documentary film.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.990
There’s a long tradition of filmmakers using
cinema to achieve different goals than mainstream

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.180
narrative films, which are usually trying
to educate or entertain by telling a story.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.720
Experimental film covers all kinds of movies,
from shorts and features, to films with vague

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.120
storylines and those that reject narrative
altogether.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.480
No story, no setting, and no characters.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.360
You’ll sometimes see experimental film referred
to as “avant-garde” or “vangarde” cinema.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.160
Or, "That Weird Stuff."

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.250
Whatever you call it, it wasn’t until the
strict conventions of narrative fiction filmmaking

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.160
took hold in the early 20th century that experimental
cinema came into its own.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.810
Because it deliberately opposes those conventions.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.890
Audiences used to mainstream action movies
and rom-coms might feel confused or even frustrated

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.750
by non-narrative experimental cinema.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.910
Some experimental films are trying to make
you feel uncomfortable, test your patience,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.690
or push you to think more deeply.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.720
Others might be profoundly beautiful abstractions,
intended to soothe you.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.720
I like to think that I'm a profoundly beautiful abstraction intended to soothe you.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.440
The thing that binds all these films together

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.560
is that they refuse to be bound by the typical
rules of telling a story.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.940
The first major avant-garde movements in the
arts began to flourish in Europe in the 1920s,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.280
just as narrative feature films were asserting
themselves

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.040
as the dominant commercial form of cinema.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.750
At this time, a group of French filmmakers
inaugurated the Cinèma pur movement.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.960
Their goal was to return film to its most
basic elements, which they saw as light and motion.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.950
Filmmakers like René Clair, Fernand Léger, Man Ray, and Marcel Duchamp emerged

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.300
from the Dada art movement.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.530
They viewed the rules of narrative storytelling
as tyrannical and bourgeois.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.939
So instead of building their films around
characters involved in a plot, they focused

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.139
on images, trick shots, slow or fast motion,
and eventually music and sound.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.390
René Clair’s 1924 film Entr'acte is 22
minutes long and comprised of disconnected

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.319
shots like people running in slow motion,
a cannon being fired, a ballet dancer shot

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.260
from below, and people disappearing.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.120
The rhythm is beautiful, but there’s no
story in sight.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.400
I think I had a dream like that once.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.720
That same year, Fernand Lèger made the frenetic
short film Ballet Mécanique with co-director

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.739
Dudley Murphy.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.859
Constructed of abstract images, either painted
or drawn, upside down shots, mechanical devices,

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:59.160
double-exposures, and more, the film explores
the relationship between art, design, and engineering.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.920
Surrealism, another abstract art movement,
took a more whimsical and sometimes confrontational approach.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.120
The Surrealists drew on dream-like imagery
that invites interpretation, but isn’t directly symbolic.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.920
Their work aims to not have any literal meaning,
but still be moving, scary, beautiful, or absurd.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.840
I like to think of myself as moving, scary, beautiful, or absurd.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.069
Salvador Dali is probably the most famous
surrealist, and collaborated on a funny, disturbing

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.099
film with director Louis Buñuel.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.469
Released in 1929, Un Chien Andalou is made
up of a series of scenes that seem to be about

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.550
a volatile relationship between a man and
a woman.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.560
The film doesn’t make logical sense, and
yet it provokes a strong sense of wonder and dread.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.440
Once you see it, you’ll never forget it.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.840
I saw it, I remember.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.239
Now, the 1940s saw the arrival of American
filmmaker Maya Deren who believed that film

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.980
was meant to create an experience, not tell
a story.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.290
Her films Meshes of the Afternoon and Meditation
on Violence lull viewers into expecting a

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.319
story with some narrative film techniques,
only to move into abstract shots and cuts

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.980
that make it impossible to understand what
the heck is going on.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.010
That’s because the point isn’t to understand the film, but rather to feel it.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.819
And it just goes to show: without a steady
diet of mainstream narrative films, much of

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.200
the avant-garde wouldn’t work – we wouldn’t
have the expectations that Deren’s films subvert.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.600
Hey Nick, can we do an experimental film where I repeatedly punch the eagle over and over again?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.480
Nick: No.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.430
Working from the 1950s to the 1980s, Stan
Brakhage is an acknowledged master of experimental

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.810
film and known for a kind of cinematic collage.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.090
He found unusual techniques to create abstract
imagery, from physically painting or scratching

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.160
the film, to using multiple exposures and
rapid movement to mimic the

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.840
movement of the human eye.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.520
And Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin is perhaps the most widely known living experimental filmmaker.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.360
Working in short films, features, and installation
art, Maddin refuses to be identified with

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.900
any particular style or theme.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.720
In his hands, true experimental film continues
to thrive.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.730
Many narrative filmmakers have drawn inspiration
from experimental film.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.450
Before he made Luke, Han, and Vader, George
Lucas made his own politically charged avant-garde

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.250
shorts as a film student at USC.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.460
David Lynch, the mind behind Blue Velvet and
Twin Peaks, borrows heavily from the experimental

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.460
film tradition.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.820
Although his films are clearly telling stories,
they don’t seem interested in answering

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820
their own questions.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.880
They’re often about ambiguity, dream logic,
and the fine line between absurdity and violence.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.430
Other narrative feature films skirt the edge
of experimental cinema – from E. Elias Merhige’s

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.500
horror movie Begotten and David Gordon Green’s
coming-of-age drama George Washington, to

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.540
Steven Soderbergh’s The Girlfriend Experience.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.540
Just to name a few.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.120
Now, you may not have seen many experimental
films, but chances are you’ve seen a few documentaries.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.840
Documentary film is almost as broad a category
as experimental film.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.250
Some documentaries rely on interviews, while
others use footage of actual events.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.870
Some take a more abstract approach, and others
use narrative fiction techniques to recreate

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:26.870
past events.

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.000
Whatever its methods, a documentary is a work of non-fiction that aims to explore – or document –

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.760
some aspect of reality as accurately
as possible.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.640
But it’s important to remember it’s still
a film told through the lens of a filmmaker,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.300
and still an illusion of reality.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.800
The very first films ever made were documentaries,
from Thomas Edison’s vaudeville acts to

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.550
the Lumière brothers’ slice-of-life shorts
and actualités.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.150
And the first feature-length film known to
incorporate documentary techniques is Robert

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.620
Flaherty’s 1922 film Nanook of the North.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.750
An exploration of the Arctic life of an Inuk
and his family, the film mixed fictional drama

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.560
with documentary footage long before that
was a popular – or even accepted – thing to do.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.990
In fact, we didn’t even have the word “documentary”
until 1929, when Scottish filmmaker John Grierson

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.710
coined it to describe a work of non-fiction
filmmaking.

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.860
In 1932, Grierson wrote an essay called “First
Principles of Documentary” which argued

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.880
that the true power of cinema was in recording
and presenting real life,

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.640
rather than creating fictional stories.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.710
And in the 1930s and ‘40s, documentary film
became a major force in news and propaganda.

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.720
Prior to television, newsreels often screened
before feature films, presenting documentary

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.250
footage of events from around the world.

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.460
Governments harnessed the power of documentary
film to sway public opinion.

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.810
One of the most famous examples is Leni Riefenstahl’s
1935 film Triumph of the Will.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.030
Commissioned by Adolf Hitler, the film documented
the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremburg, Germany

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.580
in 1934, using actual footage, staged scenes,
and stirring music to convey a sense of power

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.750
and myth to the Third Reich.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.500
The United States set about producing their
own documentaries in response,

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.660
like Frank Capra’s “Why We Fight” series, whichdrummed up support for the American war effort

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:49.660
in World War II.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.330
In the post-war period from the 1950s to the
1970s, Cinema Verité came into fashion.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.880
Rather than staging action like a narrative
film or employing a narrator to explain what

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.580
the audience was seeing, Cinema Verité put
you directly in the center of the action as

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.580
it unfolded.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.460
Direct Cinema also emerged in these years.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.240
Very similar to Cinema Verité, these deeply
personal films attempt to present reality

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.110
with as little commentary as possible, and
to consider the complex relationship between

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:13.380
cinema and truth.

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:17.070
Ross McElwee’s 1985 film Sherman’s March
is a great example.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.120
What begins as a journey along the route of
General Sherman’s Army at the end of the

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.700
Civil War, becomes an examination of McElwee’s
inability to find a new romantic partner after

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:25.700
a bad break-up.

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.660
The availability of lighter, cheaper, easy-to-use
film equipment made these kinds of films possible,

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.250
just as they had for Italian Neo-Realism,
French New Wave, and the subsequent generations

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.720
of independent fiction filmmakers.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.930
In the 1980s and ‘90s, documentaries flourished
on television, from nature documentaries on

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.370
the Discovery Channel to long form documentaries
like Ken Burns’ brilliant and comprehensive

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.610
9-part film Civil War.

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.090
These days, platforms like YouTube and Vimeo,
along with high-quality digital cameras and

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.120
editing software, make it possible to produce
and distribute documentaries extremely quickly.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.030
Now, like experimental film, the documentary
tradition has influenced fiction films and

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:57.340
been influenced in return.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:01.000
Mockumentaries use the visual and narrative
techniques of a documentary to tell a fictional story.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.720
Usually to hilarious results... or horrifying.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.360
Rob Reiner’s 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap
pokes fun at the self-serious rock documentaries

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.370
of its time.

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:13.660
One of its stars, Christopher Guest, has made
a career out of mockumentaries, from Waiting

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.330
for Guffman to Best in Show.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.639
In 1999, directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sánchez used the mockumentary form to scare

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.280
the pants off a generation of filmgoers with
The Blair Witch Project.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.280
Wait that wasn't real? Nick?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.280
Nick: No.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.480
It was real.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.579
And Lake Mungo, a 2008 psychological
thriller from Australia, uses documentary

00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:36.450
techniques like interviews to excavate the
story of a family coming to terms with their

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:37.630
daughter’s drowning.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.650
Documentaries have long borrowed fiction film
techniques as well, to recreate scenes and

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.270
weave them in with interviews and strict documentary
footage.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.440
Master documentarian Errol Morris made The
Thin Blue Line in 1988 about a man on death

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.340
row for a crime he didn’t commit.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.320
His cinematic recreations of the crime launched
a wave of true-crime docu-series on television.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.920
These days there’s no shortage of cinematic
documentaries – like the incredible visuals

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:01.640
of Werner Herzog’s Into the Inferno, the
immersive 2015 film The Birth of Saké, and

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:06.450
the heartbreaking narrative of Fire at Sea,
which examines the 2016 European refugee crisis.

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:12.040
And in 2017, the sequel to the BBC’s astounding
Planet Earth series captivated audiences all over again.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.880
Whether we see them on the big screen or a
small one, even today documentaries maintain

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:19.210
the power to inform, entertain, and move us
in profound ways.

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.450
Today we talked about the emergence of experimental
film as an alternative to mainstream narrative

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.450
fiction filmmaking.
