00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.810
Hollywood, here we come!

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.810
The glamor!

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.810
The celebrities!

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.810
The scandals!

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.780
I’m not talking about Bennifer or Brangelina.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.100
Craig: Are they still things?
Nick: No...
Craig: I'm kind of out of touch.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.740
But I'm not out of touch with the Golden Age of Silent
Cinema, when stars rose and fell, studios

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.100
perfected the mass production of films, and
American movies dominated the global film market.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.900
In some ways, it was very different from the
Hollywood we know today.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.500
Movie studios wielded enormous power.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.539
They kept stars and directors under tight
control.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.880
The movies they made were silent.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.980
And a ticket would set you back a whopping
10 or 25 cents.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.820
On the other hand, a lot of the patterns set
during this time still seem awfully familiar today.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.720
Studios marketed films on the power of their
stars.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.829
Genres like gangster movies and romantic comedies
took hold and flourished.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.679
And audiences craved gossip about the private
lives of celebrities.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.789
To understand the world as it is, sometimes
you have to go back to where it all began.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.080
And for Hollywood, that’s the Silent Era.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:01:03.080
[Opening Music Plays]

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.740
Film was going in a lot of different directions

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.000
after the First World War.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.340
In Germany, filmmakers drew on the Expressionist
movement to manipulate their film’s mise-en-scene,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.870
creating groundbreaking horror films.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.390
In Russia, Soviet filmmakers were using cinema
to perfect the arts of propaganda through

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.799
revolutionary editing techniques.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.009
And in the US, the Hollywood studio system
was positioning itself to dominate the rest

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.009
of the world.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.759
Within film studios, the entire filmmaking
process took place – from conceiving, writing,

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.820
and shooting the films, to marketing and distribution.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.590
The studios had chosen California for its
film-friendly sunny weather, its proximity

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.270
to all kinds of terrain, and ... its distance
from Thomas Edison, who spent much of the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.890
1910s fighting for control of the American
film industry from his base in New Jersey.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.659
In the early days of the Silent Era, three
film studios ruled them all: the Famous Players-Lasky

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.969
Corporation, which would eventually become
Paramount Pictures – Loew’s Inc., which

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.649
began as a theater chain – and First National
Pictures.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.469
Not only did these three dominate the marketplace,
they exercised near complete control over

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.799
the creative and personal lives of their stars,
writers, and directors.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.460
Filmmakers often had to choose between following
the studio’s orders or abandoning their careers.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.179
Then, four of the most powerful figures in
early silent cinema came together to create

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:05.609
their own film studio.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.100
In 1919, two directors – Charlie Chaplin
and D.W. Griffith -

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.840
and two stars -- Douglas Fairbanks
and Mary Pickford – founded United Artists.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.010
Their goal was to give filmmakers more control
over their films and a greater percentage

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.080
of the profits.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.340
CHA-CHING! Is what I assume they would say.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.670
Of course, not many filmmakers could afford
to go out on their own like that, so the contract

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.640
system would continue for several more decades.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.890
In 1924, the most powerful studio emerged
when Loew’s purchased Goldwyn Pictures and

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.100
Louis B. Mayer Productions to create Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, better known as MGM.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.100
Which lead to MGM studios which lead to Tower of Terror,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.980
and have you been on Tower of Terror? That's a pretty fun time.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.860
This is a process that would get repeated
throughout the 1920s and 1930s, as studios

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.000
merged or sold or split apart.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.480
Probably because of prohibition and they didn't have anything else to do.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.870
By the end of the era, most American films
were being made at studios whose names you

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.120
might recognize from the multiplex today:
not only United Artists and MGM, but also

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.980
Warner Brothers, Fox, Universal, and Columbia
Pictures.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.040
Now while the corporate structure of these
companies kept changing, the process by which

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.310
they were making films was becoming remarkably
stable and efficient. Unlike me.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.860
The major studios became very good at churning

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.300
out large-scale, commercial movies with mass
appeal.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.420
One of the leading innovators in setting up
the way studios worked was a man named Thomas H. Ince.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.400
Like D.W. Griffith, Ince came to film as a failed actor.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.410
He directed his first film in 1910, and by
1913 he was making as many as 150 two-reelers

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.410
a year!

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.590
His biggest impact on film came by applying
the lessons of mass production to the actual

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.640
making of movies.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.250
Prior to Ince, most films were overseen by
a director-cameraman – a single person who

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.040
conceived the story, worked with the actors,
and operated the camera.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.220
Ince broke those roles into separate jobs:

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.040
A screenwriter to conceive the story and write the script.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.620
A director to make creative decisions on set
and work with the actors.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.180
An editor to assemble the footage.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.110
A producer to supervise the project from inception
to final cut.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.400
And a studio head to oversee the entire studio.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.480
While other filmmakers had played around with
these roles, it was Ince who standardized

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.760
them into a system – a system still used
today.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.290
By 1912, he’d earned enough money to buy
a ranch west of Hollywood where he built his

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.980
own studio, a place he called Inceville…

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.060
Yep!

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.920
It was here where the first permanent exterior
sets were built, made to resemble far flung

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.520
locations, like a cowboy saloon, a little
Swiss street, or a Japanese village.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.730
And as Ince worked to define the roles and
streamline the means of production, he was

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.570
able to triple the output of his studio.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.250
Though he died quite young in 1924, Ince’s
impact on film production was as thorough,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.250
widespread, and lasting.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.970
Now, Mack Sennett, another early film mogul
and one-time partner of Ince, was responsible

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.710
for discovering a whole slew of film legends,
whose names you might recognize.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.980
People like the Keystone Cops, Fatty Arbuckle,
Gloria Swanson, Carole Lombard, W.C.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.100
Fields, and… the great Charlie Chaplin.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.740
Let's talk a little bit about Charlie Chaplin.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.280
He was born into poverty in England
in 1889.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.700
He went into acting, signed with a prestigious
Vaudeville touring company, and set off for

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.180
America at age 19.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.340
A film talent scout spotted him there, got
him hired by Sennett, and the rest is history.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.340
That we're gonna talk about because we're talking about Film History.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.500
Smart, curious, and driven, it didn’t take
long for Chaplin to develop his iconic Tramp

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.500
persona and begin directing his own films.

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.181
After finishing his first film contract, Chaplin
struck an extremely lucrative deal with the

00:04:54.181 --> 00:04:57.220
Chicago-based Essanay Studios to make 14 short
films.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.720
While at Essanay, he found ways to combine
his finely tuned sense of empathy and his

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.280
recognizable Tramp character with a growing
ability to make audiences laugh – through

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.710
both physical comedy and increasingly clever
storylines.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.210
In fact, he was so popular that by the time
his Essanay contract was up in 1915, he negotiated

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.540
an almost unprecedented salary of $10,000
per week with another studio, the Mutual

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.540
Film Corporation.

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.360
They also paid him a signing bonus of $150,000
– the equivalent of about $3.5 million today.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.360
CHA-CHING! Is what they would have said at the time.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.340
The movies Chaplin made with Mutual brought
him international stardom.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.860
They marked the first time his focus on the
poor verged into social criticism, a place

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.300
silent comedies rarely, if ever, went.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.260
True to his roots – and despite being one
of the highest paid people in the world – Chaplin’s

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.560
films often focused on the gentle, accidental
heroism of the downtrodden.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.639
Time and again, he made the powerful the butt
of his jokes and displayed tremendous empathy

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.930
for the poor and the humble.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.670
Then in 1919, at age 30, he co-founded United
Artists in an effort to exercise greater control

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.580
over his films.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.400
I'm 36... I better get moving.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.060
What followed was a string of classic movies
that rank not only among Chaplin’s best,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.730
but among the best film comedies of all time:
The Kid – his first feature film and a smash

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.700
hit – The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern
Times, and his controversial take-down of

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.440
Adolf Hitler, The Great Dictator.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.800
His later career would be hampered by legal
problems and socialist sympathies, which would

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.880
land him on the infamous post-war blacklist,
and keep him from making films.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.290
But at his height, no one benefited more from
the Silent Era studio system than Charlie

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:18.860
Chaplin – as a director, making a lot of
films quickly and efficiently; and as an actor,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.639
commanding enormous salaries and unheard-of
creative control.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.419
And he wasn’t the only one to turn this
system to his advantage.

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.340
Actor-directors like Buster Keaton, “Fatty”
Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd achieved great

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.860
success making their own short and feature-length
comedies.

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:34.100
Stars from Mary Pickford to Gloria Swanson
parlayed their celebrity into tangible behind-the-scenes power.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.100
Now, as film became more and more central
to popular culture, some people started to

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.100
get nervous.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.590
They worried that movies posed a real threat
to public morality.

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.880
They saw films promoting materialism, cynicism,
sexual license.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.700
This would be a debate that would
come up again and again in American culture

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.660
– about movies or music or video games.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.580
Until now when we've solved all those problems.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.600
Is the medium causing society’s problems,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.610
or just reflecting them?

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.131
A few real-life Hollywood scandals at the
time tipped the scales, bringing on the first

00:06:57.131 --> 00:06:59.280
real self-censorship of American cinema.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.220
The gossip press fed readers stories about
stars dealing with addictions, affairs, and worse.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.760
The most famous of these centered around Fatty
Arbuckle, who was accused of the rape and

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.170
accidental death of an actress named Virginia
Rappe.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.650
Although he was ultimately acquitted after
three highly-publicized trials, the scandal

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.030
itself all but ended Arbuckle’s career,
and left an opening for a government crackdown

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.270
on immorality in films and the film business.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.220
Rather than wait for Congress to get involved,
the major players in the film industry banded

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.530
together to form the MPPDA – the Motion
Picture Producers and Distributors of America.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.510
They hired a retired Postmaster General named
Will Hays, a conservative Evangelical, to

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.440
prove they were serious about cleaning up
their act.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.370
And that’s exactly what Hays did in 1930,
putting together the Motion Picture Production

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.060
Code, also known as the Hays Code, a catalogue
of things filmmakers could and couldn’t show on screen.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.940
...fun.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.060
The Code also suggested a strategy called
Compensating Values.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.479
The idea was that films could show characters
engaging in vice for most of the film, as

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:49.430
long as virtue triumphed in the end.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.229
No one employed this technique better than
director Cecile B. DeMille.

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:55.620
He was a master at giving the audience all
the vice and excess they could handle for

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.470
the first three quarters of the movie, before
virtue came out on top.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.710
Other filmmakers found their own ways around
the Hays Code.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.949
German director Ernst Lubitsch came to Hollywood
in 1922 and made a successful series of witty

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:08.570
sex comedies that relied on suggestion and
innuendo rather than skin.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:12.290
For many of these filmmakers, however, the
Hays Code was about to become the least of

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.290
their worries.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:17.190
A seismic event was poised to shake up Hollywood,
and not every filmmaker of the Silent Era

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:19.800
was going to come out the other side with
their career intact.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.920
The world was about to get its first taste
of synchronous sound.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.860
And it tasted good... maybe, I don't know.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.240
Today, we explored the Silent Era, the first
golden age of Hollywood filmmaking.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.450
We learned about the innovations of Thomas
Ince and the rise of the American film studio.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.729
And we discussed some of the most important
Silent Era filmmakers and how their scandals

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:41.110
– both real and imagined – led Hollywood
to institute industry standards governing

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.279
