00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.950
If you’ve been joining me from the beginning
of our journey through the history of film,

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.120
you might’ve noticed something.
None of the films that I’ve talked about

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.531
so far look like the movies you see today.
Yes, Ryan Gosling got very little play in

00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:14.680
the late 1800s. But what I really mean is:
We haven’t talked much about story. Character.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.840
Narrative.
Like, you don’t go the the megaplex today,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.480
buy a bunch of popcorn, and sit down to watch
movies of trains entering stations, or horses

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.520
running in slow motion.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.640
That’s because, there was a period in the history of film –

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.620
a really important and
kind of problematic one – when film evolved,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.920
from a technical curiosity into a powerful
visual storytelling machine.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.570
Artists, technicians, and engineers started
devising ways of making films longer, more

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.010
complex, and more narrative. This is when
it began to develop its own language, through

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.839
the power of editing.
And the way films were made, and watched,

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:42.870
became more familiar, too.
Film studios began to pop up. Movie theaters

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
proliferated. Systems were created to develop
film, shuttle movies from theater to theater,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.800
and publicize them to hungry audiences.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.519
As film’s physical and economic imprint became more stable, so too did its visual language, taking a shape that more closely

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.869
resembles the movies you see today.
And this was due in large part to the exhaustive

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:02.370
work of D. W. Griffith, a failed actor-turned-filmmaker
whose own legacy was as complicated and sprawling

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.220
as one of his films.
It’s time to tackle D. W. Griffith and the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.680
arrival of the feature film.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:19.680
[Opening Titles]

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.260
As the film industry took root, that whole
system began to take a shape that’s recognizable

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.200
to us modern movie-goers.
First, there’s the studio.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.120
When an entertainment company grows big enough
to have its own production facilities – from

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.320
offices and sound stages to props, costumes,
and editing rooms, we call it a studio. The

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.030
studio is where the films are made by the
production company.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.420
Second is the distributor. Its job is to market
the movie to its audience, book the films

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.860
onto screens, and then deliver them to the
theaters. So the distributor actually gets

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.340
the films out into the world.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520
Thank you, distributor. I like watching movies.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.780
Finally, we have the exhibitor. This is the company that actually provides the film to
the audience.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.220
Movie theaters and big theater chains are
exhibitors, as are streaming services and

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.550
DVD rental companies.
In the first few decades of film production

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.090
in the US, many of these companies were vertically
integrated. That means that the studio owned

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.600
the production company. And the distribution
company. And even the exhibition company.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.250
While this made a lot of sense for the owners of the studios – to be able to control the

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.700
process from production to exhibition – it
would eventually be ruled a monopoly.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.069
At that point, the studios would be forced
to break off their distribution and exhibition

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.600
businesses and open the field to competition.
But that came later. In the early days – from

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.770
about 1907 to 1913 – the major film studios
had tremendous power... like me.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.960
Eager to please a growing and ravenous audience,
these studios looked to the success that manufacturers

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.940
like Henry Ford were having with mass production,
and tried to make films in a kind of “assembly

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.400
line” process.
Write the film, shoot the film, edit the film,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.480
distribute the film, screen the film, and
repeat. As fast as possible, and as often

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.300
as possible. That's how you make art!

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.290
It was about quantity, not quality. If the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.980
movies were good, that was cool; but it wasn’t
the goal. Experimentation of any kind was

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.690
discouraged. Time was money.
The standard length of these films was about

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.550
10 to 16 minutes, or one reel of film. The
creative name they came up for these films?

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.750
“One reelers.”
But despite the flattening out of quality,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.430
this was a period of astronomical growth for
the film industry, in the US and western Europe

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.770
in particular.
Demand was through the roof, and filmmakers

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.170
were working overtime trying to meet it.
They were also stealing. Copyright law was

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.349
still in its infancy, and – as with books
prior to 1893 – most films were considered

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.730
to be in the public domain. This meant that
prints could be stolen and duplicated without

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.550
legal consequences.
It was kind of the Wild West, and it can be

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.940
as confusing to make sense of as it was to
live through. YEE-HAW!

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.860
So let’s see if we can work

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.459
our way through it.
The person in the best position to bring some

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.750
order to the chaos of this burgeoning film
industry is our old friend Thomas Edison.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.490
Edison claimed that he held the patents on
several elements in almost all motion picture

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.030
cameras and projectors. So he believed he
was entitled to a cut of every camera and

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.750
projector sold, as well as every movie that
was made, sold, or screened.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.569
And who was the competitor who most got under
his skin? His former lab assistant – and

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.370
the man who actually invented the first motion
picture camera – William Dickson.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.681
After he left Edison, Dickson started his
own production company called Biograph, which

00:03:46.681 --> 00:03:50.480
made films using a camera similar to Edison’s
kinetograph, but different enough to survive

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.550
a lawsuit.
And sue Edison did. No fewer than 20 times

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.360
in just a few years. I mean, Edison was suing everybody.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.900
This era became known as the Patent Wars,
as gangs of men connected to Edison were known

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.220
to show up at independent film studios and
threaten the filmmakers.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.260
Eventually Edison realized that he was wasting
time and money in court. Independent producers

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.530
and distributors were popping up all over
the place, and he was left playing this big,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.220
high-stakes game of whack-a-mole. Sounds like fun, but it's not... trust me.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.379
So he proposed a truce, and partnered with Dickson’s Biograph and eight other major
film studios, the country’s leading film

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:20.859
distributor, and George Eastman, the biggest
supplier of film stock.

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.169
Together, they created the Motion Picture
Patents Company, also known as “the Trust,”

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.509
an effective monopoly on film production and
distribution in the United States.

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:30.669
Instead of selling films to distributors and
exhibitors, studios would rent them out, and

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.289
retain all legal rights to them. This gave
studios control over which films were screened,

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.700
how often, and in which theaters. Sounds great! ... no it doesn't.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.340
Plus, because Eastman was a member of 
the MPCC, independent film companies couldn’t
get their hands on film stock without permission.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.340
Which meant that Edison got to decide who
could and couldn’t make movies!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.460
In addition to the stranglehold that the Trust
put on the industry, it also promoted the

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.370
assembly line process of film production.
As a result, the films themselves by and large

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.110
became unimaginative, stale, and static.
But, the independents refused to go quietly.

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.300
They banded together to form groups aimed
at resisting Edison and the MPPC. The last

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.479
and most successful of these was the Motion
Picture Distributing and Sales Company.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.070
Many of them also decided to move their production
facilities as far away from Edison’s New

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.360
Jersey headquarters as possible. Can you guess
where they ended up?... Not Synecdoche.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.449
That’s right: Hollywood, California, which
had the added benefits of year-round sunshine

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.800
and a diverse and handy assortment of natural landscapes. And earthquakes. That's not a benefit it's just something they had.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.819
Finally, in 1918, the United States Supreme
Court broke up the MPPC and ordered film studios

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.030
to sever their distribution and exhibition
branches, ending Edison’s run as American

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.050
film’s great gatekeeper.
While all this was going on, films themselves

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.520
were struggling to change, and though no one
knew it yet, features were on the way.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.870
A feature film is a movie with a running time
long enough to be considered the principal

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.849
film in a program. Usually, features clock
in at between 70 and 130 minutes.

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:51.339
When Edison’s posse was in control, the
MPPC strictly forbade films longer than one

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.559
reel, or 10 to 16 minutes.
So filmmakers began looking for creative ways

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:57.860
around the length restriction. Some would
make two reelers and then show them in a serial

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.180
format – the first reel this week, the second
next week.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.680
Sort of like what they did with the last Harry
Potter book. I’m still not over that.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.250
Three films in particular paved the way for
features by convincing studios that longer

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:08.899
films could be commercially successful.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:13.449
The first was The Crusaders, an Italian film
from 1911 that was four reels long. The second

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.069
was another 4-reeler, a French film called
The Loves of Queen Elizabeth, that starred

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.490
megastar Sarah Bernhardt and made a ton of
money in 1912.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.529
And finally, Quo Vadis, a 1913 Italian spectacle
that boasted huge crowd scenes and big special

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:28.949
effects, and ran nine reels in length!
And working steadily through all of this was

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.530
a director named D. W. Griffith. The son of
a Confederate colonel, Griffith was a failed

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.249
stage actor who happened to be on an Edwin
S. Porter set one day and fell in love with

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:37.800
film.
Within a few months, he was directing one

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.620
reelers at an astonishing rate – he would
go on to make more than 450 in less than a

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.229
decade.
What’s even more impressive, he was able

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.559
to integrate an actor’s understanding of
nuance and character with the film grammar

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:49.889
laid down by pioneers like Porter.
He made incredible innovations in how a film

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:53.159
could be shot and cut. And most importantly,
he grounded all of his new techniques in the

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:56.370
service of character and story.
For example, Griffith is credited with innovating

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.249
the close-up – cutting to a shot of a character’s
face at a moment of high drama. This also

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:05.200
required – and rewarded – a more subtle
style of acting than film actors often delivered.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.200
Can we cut to a close up, Nick?
Nick: No.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.660
Drama, right? Are we in a close up?
Nick: No.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.400
Why?

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.920
He used insert shots – close-ups of objects
or characters’ hands – to draw attention

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:16.800
to symbolic props or key narrative moments.
He used increasingly extensive flashbacks

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.740
to add depth to characters and their stories.
And he found ingenious ways to use cross-cutting

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.699
to engage the audience on a deep level, to
make us empathize with his characters, to

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:26.179
really care about what was happening to them.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.409
It’s remarkable how modern his films feel
today. So I'm gonna remark on it.

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.920
Sure, they’re in black and white, and they’re short, and they don’t star
Captain America or Vin Diesel’s car or an

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.800
Oscar-worthy bucket of tears.
But the way the shots are framed and arranged

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.219
hasn’t changed all that much since Griffith.
And Griffith’s biggest achievement was the

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:43.139
film Birth of a Nation.
This is the film that paved the way for feature-length

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:46.699
films to become the gold standard. It was
successful enough – both financially and

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.389
in terms of its massive scope mixed with its
detailed attention to character, emotion,

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.930
and story – that audiences demanded more
like it, and would no longer be satisfied

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.069
with a program of half a dozen one reelers.
Birth of a Nation is also a deeply racist

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:01.559
film. It offers an extremely sympathetic view
of white southern former slaveholders under

00:08:01.559 --> 00:08:03.520
Reconstruction.
The heroes at the end of the film are the

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.219
reborn Ku Klux Klan, who ride across the countryside,
racing to save poor white southerners besieged

00:08:08.219 --> 00:08:11.479
by mobs of murderous former slaves.
It’s stunningly effective in its use of

00:08:11.479 --> 00:08:14.879
cross-cutting and screen direction; it’s
also profoundly disturbing in its message

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:17.529
and imagery.
This is the double-edged sword of D. W. Griffith:

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:22.219
a master of cinema on one hand, and an apologist
for a legacy of hatred, violence, and persecution,

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:25.370
whose work inspired actual hate groups to
reconstitute in this country.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.360
The film faced protests at the time, particularly
in places like Chicago, where people of all

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.529
ethnic backgrounds objected to its twisted
view of history and race relations.

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:36.260
And there was a very small but vibrant underground
African American film industry at the time

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:39.450
that responded to the racism of Birth of a Nation with films of their own.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.310
Most famous was Oscar Micheaux’s Within
Our Gates, released in 1920, the story of

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.460
a mixed-race school teacher who encounters
violence and prejudice as she tries to make

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.410
a better life for herself.
The most successful African American filmmaker

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:52.720
of the time, Micheaux examined the racial
climate in the United States in a way that’s

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.510
as nuanced and searing as Griffith’s is
bigoted and inaccurate.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:59.160
Whatever else it is, Birth of a Nation marked
the end of the Silent Shorts era, and challenged

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.450
film studios to allow filmmakers to make longer,
more complex films that told grand stories

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.350
with unique characters and powerful emotions.
The pictures may have moved before Griffith,

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.680
but now the audience was moved too.
Today we talked about how the film industry

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.340
is divided up into studios, distributors,
and exhibitors – and how all those systems

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.780
used to be controlled by the same people.
Then, we discussed the independent filmmakers

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.780
who resisted the monopolies, started up Hollywood,
and began creating longer feature films instead

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.580
of one reelers. We introduced D.W. Griffith who was an innovator and master of film language,

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:30.620
but his biggest achievement was a film cloaked in hate and racism.
