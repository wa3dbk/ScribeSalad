00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.620
The earliest days of film were possibly when
cinema was its most global as a medium.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.790
There was no synchronous sound, so filmmakers
had to tell their stories visually – with

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.000
tools like framing, shot size, and editing
– instead of with spoken dialogue.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.940
Because of this, films could be understood
across cultures: Someone throws a punch at

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.680
the camera, and you flinch, whether you speak
English or Russian... or Eagle.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.900
So far, we’ve been focusing a lot on France
and the United States, where many advances

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.419
in film technology, storytelling, and commerce
were born.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.529
But the rest of the world wasn’t very far
behind.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.501
Europe had a vibrant film culture leading
right up to 1914, and the outbreak of World

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:36.700
War I, which profoundly changed world history - as world wars tend to do -

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.420
and left an impact on cinema that’s still felt to this day.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.140
German film, especially, became stranger and
darker, as filmmakers attempted to disorient

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.340
the audience and immerse us in the heads of
their main characters.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.140
It’s time to delve into the psychological
depths of German Expressionism.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:01:02.460
[OPENING MUSIC PLAYS]

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.920
When you think of World War I, you might think
of trench warfare, chemical weapons, or a

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.760
war that began with an assassin’s bullet.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.740
But the war’s effect on the burgeoning global
film industry – as well as its political

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.490
and psychological influence on emerging filmmakers
– was deep and powerful.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.979
In countries like France, Italy, and the U.K.,
World War I brought feature film production

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.049
to a near-standstill, because the infrastructure
and facilities were destroyed, or because

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.360
the filmmakers and their equipment were conscripted
into the war effort.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.200
You see, film was used to bring images of
battle and its aftermath to audiences far

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.200
from the front lines.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.770
The two national film industries most affected
by World War I were those of Germany and Russia.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.100
For now, let’s focus on Germany.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.289
We’ll get to Russia next time.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.380
Prior to the war, German films fell firmly
within our idea of a “cinema of attractions”

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.680
– they were spectacles designed for entertainment.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680
Like me.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.000
As film became a more sophisticated medium,
many German filmmakers took a page from the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.240
French “film d’art” movement.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.700
They began thinking more about the craft of
narrative filmmaking, telling more complex

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.940
stories rooted in specific characters’ experiences.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.240
Sounds boring to me. Where are the explosions, am I right?

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.219
And they called this kind of film Autorenfilm,
or “famous author’s film.”

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:05.539
In 1913, director Stellan Rye made a film
called Der Student von Prag, or The Student

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.259
from Prague, that finally unshackled German
film from theatrical staging – the Proscenium

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.010
arch approach we talked about before.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.060
This freed the camera to enter a scene and
join the action, rather than sitting back to observe.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.900
By the mid-1910s, the German government realized
that its film industry wasn’t at the same

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.239
level as that of the United States, France,
Italy, or England.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.340
Combine that with the country’s struggles
with pre-war depression and anti-government

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.379
propaganda, and you had a recipe for trouble.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.650
In 1917, the German military supreme command
took control of all the major film studios

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.280
and production companies and consolidated
them under one, enormous, state-sponsored

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.470
entity called UFA.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.290
The idea was to centralize all the film talent,
equipment, and facilities in the country,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.329
and to focus on nationalist films – a pro-German,
pro-government cinema that would help them

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.329
win the war.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.860
Imagine if the U.S. military took over and
combined Warner Brothers, Paramount, Disney,

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.970
Universal, Fox, Sony, Canon Films (Breakin' 2:Electric Boogaloo?) – all the major
film studios.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.530
And then told them what they could and couldn’t
make.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.150
That’s a lot of resources, and a lot of
power.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.530
Now, Germany lost the war… badly.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.340
And in the aftermath, Imperial rule ended
and a national assembly in the city of Weimar

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.220
gave birth to a new republican government.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.180
This era in German history – which we call
the Weimar Period – was marked by hyperinflation,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.879
political extremism, violence, and deeply
troubled relationships with the countries

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.879
that had won the war.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.439
But Germany was left with a huge infrastructure
for film production and distribution that

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.709
actually grew during the war, while the rest
of the economy went into a free fall.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.300
Meanwhile, the rest of Europe’s filmmaking
capacity had been all but decimated.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.930
So by 1920, Germany had the only film industry
in the world able to compete with Hollywood.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.079
The first post-war films made by UFA were
beautiful costume dramas, or “Kostumfilme.” -- Aptly Named.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.609
Their aim was to compete with the popular,
large-scale historical spectacles made by

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.739
Italy before the war, to entertain and distract
audiences from the devastated economy.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.709
A filmmaker named Ernst Lubitsch became the
acknowledged master of the Kostumfilme, known

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.540
for his huge crowd scenes and mastery of artificial
lighting.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.880
Hopefully known for his costumes, too. I would think. I mean, it's a Kostumfilme. You better have costumes.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.770
His first big international hit was Madame
DuBarry, also known as Passion, made in 1919.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.420
And in just over a decade, he would become
the first high-profile German director to

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.200
emigrate to Hollywood to escape the rise of
Nazi rule.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.989
Now, with UFA sucking up all the filmmaking
oxygen in Germany, there wasn’t much room

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.670
for independent production companies.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.989
And yet a few persisted.

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:18.620
One of them, called Decla, knew they couldn’t
compete with UFA in terms of scale or resources.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.739
They were even hamstrung by the rationing
of electricity, which limited the lighting

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:22.739
they could use.

00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:25.259
So the producers knew they had to do something
different to get people’s attention

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.259
– and they did.

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.680
Their breakout film would reshape the German
film style, and eventually influence the look

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.730
and tone of Hollywood genre movies.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.080
It was called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.980
This little studio, made a movie that changed the face of cinema!

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.740
Written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer, this
film was thematically based on their experiences

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.050
as soldiers in World War I and their distrust
of authoritarian leadership.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.020
It tells the story of a young German man who
meets a madman doctor whose somnambulist – a

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.699
kind of sleepwalking zombie – may also be
a serial killer, targeting the young man’s

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.170
best friend and the woman he loves.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.380
The story gains a level of complexity at the
end when it’s revealed that...

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.150
Spoiler... get ready.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.160
– our hero is an unreliable narrator.

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.900
He lives in a mental institution and may have
made up the entire plot using his fellow inmates

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.550
and the director of the asylum as models for
his characters.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.550
Creepy, right?

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.289
What made the film stand out in 1920, and
even today, is its use of mise-en-scène.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.570
Mise-en-scène refers to the arrangement of
things that appear in front of the camera.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.140
All the physical stuff in a shot: the sets,
props, costumes, makeup, actors and their

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.669
blocking, and the lighting.

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:21.669
Pretty much everything.

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.100
And Caligari’s innovation was to use mise-en-scène
expressionistically, rather than realistically.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.250
That is, instead of making things like the
sets, costumes, and props, as realistic as

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.199
possible, director Robert Weine and his two
production designers deliberately distorted

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.259
everything within the frame.

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.960
It’s all designed to look deliberately artificial
and throw you off balance – from chairs,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.900
desks, and doors that are way too tall, to
impossibly peaked roofs, and even shafts of

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.630
moonlight painted across the set.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.550
The pale-faced, dark-eyed makeup of the characters,
as well as they way they move – particularly

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.890
the sleepwalking killer Cesare – is meant
to be super creepy.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.690
This is the heart of German Expressionism,
using an exaggerated, distorted mise-en-scène

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.949
to reflect the inner psychology of the characters.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.199
It’s the world’s first taste of highly
subjective filmmaking as well – putting

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.289
us in the mind of an insane main character
and making us experience the world as he does.

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:08.340
Given its anti-authoritarian themes, exaggerated
mise-en-scène, subjective point of view,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.169
and twist ending, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
is a powerhouse of a story.

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.940
It made at least four breakthroughs all at
once for the history of film.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.350
And although Caligari wasn’t an immediate
hit, other filmmakers soon began to pick up

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.350
its techniques.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.800
Even UFA started to borrow its style.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.540
And, before long, expressionistic mise-en-scène
became a hallmark of German cinema in the

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:25.599
Weimar Period.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.740
Because UFA was the largest film studio in
the world at the time, it attracted young

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.920
filmmakers and technicians from all over Europe
– including a 25-year-old Alfred Hitchcock.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.060
Then, as Germany took a hard right toward
fascism, many German filmmakers fled for London,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.449
New York, or Hollywood, taking the techniques
of German Expressionism with them.

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.840
Watch a film noir from the 1930s or a horror
film from the 1940s, or even a studio melodrama

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.229
like Douglas Sirk’s All that Heaven Allows
from 1955, and you’ll see the deep influence

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.230
of German Expressionism.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.629
Heck, take another look at David Fincher’s
Se7en, and tell me those grisly murder scenes

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.080
and that ending would exist without Caligari.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.120
WHAT'S IN THE BOOOOOOX?!?!

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:00.880
Now, another German filmmaker from the Weimar
Period we should talk about is Fritz Lang.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.940
Lang started as an architect, and, boy, does
it show in his work.

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.849
His films depict grand, epic spaces, and he
pays incredibly close attention to the details

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:08.900
and structure of his narratives.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.680
They feel solid, like you could live in them.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.139
He borrowed heavily from Caligari’s use
of mise-en-scène to amplify his own rich

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:15.650
and morally-complex stories.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.009
But his films were less intellectual, and
more interested in exploring the visceral

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:20.310
emotions of characters.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.620
Lang’s masterpiece is the sci-fi epic Metropolis,
which combined German Expressionist techniques

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.340
with his interest in special effects.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.090
The film is set in a futuristic society, in
which the wealthy live in luxury high above

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:31.160
the toiling masses.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:34.780
It’s a love story between the son of the
ruler of this society, and a poor worker from

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.330
down below – which, y’know, is par for
the course in dystopian stories.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.520
Metropolis was a precursor to everything from
Blade Runner to The Hunger Games, but it was

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.569
also a huge financial failure at the time.

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:46.610
It took decades before it was hailed as a
dark and sinister classic.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.319
Now, no discussion of German Expressionism
is complete without mentioning the other major

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.349
director of the time: F.W. Murnau.

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:55.610
Murnau was an art historian before he was
a filmmaker, and wanted to make a film of

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:58.330
Bram Stoker’s Dracula, but couldn’t afford
the rights to the book.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:07:59.819
So he just… fudged it a bit.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:03.360
He changed some of the names, rearranged some
locations, and made his own version of the

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.610
same story in 1922, called Nosferatu.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.169
He was heavily inspired by Caligari, but instead
of building exaggerated sets, Murnau focused

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:13.599
more on lighting, staging, special effects,
and makeup to get at the characters’ inner

00:08:13.599 --> 00:08:14.599
psychology.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.189
Murnau would eventually turn his attention
to Kammerspielfilm, or the “Intimate Theater”

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:22.280
film tradition, which tried to depict the
oppressiveness of middle class life in
contemporary Germany.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.520
He remained as experimental as ever, particularly
with camera movement.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.680
His 1924 film The Last Laugh, for instance,
is a masterclass in what Murnau called the

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:31.000
“unchained camera.”

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.990
From pans and tilts to dolly and crane shots,
his camera never stops moving, in an attempt

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:36.980
to make us feel what his characters are feeling.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.880
Can you move our camera around for the rest of the video, Nick?

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.440
Nick: No.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.880
That... that's fine.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.380
That same year, the United States and its
European allies implemented the Dawes Plan,

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.640
to try and help Germany pay for the extensive
damage it caused during the war.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.080
So the extra aid from the Dawes Plan was good
for the German economy overall, but it was

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.700
a gut punch to the film industry.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.070
Among other things, it strangled exports,
meaning that German films had a much harder

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.140
time finding distribution outside of the country.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:05.371
That in turn made it harder for production
companies to get loans from the banks, so

00:09:05.371 --> 00:09:09.700
many independent companies ended up declaring
bankruptcy between 1924 and 1925.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.339
American film studios saw the chance to take
out their greatest rivals, and flooded Germany

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:14.490
with Hollywood films.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.950
Germany’s days as a leader in global cinema
were over.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.800
That said, German cinema of the Weimar period
has had a profound and long-lasting influence

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.120
on film history, like few other movements
have.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.529
From The Silence of the Lambs to Don’t Breathe
to anything M. Night Shyamalan has ever put

00:09:26.529 --> 00:09:30.330
on film, the techniques of German Expressionism
are creeping us out to this very day.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:34.450
Today we talked about how the political climate
during and after World War I influenced filmmakers

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.740
across the world and the German film industry.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.640
We learned about styles and techniques that
emerged from this post-war society, like German

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.350
Expressionism’s exaggerated mise-en-scène
and Murnau’s “unchained camera”.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.491
And we looked at how filmmakers like Weine,
Lubitsch, and Lang taught the world to use

00:09:47.491 --> 00:09:51.120
these tools of cinema to bring audiences more
directly into the minds of characters.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.160
Next time, we’ll witness how the Russian
Revolution incited a lot of filmmaking study

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:58.620
and innovation too – especially in editing
– and delve into the theory of Soviet Montage.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.180
