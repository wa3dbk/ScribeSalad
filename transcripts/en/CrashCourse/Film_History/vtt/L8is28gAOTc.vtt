00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.980
When’s the last time you heard a really
good story?

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.069
Maybe it was was a TV show that made you dream
of discovering aliens as a kid, or a book

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.990
that completely changed how you think about
yourself.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.420
We’re all hardwired to make sense of the
world by telling and being told stories, and

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.470
at the turn of the 20th century, motion pictures
were starting to do just that.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.130
At first, seeing any film was thrilling
in and of itself, whether it was a Vaudeville

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.480
performer flexing or a train pulling up to
a station.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.460
But just five or six years into the history
of film, audiences were looking for something

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.720
more than just a technological marvel. So, filmmakers had to "try". Ugh...

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.370
The world was primed for artists to prove
this medium was more than just a passing fad.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.340
And along came a storyteller who would make
his own magic, take us to the moon, and jumpstart

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.050
the first special effects revolution.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.290
He changed what filmmakers and audiences believed
was possible, both onscreen and off.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.180
It was time for Georges Méliès.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:57.720
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.960
As the 19th century gave way to the 20th,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.500
artists, engineers, and self-taught tinkerers
were all pushing the boundaries of film.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.980
"Self-Taught-Tinkerer?" My nickname in high school.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.280
Technical innovations like the Latham Loop
allowed filmmakers to use longer film strips

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.920
in cameras, without them tearing and breaking.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.070
Now they could create longer, more complex
films, which facilitated the very first experiments

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.070
with editing.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.970
Editing, also known as cutting, is the assembling
of shots to achieve coherence: whether that’s

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.840
in the narrative, in space, in time, symbolically,
or thematically.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.070
There are all kinds of ways to join shots
together.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.770
You can use transitions like fades, wipes,
or dissolves,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.660
or you can just cut straight from one shot
to another. Like this...

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.560
Ya... see that?

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.460
We’ll explore editing techniques in more
detail later in Crash Course Film, and dive

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.500
deep into their psychological, emotional,
and even political implications.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.030
For now, all you need to know is that filmmakers
were starting to join shots together, inching

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.130
their way toward narrative-based films that
explicitly told stories.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.479
One of these soon-to-be filmmakers was Georges
Méliès.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.600
He was born in Paris in 1861, and first achieved
fame as a stage magician.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.640
If you’re familiar with Christopher Nolan’s
The Prestige – his other movie with Christian

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.170
Bale – it’ll come as no surprise that
stage magicians were huge celebrities at the

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.040
turn of the century.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.940
Also, David Bowie played Tesla in that movie. And that was awesome.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.040
Stage magicians entertained large crowds with illusions

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.100
and magic tricks, and decked out their acts
with elaborate sets, costumes, and characters.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.229
And most importantly for us, wove their larger
acts around stories.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.700
By all accounts, Georges Méliès was skilled
and successful.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.120
He owned and operated his own theater, the
Théâtre Robert-Houdin, where he acted as

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.770
writer, producer, and director, and designed
the sets and costumes himself.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.640
While Muybridge, Edison, and the Lumière
Brothers were tinkering with motion picture

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.450
devices, Méliès was developing magic tricks,
from sophisticated sight gags to theatrical

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.450
special effects.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.670
One of his specialties involved using a lantern
projection device to project light effects

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.540
onto the audience, making it seem to rain
or snow inside the theater... whoa...

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.920
Méliès was invited to one of the Lumière
Brothers’ private cinématographe screenings

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.470
before they officially revealed their device
to the world, and he was awestruck.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.320
He tried to buy one of their inventions on
the spot,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.700
but the Lumières weren’t ready to sell.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.710
Méliès didn’t give up, though.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.880
He could already see all the possibilities
a motion picture camera and projector held

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.790
for stage magic, and vice versa.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.100
After an intense, transcontinental search,
Méliès ended up buying an Animatograph,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.080
Then, get this, he reverse-engineered the Animatograph
so it worked as its own camera, too.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.250
And by April, 1896, he was making and screening
his own films in his theater.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.080
At first, his films looked like Edison’s
or the Lumière Brothers’ – continuous

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.170
shots of short skits, quick magic tricks,
or scenes from everyday life.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.480
But then along came one of those happy accidents
that moved cinema forward.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.230
In his autobiography, Méliès describes a
day he was capturing footage on a Paris street

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.270
when his camera jammed.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.470
Frustrated, he fiddled with the hand crank,
fixed the problem, and started shooting again

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.790
after a couple seconds had passed.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.480
When he developed the film later and played
it back, the most amazing thing had happened.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.430
The shot started with people walking, children
skipping, and a horse-drawn omnibus full of

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.209
workers trundling up the street.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.450
Then, in the blink of an eye, everything changed.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.390
Men turned into women, children were replaced
by horses, and – spookiest of all – the

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.739
omnibus full of workers changed into a hearse.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.599
In an instant, Méliès realized what had
happened.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:45.220
When his camera jammed, it stopped shooting
for a moment, and then started capturing images

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.330
again after he fixed it.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.660
When the whole sequence was projected, those
two “shots” were joined in an instant

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.290
and – poof! – magic happened before his
eyes.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.180
Méliès had found a way to perform actual
magic with editing, to fool an audience and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.650
pull off illusions he’d never been able
to on stage.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.190
He began making “trick films” with a vengeance,
using the power of editing and special effects

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.250
to do the impossible on screen: like levitating
heads, making people disappear, or changing

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.250
an object’s size or shape.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.879
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to reveal
a few of this magician’s secrets!

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:15.840
Méliès pioneered the first double exposure
in 1898, by running the film negative through

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.759
the camera twice before developing it.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:21.680
When you do this correctly, both images appear
on screen simultaneously, though the second

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.770
image usually appears faded or ghostly.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.379
This technique led him to invent the split
screen, in which he covered half the frame,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.720
shot his footage, rewound the film, covered
the other half of the frame, and shot new footage.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.400
When the film was developed, the two images
appeared side-by-side in real time.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.500
This was a trick he used over and over again,
often to allow actors to perform opposite themselves.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.920
It's a great technique that many youtubers use.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.460
He further refined this trick with a process

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.380
called matting, where he’d paint black shapes
on a glass plate attached to the lens of the camera.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.020
Those black shapes kept light from exposing
those portions of the film as he shot a scene.

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.229
Then, Méliès could paint the other portions
of the glass plate, while leaving the original

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.370
shapes clear, re-shoot the scene, and both
exposures would combine.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.490
We call these techniques in-camera effects
because they’re produced inside the camera,

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.080
rather than after the film has been shot.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:05.700
And Melies used them and many others to masterful
effect.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:06.620
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.500
The laws of physics were no match for Méliès
and his camera and editing tricks.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.860
No match for me either. Can you make me float up?

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.860
Nick (off camera): We can't do that.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.320
...or something.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.400
He could manipulate time.

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.419
He could manipulate space.

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.780
And he could harness the fact that all film
presents an illusion, to push his own illusions

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.780
even further.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.919
Before long, Méliès began incorporating
elements of his theatrical shows into his

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.190
films – the elaborate costumes, the lavish
sets, the exaggerated props, /and/ the stories.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.470
To our eyes today, his films have a distinct
“stagey” quality.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.119
By that I mean, the camera is almost always
set back from the action, capturing an entire

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:40.669
scene in one shot, roughly from the perspective
of an audience member in a theater.

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.849
We call this style of framing Proscenium Arch,
named for the arch over the front of the stage

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:44.849
in a theater.

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.259
It’s not used as much today, but you might
recognize the style from Wes Anderson movies.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.680
To us, the scenes in Méliès’ films might
feel static and too long, because, outside

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.259
of all his special effects editing, he only
cuts between scenes.

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.729
Not to mention, his characters might seem
one-dimensional, and their gestures can feel

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:58.729
over-the-top.

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.080
But put yourself in the shoes of a filmgoer
in 1901 Paris, having seen nothing but slice-of-life

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.659
actualitiés and Vaudeville performers on
screen.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:09.740
The relative sophistication, ambitious vision,
and powerful special effects of Méliès films

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.160
would be downright thrilling.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.460
But Méliès wasn’t the only filmmaker at work during the very first years of cinema.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.900
Alice Guy-Blaché was a secretary for the major French film company Gaumont, who went on to become their head of production.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.220
The first known female filmmaker, Guy-Blaché directed more than 1,000 films,

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.200
was a pioneer in color tinting, rudimentary sound and picture sync, and ultimately opened her own film studio.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.920
Blanche also worked on the cutting edge of narrative fiction, like with her film The Cabbage Fairy,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.580
before she eventually lost her company and stopped making films altogether in 1920.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.280
In 1902, Méliès released his masterpiece,
A Trip to the Moon, loosely

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.940
based on the Jules Verne novel.

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.850
This 14-minute film follows a group of scientists
who travel to the moon, sleep under the stars,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:48.720
battle some aliens, and escape back to Earth
triumphant.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.780
Even if you haven’t seen the whole thing,
you probably know the iconic image of the

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.000
“man in the moon” with the space capsule
stuck in his eye.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.189
A Trip to the Moon was made up of 825 feet
of film – three times the average length

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:00.099
of Edison or Lumière films of the time.

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.279
This film incorporates many of Méliès’
innovations – his trick photography, his

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:07.680
fantastical settings, and his ambitious storytelling
– all in service of a large scale, relatively

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.159
complex, narrative fiction film.

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:10.560
It was a massive international success.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.139
In fact, it made so much money that Thomas
Edison – among others – made illegal copies

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.889
of it and lined his pockets screening the
film as his own... what a guy!

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:19.180
But it wasn’t just a financial hit.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.789
It also had a profound effect on other filmmakers
of the time, and expanded what people thought

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:24.580
was possible, narratively and aesthetically.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.849
Not only could films take us into space and
let us battle with aliens, but they could

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:33.460
also sustain our attention for almost 15 minutes
and tell stories that unfolded over multiple scenes.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.460
A Trip to the Moon gets referenced
everywhere from Martin Scorsese’s Hugo,

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:40.240
which features a loving portrait of Georges
Méliès, to the Smashing Pumpkins’ 1996

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.140
music video for Tonight, Tonight.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.940
And perhaps, most importantly

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.380
Matthew Gaydos’ arm.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.429
Okay you can leave now, Matt.

00:07:47.429 --> 00:07:50.280
A Trip to the Moon was by no means the only
film Méliès made.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:55.080
In his prime, he made between 25 and 75 films
per year, a huge number by any standard.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.569
He founded a production company called Star
Film and built a large studio in Montreuil, France,

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:00.030
just outside Paris.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:03.589
The studio was constructed like a giant greenhouse,
to let in as much natural light as possible.

00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:06.590
And it was big enough to house Méliès’
massive painted sets and backdrops.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.909
And though we’re decades away from color
film stock, audiences were already seeing

00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:11.009
films with color in them.

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.349
To achieve this effect, individual frames
of film were hand-tinted or painted – to

00:08:14.349 --> 00:08:17.029
color an explosion orange or a dress red or
the sun yellow.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.830
It was a costly, time-consuming process, and
had to be repeated with every copy of the film.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.830
And I'm glad I didn't have to do it.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.929
For a showman like Méliès, however, no bit
of magic was too elaborate.

00:08:25.929 --> 00:08:30.429
It’s even said he employed twenty-one women to hand-tint his films at what must have cost a pretty penny.

00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:31.659
I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:35.300
Sadly, the high cost of his productions, legal
challenges from rivals, and the devastation

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.550
of Europe during World War I forced Méliès
out of the film business by 1917.

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:42.510
In the 1920s, he was living in obscurity,
selling sweets at the Montparnasse station

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.750
in Paris, as anyone who’s seen Hugo knows.

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:48.090
Had his story ended there, it would’ve been
a tragedy.But this is the movie business.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.300
And there’s nothing we like better than
a comeback story.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.880
In the late 1920s, journalists and filmmakers
who’d been influenced by Méliès’ films

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.500
tracked him down to celebrate his contributions
to the art of cinema.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.860
Someday I hope people track me down and do that... for me.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.140
And in October, 1931, Méliès was made a

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.530
Knight of the Legion of Honor, the highest
achievement in French military or civil affairs.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.890
The medal was presented to him by Louis Lumière
himself.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:14.250
So Georges Méliès, the Parisian stage magician
who brought science fiction, special effects,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.060
and more sophisticated narrative storytelling
to film, was ultimately honored by those who

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.340
knew his work the best.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.820
Both his peers and his rivals agreed that
his illusions changed history and took audiences

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.630
to new and thrilling places.

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:28.000
Places like the moon... and Matthew Gaydos' arm.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.770
Today we introduced Georges Méliès, the
magician-turned-filmmaker whose mistakes,

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:36.330
experiments, and ambitious storytelling led
to some huge advancements in early film production.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.130
We discussed how editing and special effects
can enhance the very nature of film as an

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.490
illusion, and how audiences were hungry for
longer, more complex narratives.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.390
And next time, we’ll learn about some more
experimentation with editing techniques, and

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:52.020
a filmmaker who started to define the visual
language of film as we know it today. Wheezy Waiter, not Wheezy Waiter.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.670
