00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.210
What’s playing at the multiplex today?

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.420
Another big-budget sequel?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.000
The same old romantic comedy?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.620
Yet another superhero movie? ...probably that last one.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.580
A lot of the time, Hollywood is driven by
trends.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.940
The success of one film or genre inspires
others to jump on the bandwagon.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.750
And that’s how we end up with nothing but
reboots and dystopian fantasies.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.970
The same thing happened after World War II.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.930
Audiences around the globe were getting tired
of the films coming out of Hollywood… calling

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.410
them artificial, self-important, and inauthentic.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.460
From the Italians in the 1940s to the French
in the 1960s, and even independent directors

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.140
at work today, filmmakers have found ways
to challenge the classical Hollywood model

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.390
by creating their own vibrant and original
films.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.740
So let’s talk about Italian Neo-Realism,
the French New Wave, and all kinds of independent cinema.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.460
Are we going to talk about Sharknado?
Nick: No.
Craig: Okay good!

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:59.480
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.560
Between the 1930s and 1950s, the major American

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.180
film studios perfected a particular style
of filmmaking we call classical Hollywood cinema.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.700
Their stories were chaste, formulaic, and
mostly upbeat.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.670
The good guys almost always won, and husbands
and wives couldn’t even share a bed.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.740
Many of the films were shot on constructed
sets or the studio’s backlot.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.319
And most used a flat, generic form of lighting
called high key lighting that ensured the

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:21.909
entire image was clearly visible.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.060
A lot of great films came out of the studio
system, but Hollywood was churning out between

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.479
six- and eight-hundred films a year and dominating
the global film market.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.639
By the mid-1940s, audiences were ready for
something new.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:34.849
The first post-World War II movement to find
its voice was Italian Neo-Realism.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.740
Many of its filmmakers, like Roberto Rossellini
and Vittorio de Sica, were working directors

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.840
before the war and started shooting again
as soon as the fighting ended.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.039
After living through that violent time, they
craved a more raw and authentic style than

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.200
classical Hollywood cinema could provide.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.989
Filmmaking tools for these guys ran thin:
Cinecittà, the film studio in Rome, was nearly

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:54.710
destroyed during the war, equipment was often
damaged or missing, and film stock was hard

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.710
to come by.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.069
But these resourceful Italian filmmakers found
a way to turn these disadvantages into a style

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:01.409
that reflected the harsh reality they saw
around them.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.700
The first Italian Neo-Realist film was Roberto
Rossellini’s 1945 masterpiece Rome: Open City.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.700
Set and shot in the Italian capital just after
the end of the war, the film tells the tragic

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.570
story of a handful of characters living under
Nazi occupation.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.990
Rossellini mixed non-actors with movie stars
and filmed in and around buildings that had

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.990
actually been bombed.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.689
The film has an extremely rough look, a plot
that meanders from character to character,

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.209
unexpected and shocking deaths, and an ambiguous
ending.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.360
Nothing about it screams “classical Hollywood,” and that’s what helped turned it into a hit.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.520
Other Italian Neo-Realists followed Rossellini’s
example, focusing on stories that tried to

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.550
reveal the authentic suffering of everyday
people.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.290
Then, nearly two decades later, another film
movement would take a different approach to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.670
the same problem: how do you make more authentic,
irreverent movies than Hollywood?

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.530
In the late 1950s in France, a group of opinionated
young film lovers started writing for a movie

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.320
magazine called Cahiers du cinema.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.150
At the time, the mainstream French film industry

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.500
was making a lot of unimaginative literary
adaptations that mimicked the classical Hollywood style.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.640
Films like Jean Delannoy’s The Little Rebels
and Rene Clement’s war drama Forbidden Games.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.010
And these young film critics hated them.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.180
In 1959, one of their most prominent writers,
Jean-Luc Godard, wrote a scathing attack on

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.040
21 major French directors.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.120
Here’s just part of what he said:
“Your camera movements are ugly because

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.590
your subjects are bad, your casts act badly
because your dialogue is worthless; in a word,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.360
you don’t know how to create cinema, because
you no longer know what it is.”

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.360
Ouch.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.180
The main argument of these critics was that
the studio systems – in both the United

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.370
States and France – were spoon-feeding their
audiences rather than respecting their intelligence.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.430
Interestingly, some of the filmmakers these
critics admired had worked in Hollywood

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.329
during the height of this studio system: directors
like John Ford, Howard Hawks, Orson Welles,

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.329
and Alfred Hitchcock.

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.120
And this was even before Hitchcock was Hitchcock.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.780
At the time, he was considered a reliable
maker of commercial thrillers.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.629
Successful, sure, but not a genius.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.939
These young French film critics, however,
saw a filmmaker entirely in command of his

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.730
medium – from story to cinematography to
editing.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.290
They also admired a few contemporary French
filmmakers, people like Alain Resnais

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.290
and Agnès Varda.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.599
Varda’s work, particularly her use of non-professional
actors, documentary realism, and real-life

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.540
locations, demonstrated that a vital, refreshing
French cinema was possible.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.200
By the end of the 1950s, they had analyzed
a boatload of contemporary cinema, and were

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.299
ready to start making films of their own.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.920
In 1959, four of them made their feature film
directing debuts: Jean-Luc Godard shot Breathless,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.750
Jacques Rivette made Paris Belongs to Us,
Claude Chabrol made his second film Les Cousins,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.090
and François Truffaut directed The 400 Blows.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.680
Truffaut’s film was selected to screen at
the hugely prestigious Cannes Film Festival,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.470
where Truffaut won Best Director.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.220
Suddenly, these scrappy young critics were
being recognized as major international film

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.180
stars, and it put French New Wave on the map.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.020
This style involved making films swiftly with
minimal crews and lightweight equipment.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.740
Like WheezyWaiter... actually no crew for Wheezy Waiter.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.860
Advances in camera technology, along with
faster film stocks, allowed them to shoot

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.680
with available or natural lighting, instead
of hauling around lights.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.510
The films’ plots often felt spontaneous
and absurd, featuring tangents, casual and

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.810
irreverent humor, a frank approach to sexuality,
and sometimes obscure cinematic references

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.810
and in-jokes.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.200
French the Llama, that’s neat!

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.830
They used a lot of tricks to remind audiences
they were watching a movie, to really play

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.800
with that illusion of reality – things like
jump-cuts or characters talking directly to the camera.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.880
Like WheezyWaiter.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.180
But their goal was to capture something really
authentic about life in post-war Europe.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.110
And even though the Italian Neo-Realism and
French New Wave styles got fancy names, this

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.050
shift wasn’t just happening in two countries.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.289
New generations of filmmakers began challenging
the classical Hollywood style all over the

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.849
world, from similar “New Waves” in Brazil,
England, and Spain, to post-War Japanese Cinema,

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.280
and the rise of post-colonial Third Cinema
movements in Africa and South America.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.660
In a couple episodes, we’ll spend some time
examining world cinema in more detail.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.180
Meanwhile, in the United States, that 1948
antitrust lawsuit we mentioned last time – United

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.340
States versus Paramount Pictures, Inc. – forced
the major studios to give up their theater chains.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.960
Suddenly, the marketplace was theoretically
open to all kinds of films, not just whatever

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.750
the biggest studios wanted to show in theaters.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.870
The Hollywood studios were stubborn, though,
and didn’t want to give up their money and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.680
control to the tidal wave of brash, young
filmmakers that was sweeping the rest of the world.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.440
But as the 1950s rolled into the 1960s, the
studios found themselves in real trouble.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.660
Boy howdy!

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.540
After losing their theater chains, they began
facing stiff competition from television.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.410
As 1970 approached, the Baby Boom generation
was coming of age, the war in Vietnam was

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.849
in full swing, American politics was at its
most violent since the Civil War, and studio

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.580
films seemed increasingly out of touch.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.280
Ticket sales were falling, and studio executives
were in an outright panic.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.460
Studio Executives like money, you guys.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.760
So in the late 1960s, a set of films seized

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.420
the opportunity to challenge the studio system
from both inside and outside.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.460
Two New York based magazine writers; David Newman and Robert Benton

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.520
wrote a script called "Bonnie and Clyde" about a pair of charismatic depression era bank robbers

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.480
on a crime spree.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.120
Their goal was to create an American film

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.420
in the style of the French New Wave, and in
fact they almost got François Truffaut

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.430
to direct it.

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.750
Arthur Penn directed the film instead, starring
Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, and after

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.620
winning over some influential critics, it
became a sensation.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.970
With its unapologetic sexuality, casual humor,
and surprisingly brutal violence, Bonnie and

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.570
Clyde was a watershed moment in the history
of American film.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.280
It was made by Warner Brothers, but the film’s
success led to a cascade of independent films

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.530
– films made outside the major studio
system.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.500
In 1969 Dennis Hopper partnered with Peter
Fonda to make a motorcycle road movie set

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.319
to a contemporary rock-and-roll soundtrack.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.790
Produced on a shoestring budget, Easy Rider
became a massive financial and cultural success.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.940
In many ways, these two films – along with
movies like The Graduate in 1967 and Midnight

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.280
Cowboy in 1969 – ushered in an era of surprisingly
personal, idiosyncratic American filmmaking…

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.060
and proved that unique, original films could
also make money.

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.240
And so could Dustin Hoffman.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.080
At the same time, the older generation of
studio executives began to retire.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.120
They probably were okay though. They probably retired on a beach somewhere very nice.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.400
In their place came a new crop of Hollywood
decision makers who were shaped by the same

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:31.960
societal forces as the younger filmmakers
– like the rise of the counterculture, and

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.310
Watergate-era politics.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.470
Suddenly, filmmakers with original visions
who wanted to tell risky stories could get

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.780
financed by major Hollywood studios.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.280
And that's the way it stayed until this day. NOPE!

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.020
Directors like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford
Coppola, Brian de Palma, and Robert Altman

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:48.580
were supported by big studios, and made
films that reached an audience hungry for

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.409
something new and fresh on screen.

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:54.389
This window of creative control and experimentation
came to be called New Hollywood Cinema and

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:56.979
lasted from about 1967 to 1980.

00:07:56.979 --> 00:07:58.960
And it came to an end for a few major reasons.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.410
Many of these New Hollywood filmmakers began
working with larger and larger budgets, which

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:04.780
put more pressure on them to succeed at the
box office.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.419
For every Apocalypse Now – a film that seemed
like a disaster that turned out to be a success

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:11.610
– there was a Heaven’s Gate – a film
that appeared to be a sure bet that flopped

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.110
so hard it ruined a studio.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:16.979
And at the same time, filmmakers like Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas were creating movies

00:08:16.979 --> 00:08:20.470
like Jaws, Star Wars, and Raiders of the Lost
Ark. Heard of 'em?

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.580
Instead of overtly wrestling with the socio-political
upheaval of the ‘60s and ‘70s, these films

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.880
offered a chance to escape, a more pure form of entertainment that appealed to a wider audience.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.500
These were the first summer blockbusters,
and their unexpected success signaled a swing

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.230
away from the more risky, personal films of
the previous decade.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.820
Plus, as all this was happening, the studios
were being purchased by large, multinational

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.700
corporations, which changed the way the studios
worked.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.400
...no multi-national corporation ever purchases me.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:48.240
Gone were the days when a cigar-chomping studio
boss decided which films got made based on

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:49.250
his gut instinct.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.901
Instead, there were stockholders to satisfy,
marketing departments to consult, and risk

00:08:52.901 --> 00:08:54.100
assessments to consider.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.140
Very corporate. Oooo, I love me some risk assessment.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:00.710
Film had always been a mix of art and commerce,
but this period of blockbusters and corporate

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.520
culture forever changed that balance.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.090
The major studios spent much of the 1980s
making big movies that appealed to as many

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:10.550
people as possible – films like E.T., Back
to the Future, Die Hard, and Dirty Dancing.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.600
And, once again, the more unusual American
films had to find other funding.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.040
The 1990s saw the arrival of a new set of
independent filmmakers and mini-studios.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.560
Directors like Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh,
Paul Thomas Anderson, and Quentin Tarantino

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.940
made films for independent companies like
Miramax and New Line Cinema.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.170
It’s not a coincidence that many of these
filmmakers came of age admiring the films

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.170
of the New Hollywood Cinema.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.710
And while they didn’t have the resources
of the major film studios, the success of

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:36.750
films like Do the Right Thing; sex, lies,
and videotape; and Pulp Fiction showed there

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:40.700
was still a hunger for risky, original American
films that continues to today.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:44.420
Today we talked about the rise of post-war
film movements that reacted against the classical

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.850
Hollywood filmmaking style.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.440
We saw the influence of Italian Neo-Realism
and the French New Wave on the New Hollywood

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.300
Cinema filmmakers of the 1970s.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.660
And we discussed the rise of the blockbuster
of the 1980s and the resurgence of independent

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.950
filmmaking in the 1990s.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:10:00.270
Next time, we’ll look at home video and
how streaming services like Netflix and Hulu

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.400
are a major force in recent film history.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.000
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.100
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.390
like PBS Infinite Series, It’s Okay to be
Smart, and Gross Science.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.700
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:19.880
with the help of these risk assessments and our
amazing graphics team, is Thought Cafe.
