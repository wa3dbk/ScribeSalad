Hi. I'm the internet's Craig. This is Crash Course Film History.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.400
Based on what you’ve probably heard, or
read, or… what I told you last time, you’re

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.760
probably under the impression that the development
of modern film technology is all

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.980
thanks to famous inventor Thomas Edison,
and his less-than-famous employee, William Dickson.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.040
You're wrong. I can't believe how wrong you are.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.460
Together, these guys developed two of the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.520
first commercially-viable film technologies:
the kinetograph – basically a camera – and

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.750
the kinetoscope – a single-viewer exhibition
device that you use to watch kinetograph films.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.750
But guess what?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.560
As was often the case with Edison, a lot of
the credit that’s given to him also belongs to a great many other people.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.800
...not me.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.660
While Edison and Dickson were setting out
to make moving pictures in New Jersey, lots

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.880
of other inventors were tinkering with film
technology across the world.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.520
In Lyon, France, a pair of brothers saw the
kinetograph and kinetoscope – and said,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.040
“We can do better than that!”

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.040
And they did.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.090
Within two years, they invented a lightweight,
all-in-one motion picture device that made

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.510
movies and exhibited them.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.540
They figured out a way to use the camera mechanism
to play back the developed roll of film, projecting

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.460
bright light through it to show images.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.360
Films could be projected on an entire wall
or screen, letting audiences of people experience films, together... It'll never work.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.940
By sheer coincidence – or maybe fate – their
surname means “light.”

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.040
Say hello to the Lumière Brothers and the
first projected films.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:23.540
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.820
Auguste and Louis Lumière were born in the 1860s in eastern France.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.760
In 1870, their father moved the family to
Lyon and opened a small factory that made

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.760
photographic plates.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.800
The family business, like all my businesses, teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, until the brothers took over.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.860
They devised machines to help automate the
plant, and invented a new and improved photo plate.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.700
By the time they started experimenting with
film technology, the Lumière Brothers had

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.979
lots of experience in business, engineering,
manufacturing, and photography.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.810
They were intrigued by Edison’s motion picture
devices, but quickly saw the flaws: the camera

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.670
was hard to move, and only one person could
watch a film at a time.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.050
So they went back to the basics, and made
a better camera.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.729
Remember the intermittent stop-and-go mechanism
– how motion picture cameras need to stop

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.480
the film long enough to expose one frame to
light, before moving the roll to the next frame?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.640
Well, the Lumière Brothers developed a device
around the stop-and-go mechanisms used in

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.649
sewing machines.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.040
They weren’t the only ones tinkering with
this engineering problem, though.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.299
Inventors were working independently all over
Europe and the United States, putting the

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.770
pieces together that will one day become cinema.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.209
By 1897, the German optician-turned-film pioneer
Oskar Messter perfected his

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.849
design for the stop-and-go mechanism, called
the Maltese Cross – named after the medal

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:26.849
with the same shape.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.189
It’s also called the Geneva Drive, because
it was first invented in Geneva, Switzerland

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.870
for use in mechanical watches.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.319
Messter’s device has really stood the test
of time: we still use a version of it in most

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.319
projectors today.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.109
But, back to the Lumières and their motion
picture camera. Transition PUNCH!

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.220
Their whole contraption was a compact, portable
box.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.129
It was light enough for one person to carry.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.409
The camera was operated by a hand crank, so
it didn’t rely on an electric power source.

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.510
It used the same 35 millimeter film as Edison’s
kinetograph, but it could also develop the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.400
film that it shot – no more sending film
off to a lab and waiting for the mail.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.940
...I hate waiting for the mail.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.059
But, that's not all, once the film
had been developed, the Lumière device could

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.240
be reconfigured into a projection machine.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.500
So many things in one. It's so... aw it's just good.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.660
They could run the developed film back through
the intermittent stop-and-go mechanism, and,

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:10.900
with a bright light source, the images would
project onto a wall or a screen.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.900
This device could do it all.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.419
You could carry it with you out into the world,
capture footage, develop the film, and then

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.400
project it, any time, anywhere, any way you
wanted.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.340
Don't do it vertical though... commentors hate that.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.360
Compared to the kinetograph and kinetoscope,
it was kind of like the technological leap

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.279
from an old school flip phone to a smartphone.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.260
The Lumière Brothers wanted to call their
invention the “cinématographe,” which means

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.240
“writing with movement.”

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.700
Like Edison, the Lumière Brothers were savvy
businessmen, and secured international patents

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.890
on all their technology.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.169
Doing Edison one better, they saw a lot of
potential in having large, public film screenings.

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.620
Before the public unveiling of their cinématographe,
they held a series of private parties where

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.540
they projected films for groups of distinguished
guests, stoking interest and excitement.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.520
And then in Paris, on December 28th, 1895,
at the Salon Indien in the basement of the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.389
Grand Café, Auguste and Louis Lumière screened
a series of ten short films and changed the

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:58.389
world forever.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:01.859
Now, I should mention that this wasn’t technically
the first public screening of a motion picture.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.369
That honor, as far as we know, goes to Woodville
Latham, an American chemist and kinetoscope

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:09.260
owner, who projected a film of a boxing match
in New York in May, 1895.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.779
What set the Lumière Brothers apart was that
they played up the intrigue of their device

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:16.639
and gained publicity, plus their superior
image quality and the sheer number of films

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:17.639
they presented.

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.180
This is the movie business, after all, and
hype almost always wins.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.120
So the credit for first successful public
screening typically goes to Auguste and Louis Lumière.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.380
Sorry, Latham. Better luck next time. Maybe go back to chemistry.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.940
Among the films the Lumière Brothers screened
that night was “The Train Arrives at La Ciotat Station.”

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.420
In the film, a train – you guessed it – arrives
at a station. Kinda spoiled it with the title.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.900
In a single, uninterrupted shot, it comes
toward the camera, stops, and the passengers disembark.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.180
Legend has it that when the first audience
saw this movie projected on the wall, it was

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.420
so unfamiliar and realistic that they ran
screaming from the theater, fearing for their lives.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.020
In recent years, historians have thrown cold
water on this story for a couple reasons.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.250
First, seeing images projected onto walls
wouldn’t have been a new experience for

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.250
a lot of Parisians.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.930
Some version of the magic lantern projection
device had been used for education and entertainment

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.729
since the 17th century, employing a light
source and a lens to project images or paintings

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.330
from glass plates up onto a wall.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.260
Not to mention, most of the Lumière audience
would probably have been aware of kinetoscope films.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.520
So chances are no one actually thought a
train was about to drive through the wall

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520
and run them all down.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.759
More likely, the audience might have shrieked
in delight at the size and clarity of the

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.340
images projected, and at the sheer magic of
seeing these pictures come to life.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.969
Remember, film presents us with the illusion
of reality.

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.570
And like any good magic trick or optical illusion,
part of the thrill is knowing that what you’re

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.440
seeing isn’t real, but not being able to
tell how the magician pulled it off.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.030
The story of the screaming audience in the
Grand Café also reveals the power film has

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.699
to create a communal experience.

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.599
While the technical wizardry of their cinématographe
was groundbreaking, the unique group psychology

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.650
of movie-going may have been the Lumières’
greatest contribution to film history.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.219
When you’re in an audience watching a film,
you’re having a specific, personal experience,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.720
but you’re also part of a pop-up community.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.920
... and sometimes that community has a has a bunch of kids who won't be quiet and you're trying to watch Batman vs. Superman!

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.611
Think back to the last hysterical comedy you

00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.710
saw in a movie theater, and then tried to
watch again by yourself at home.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.199
It’s not the same, is it?

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.930
Film is this unique artistic medium that can
take on different meanings depending when,

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.669
where, and with whom you’re watching it.

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.479
Now, the Lumière Brothers’ films all shared
a few characteristics.

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:11.600
They were silent, black-and-white, and uninterrupted
shots that lasted less than a minute – much

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.550
like the films out of Edison’s Black Maria.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.879
But rather than capturing stage performers
and skits, the Lumière films were mini-documentaries,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:18.879
known as “actualités.”

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:22.949
They focused on slices of everyday life: two
babies fighting over lunch, a group of workers

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.780
leaving a factory at the end of the day, and,
of course, trains arriving at stations.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.110
These films were financially successful right
out of the gate.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.319
The Lumière Brothers’ first screening brought
in 35 francs, at 1 franc per person.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.260
And within a month, they were making 7,000
francs per week.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.480
that's... *counting* 7,000 people!

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.520
Meanwhile, other inventors were making cinématographe-like devices with cool names like the Bioskop

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.780
and the Theatrograph.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.850
Some were directly inspired by the Lumière
Brothers, while others were independent.

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.159
Thomas Edison saw the financial success the
Lumière Brothers were having and wanted a

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.720
very big piece of that action – abandoning
the kinetoscope to jump into theatrical projection.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.560
Edison and other inventors also began experimenting
with longer films. BORING!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.580
But there was a big problem: these longer
film strips kept tearing inside the projector.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.669
Enter Woodville Latham.

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:05.669
Remember him?

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:07.639
The guy who really held the first public
projection of a movie?

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.129
He held the patent for the Latham Loop, a
different way to feed film into a projector,

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:15.050
which involved a pair of small, loose loops
of film – one above and one below the projector’s

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.199
lens – held in place with extra sprockets.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.599
This helped protect the film from vibrations
and tension, which could lead to damage.

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:25.620
In 1895, another pair of early film pioneers,
C. Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat, used

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.849
the Latham Loop in a projector of their own
design and called it the Vitascope.

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.689
Edison saw this device, bought it outright,
and released it as the “Edison Vitascope,”

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:36.449
giving the original inventors almost no credit…
‘cause that’s how Thomas Edison rolled.

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:39.750
Throughout all this experimentation, most
people thought of films as a fad that would

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.240
burn brightly for a few years, and then disappear
– like arsenic as medicine, séances, or

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.360
Victorian “tear catchers.”

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.860
Even the Lumière Brothers got out of the
movie business in 1905, because they didn’t

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.059
see a future for film. Good idea!

00:07:51.059 --> 00:07:55.630
And it’s true, 50-second Vaudeville performances
and actualités will only entertain audiences

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:56.630
for so long.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.610
But film was growing into something bigger
– a method of mass communication that was

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:01.639
starting to make itself indispensable.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.870
As time went on, filmmakers would take cinématographes
to far-flung places, capturing movies of the

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.180
Amazon Basin, the pyramids at Giza, and the
ruins of Ancient Rome.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.599
Suddenly, you could walk into a theater in
Peoria, Illinois and see Sherpas climbing

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.520
the Himalayas. ... Without drugs!

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.020
In some ways, these kinds of films knit the
world closer together, showing people sights

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:19.469
they’d never experience in real life.

00:08:19.469 --> 00:08:21.900
You can even compare film history to the early
days of YouTube.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.460
Sure, we started with Jawed at the zoo, and
cat videos, and kids on dental anesthesia.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.860
But that was just scratching the surface of
a medium that has let us create so many weird,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.100
wonderful, and important things, and has changed
the way we see ourselves and the world around us.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.760
Today, we introduced you to the Lumière Brothers
and their cinématographe, the all-in-one

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.830
camera, film developing lab, and projector.

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.779
We learned about the first big public film
screenings, and how people were beginning

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:46.600
to have collective movie-going experiences,
as well as very personal ones.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.580
We discussed actualités, the snapshots of
everyday life, and how some filmmakers were

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.860
beginning to push the envelope, exploring
the world and making longer movies.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.399
And next time, we’ll talk about the very
first films to tell stories, using editing

00:08:57.399 --> 00:09:00.500
and special effects to manipulate reality
