00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.240
The earliest days of film are full of self-taught
artists, doing lots of experimentation, and

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.950
stumbling across many a happy accident. And some sad accidents, probably.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.080
Nobody really knew what they were doing.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.910
They were making it up as they went, and audiences
went along for the ride.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.230
At first, people was impressed by the sheer
technical marvel of moving pictures.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.740
But thanks to Georges Méliès’ passion
for to dazzling illusions and tricky editing,

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.900
film began to emerge as a new medium for stories.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.510
As filmmakers started to experiment with narrative
film, they began to establish a language through

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.529
different editing techniques and camera movements.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.570
And with any language comes rules – things
like grammar, syntax, and punctuation – which

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.540
can help artists and storytellers communicate
their ideas in clear and interesting ways.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.820
But before rules can be followed, or broken,
or mastered, they have to be discovered by someone.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.400
And for film, that someone was Edwin S. Porter. And for Eagle Punching, that's me.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:59.060
[Opening Titles Play]

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.260
Georges Méliès was a stage magician whose whole approach to entertainment

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.400
was to wow an audience with illusion, extravagance, and surprise.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.140
So it makes sense that his films, as impressive
and influential as they were, operated as

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.390
performative spectacles.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.270
This type of filmmaking is more interested
in presentation than representation.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.130
We’re supposed to sit back in slack-jawed
amazement at the mysterious feats occurring

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.910
before us, instead of empathizing with characters
or “finding ourselves” on screen.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.250
The film scholar Tim Gunning calls this the
“Cinema of Attractions,” and offers it

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.970
as a way to think about the entire first decade
of film – where the novelty itself of film

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.670
is enough to keep people buying tickets.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.800
You’ve probably experienced this concept
at some point: a new technology comes out,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.640
and at first we’re all just marveling at
what it can do.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.830
Like, posting shaky vertical videos of your
cat online for everybody to see.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.020
Or wandering around outside throwing virtual
Pokéballs at virtual Pokémon. Speaking of... GOT 'EM!

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.220
But eventually, the newness wears off, and
people want something more.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.220
I havn't played Angry Birds in many months.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.040
That’s what was happening in 1903, as mainstream

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.490
films started to focus more on narratives
designed to engage the viewer, rather than

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.670
simply astonish them.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.830
And that’s exactly when Edwin S. Porter
entered the filmmaking scene.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.271
Born in 1870, Porter worked as a sign painter,
telegraph operator, and minor inventor, before

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:04.780
becoming a touring projectionist.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.670
He travelled from South America to Canada
exhibiting films for a device called the Projectorscope

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.110
– one of Edison’s competitors.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.970
Part of Porter’s job was to assemble the
various actualités and short films into longer

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.970
feature programs.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.660
He picked the order, created transitions between
the films, and arranged for any musical or

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.660
spoken accompaniment.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.570
Now, this feels like a good place to make
a point about silent films.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.320
Because there was no such thing!

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.420
WHAT!?!?!

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.200
I mean, even in the Golden Age of Silent Film,
movies were almost never shown in actual silence.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.160
We call them “silent films” because the
technology to record synchronous sound hadn’t

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.170
really been invented yet.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.480
But that doesn’t mean that folks gathered
in theaters, church basements, or barns and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.280
watched films in pin-drop silence.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.560
Larger venues employed full orchestras, bands,
or organists to accompany their films.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.220
Smaller spaces might have had a piano player
or a phonograph.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.000
Or a guy who went, "la la laaaa"... probably not that though.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.860
Some films were even released with scripts
to be performed by actors, or voice-over narration

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.220
to be read along with the images.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.950
So in 1899, after his stint as a travelling
exhibitor of not-so-silent films, Porter returned

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.950
to New York.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.569
He eventually became the head of production
at one of Edison’s film studios, responsible

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.460
for setting the stories, operating the camera,
directing the actors, and assembling the final films.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.440
Wore a lot of hats, that guy.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.540
This is where his time as a touring projectionist
came in handy.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.980
Not only did he have a good idea what kinds
of stories and techniques played well in front

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.680
of an audience, but he’d also spent a lot
of time cutting together different pieces of film.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.440
In doing this rough kind of “editing,”
he stumbled upon a bunch of techniques and

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.450
effects he would put to use in his own multi-shot
films.The most influential of these is called

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.310
parallel action or cross-cutting.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.840
It’s an editing technique so powerful, and
which occurs in so many films and TV shows

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.959
today, that you probably don’t even
think about it.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.240
Basically, parallel action is the idea that
a film can cut back and forth between two

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.440
or more events that are happening simultaneously
within the world of a film.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.540
Even though you’re seeing these scenes in
sequential order, your brain understands that

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.990
they’re actually happening at the same time.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.700
Like, imagine two parallel lines.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.840
Each one represents the timeline of an event,
and both events are occurring at the exact same time.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.840
Now, imagine slicing those two lines up, and
stitching a few alternating pieces together

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.319
into a single new line.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.530
If I were to show you that final assembly
of film, your brain would intuitively understand

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.740
that these events were happening at the same
time.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.740
Cool, right?

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.680
The first film that we know utilized parallel
action successfully was Edwin S. Porter’s

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.680
Life of an American Fireman, made in 1902
and inspired by Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.300
The story follows – spoiler alert – an
American fireman, who rescues his wife from

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.310
a burning building.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.940
The film begins with a napping fireman dreaming
about his wife and child going to bed at home.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.340
I love napping.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.740
After a fire alarm is pulled, and the firemen
race to the house on fire, we cut inside the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.669
building to see the wife and child carried
out of their smoke-filled bedroom.

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.990
Then, the film cuts back outside the building,
and we watch the same firemen enter the same

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.919
building and emerge once again with the wife
and the child.

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.260
Even though this innovation seems small, it
contributed to film grammar in ways we still

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.840
see to this day, and affected what filmmakers
thought was possible as they constructed their

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.930
stories for the screen.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.590
Now, in 1903, Porter released his most successful
film: The Great Train Robbery.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.870
Some scholars argue that The Great Train Robbery
doesn’t use parallel action in the same

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.920
way that The Life of an American Fireman did.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.812
But I think a close reading of the film shows
a sophisticated understanding of how a filmmaker

00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:58.420
can manipulate time by cutting between simultaneous
scenes.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.870
In the film, a railroad engineer is knocked
out and tied up by a group of bandits bent

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:03.990
on hijacking a train.

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.880
The heist plays out in a traditional, linear
fashion: Each scene is one uninterrupted shot

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.380
after another, including a really long shot
of the thieves lining up the passengers and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:12.380
stealing their stuff.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.560
Then, a remarkable thing happens... and I'm gonna remark on it.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.250
Once the heist is complete, the film cuts
back to the railroad office, as a young girl

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.470
discovers the unconscious engineer, revives
him, and sets him free.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.130
We then cut to a group of law enforcement
officers at a dance, where the engineer busts

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.590
in and alerts them to the heist.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.690
And finally, we cut to the criminals riding
horses through the woods, being chased by

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.030
the law enforcement officers.

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.949
At this moment, the two time streams that
were happening simultaneously – the railroad

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:38.010
engineer’s and the criminals’ – suddenly
merge.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.720
And the rest of the film plays out in another
linear scene in which the offers gun down

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.740
the criminals, dispensing the kind of frontier
justice that would make Clint Eastwood proud.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.820
Contemporary films use cross-cutting all the
time.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.740
Take the final sequence from The Godfather,
for example.

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.240
70s but, contemporary.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.000
In it, director Francis Ford Coppola cuts

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.760
back and forth between the baptism of Michael
Corleone’s godson and the slaughter of his

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.210
enemies – church to bloodbath and back again. Fun.

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.560
This kind of parallel action not only shows
us events that are happening simultaneously,

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.729
but also connects them thematically and symbolically.

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.370
Michael is consolidating his power as head
of a major crime family through both violent

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.730
and peaceful means, in ceremonies both sacred
and profane, juxtaposing life and death.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.449
Not every use of parallel action is as profound
as that, though.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.110
Comic book blockbusters like The Dark Knight
or Captain America: The Winter Soldier cross-cut

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.830
during action sequences to heighten tension,
while thrillers like The Fugitive and The

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.560
Silence of the Lambs juxtapose the pursuer
and the pursued.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.010
And every romantic comedy that ends with a
race to the airport cuts back and forth between

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:34.980
the would-be sweethearts, daring us to consider
the possibility that they won’t live happily

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.980
ever after.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.270
All of that starts with Edwin S. Porter and
his experiments with parallel action.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.680
Porter was responsible for a few other innovations
in The Great Train Robbery that made it one

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.190
of the most influential movies of the early
silent era.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.050
Before The Great Train Robbery, most films
consisted of static shots.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.760
The camera was set up, someone turned the
crank, and the scene played out before the lens.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.759
Porter was among the first filmmakers to begin
moving the camera during the shot.

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:56.400
And that’s how we got the pan and the tilt.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.889
A pan occurs when the camera is turned left
or right on a horizontal axis from a fixed

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:01.500
point, like the top of a tripod.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.600
And a tilt happens when the camera is moved
up or down on a vertical axis from a fixed point.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.419
Porter used both in The Great Train Robbery,
including one remarkable pan as the escaping

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.820
criminals hop over a stream and scurry through
the trees.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.790
The camera pans left with them to discover…
horses: their means of escape!

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:18.290
The film and the filmmaker are playing a trick
on us.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.580
They know more than we do, and Porter is revealing
narrative information in a camera move, instead

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.760
of just showing us everything!

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.680
He’s using the camera to tell the story. Amazing!

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.740
Here’s another chance to put yourself in
the shoes of an audience member: one who’s

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.210
only seen films where the camera never moved,
and all the story information was right there

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:34.210
in the shot.

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.170
Then imagine seeing a film where that information
was withheld and given to you piece by piece,

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.170
keeping you on your toes.

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.180
You’re suddenly watching an exponentially
more sophisticated film.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.180
Lucky you.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.900
Not to mention, the last shot of The Great
Train Robbery was unique in its own right.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.420
It’s a medium close-up of one of the bandits,
much closer than any shot we’ve seen so

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.600
far – from about navel up – and he’s
looking directly at us.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.350
He raises his pistol, aims at the camera – at
us! – and fires.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.220
The size, scale, and direct gaze of this shot
was startling at the time, and influential

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.360
enough that Martin Scorsese stole it for a
key moment in Goodfellas.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.760
And if it’s good enough for Marty, it must
be pretty good. Marty, if you're watching? Can I call you Marty?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:07.600
Let me know in the comments.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.220
No single filmmaker did as much to shape narrative
film grammar in the first decade of motion

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:12.889
pictures as Edwin S. Porter.

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:16.520
He uncovered a series of tools and techniques
– the first rules of narrative film language

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.310
– that subsequent directors would use, modify,
and expand upon for decades to come.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.430
Prior to The Life of an American Fireman and
The Great Train Robbery, films were almost

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:28.820
all constructed in a strictly linear fashion
– complete scene followed by complete scene. BORING!

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.490
But after Porter, filmmakers became more adept
at telling stories, using shots and cuts to

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.769
engage the audience and keep them coming back
for more.

00:08:34.769 --> 00:08:37.019
And in many ways, film has never looked back.

00:08:37.019 --> 00:08:40.409
Today we learned about Edwin S. Porter, whose
experiments with editing helped establish

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.420
the language of narrative film, and expanded
the horizons of what filmmakers thought was possible.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.820
We introduced the idea of cross-cutting, and
how our brains can understand when a film

00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:49.730
cuts between simultaneous events.

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.819
