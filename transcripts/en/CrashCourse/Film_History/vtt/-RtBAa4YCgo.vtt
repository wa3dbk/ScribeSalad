00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.509
The Russian Revolution marked the first major
civil war fought in the age of cinema.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.230
And the big winners in that struggle understood
the unique ability of film to change minds

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.230
and inflame hearts.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.530
Today, we’ll meet a bunch of filmmakers
who spent as much time studying films as

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.530
they did making them.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.830
We’ll see the founding of the world’s
first film school.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.710
And we’ll watch the rise of a cohesive,
self-conscious, and game-changing film movement

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.609
that would unlock the power of the cut to
create meaning, shape public opinion, and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.920
call a hungry populace to action.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.240
It’s time to cut...
to Soviet Montage.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:45.460
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.940
In 1917, the second of two violent revolts

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.220
in Russia, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew
the Tsar and brought the Bolsheviks to power.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.200
“Bolshevik” means “majority” in Russian,
by the way, and this political movement grew

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.170
from the peasant and working classes who acquired
their power through persuasion and force.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.170
That’s important.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.170
You should remember that.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.950
Because the resulting government, ruled by
what would become the Communist Party, was

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.380
organized around principles of workers’
rights, state control of industry, and the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.380
suppression of dissent.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.710
So the government took a strong interest in
film, because it recognized cinema for what

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.359
it was – a powerful tool for social and
political influence.

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.729
But before it could get that engine started,
the party had a few obstacles to overcome.

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.430
First, it needed to centralize the Russian
film industry.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.080
Prior to the revolution, there were a lot
of production companies, mostly making pro-Tsarist films.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.800
In 1918, the new Bolshevik government did
what Germany had done in creating UFA – which

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.850
we talked about last time.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.740
They took over the studios, combining them
to form one state-owned company called Narkompros,

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.170
also known as The People’s Commissariat
for Education.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.240
Second, and more importantly, there was virtually
no raw film stock in the country.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.980
You're gonna need film stock if you're gonna make films.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.580
The revolutionary government choked off imports,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.810
and Russia didn’t have the capacity to manufacture
much of its own stock.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.689
So, some enterprising Russian filmmakers took
a different approach.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.600
They started studying films.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.640
What?!?! That’s what you’re doing right now!

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.049
And they didn’t just watch them; they dissected them.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.049
Literally.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.670
They took the actual reels of film, cut them
apart, and analyzed them.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.670
How long were the shots?

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.670
What was the camera angle?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.480
How was the image composed?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.529
How did they do the thing?

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.280
And most importantly, how were the shots edited
together?

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:06.759
In what order, and why?

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.540
Then they began experimenting – rearranging
the order of the shots, shortening some, repeating

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.620
others – all to see what the effects might
be.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.160
To encourage this experimentation, the government
founded the world’s first film school in 1919.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.720
It was called VGIK, or the State Institute
of Cinematography.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.920
The most well-known and influential teacher
at this new school was the filmmaker Lev Kuleshov.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.239
And his most famous discovery bears his name
and provided his students with the cornerstone

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.890
of a new cinematic philosophy.

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.860
What he discovered is now known as the Kuleshov
Effect, and it came to light like this:

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.010
Kuleshov took a shot of a well-known Russian
matinee idol named Ivan Mosjoukine

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.129
staring off-camera with no expression.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.200
He then cut to an image of a bowl of soup,
and then back to the shot of Ivan.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.079
When he asked viewers what Ivan was feeling,
they said he was hungry.

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.570
Kuleshov then took the same footage of Ivan,
but this time intercut it with a shot of a

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.570
girl in a coffin.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.680
Now, the audience said Ivan felt sad.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.950
Finally, Kuleshov projected the shot of Ivan,
then cut to a woman on a couch.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.660
The viewers said he was feeling desire.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.730
The Kuleshov Effect suggests that viewers
draw more meaning from two shots cut together,

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.810
than either shot on its own.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.719
And the Soviet filmmakers believed that
phenomenon was the true power of cinema, something

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.700
no other art form can do: juxtapose two images
in real time to create a new, and sometimes

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.700
unrelated, meaning.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.409
It’s also one more example of film as an
illusion of reality.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.700
Kuleshov took Georges Méliès one step further:
not only can a cut be used to hide a magic

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.540
trick, it is a magic trick!

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.700
And that wasn’t Kuleshov’s only contribution.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.700
Or his only illusion.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.700
He also developed a concept called Creative
Geography, also known as Artificial Landscape.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.209
This effect can be created when two segments
of film shot in entirely different locations

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.180
are cut together to make them appear to be
happening in a continuous space.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.430
If you’ve watched Doctor Who, this is how
they make it seem like the TARDIS is bigger

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.520
on the inside.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.080
Just kidding. It actually is!

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.740
We call the overarching theory of film developed

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.549
by Kuleshov and his students Soviet Montage.

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.420
Montage comes from the French word, meaning
“assembling” or “editing” or... "montage."

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.189
And the theory of montage proposes that films
derive their ultimate power and meaning through

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.170
the way the shots are cut together – their
order, duration, repetition, and rhythm.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.189
Beyond that, Soviet Montage filmmakers believed
that for film to reach its true potential,

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.020
the cuts themselves should be visible.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.340
The audience should be aware of them.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.900
That the illusion should be obviously constructed, and not hidden.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.959
We call this style of editing discontinuity
editing, and it fit quite neatly into another

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.480
political idea the Soviet Montage filmmakers
had: that the artist was an engineer, simply

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.459
another worker, joining shots the way a brick-layer
builds a wall or a factory worker assembles

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:22.459
a vehicle.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.000
For these folks, the process of filmmaking
was as much a political statement

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.460
as the movie itself.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.789
Within Soviet Montage, there are a lot of
ways to juxtapose images.

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.419
There’s Intellectual Montage, for example,
which refers to the juxtaposition of two otherwise

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.370
unrelated images to create a third idea in
your mind.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.660
This is the purest form of Soviet Montage,
and Kuleshov’s experiment is a perfect example.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.710
Ivan’s face juxtaposed against soup equals
hunger.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.000
Tonal Montage puts together two or more shots
that have similar tonal or thematic qualities.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.610
The idea here is that these shots build on
one another and reinforce the emotional or

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.870
psychological meaning the film is trying to
convey..

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.470
Two rams butting heads next to a fist next
to people rioting and you’ve got images

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.970
that may make you think of conflict.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.479
But, a flower opening next to a baby yawning
next to a sunrise might be beginnings.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:07.410
To take a great – and decidedly non-Soviet
example – think about Dumbledore’s death

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.690
scene in Harry Potter.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.199
The shots between Snape and Dumbledore are
drawn out, still, each wrestling with his

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.130
emotions, followed by Dumbledore’s slow-motion
fall.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.950
Metric Montage dictates that shots are cut
after a specified number of frames, regardless

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.430
of what’s happening in the shot.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.190
This can be quite jarring, as on-screen actions
are interrupted, but the rhythm of the editing

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.400
itself has a psychological effect.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.060
The speeding up or slowing down of edits can
greatly affect the amount of tension the audience

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.060
is feeling.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.190
There are moments in the famous shower scene
from Psycho where Hitchcock uses this technique,

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.000
cutting between the knife and the victim without
regard for continuity, tone, or musical rhythm.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.880
And, any modern action movie tends to pick
up the pace of the editing as the fight scenes

00:05:58.889 --> 00:05:59.889
pick up intensity.

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.700
Rhythmic Montage, on the other hand, matches
the cuts to music, sound effects, or action on screen.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.680
Marching feet or beating drums.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.360
Modern movie trailers do this all the time,
using music to link various shots from a movie.

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.640
And finally, overtonal Montage is the combination of metric, rhythmic, and tonal montage.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.220
One of the best examples of Overtonal Montage

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.140
comes from the final stand off in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.600
we see Tonal Montage in the Mise en Scene. Desert, cracked Earth, tired and weathered faces,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.840
a cemetery, this is the end, death is coming.

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.860
[Craig sings theme from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly]

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.300
Rhythmic Montage is pretty obviously used as the scene is punctuated

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.920
with cuts of the 3 gunslingers based on the rhythm of Ennio Morricone's incredible score.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500
Finally, Metric Montage.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.300
We begin the sequence is long cuts

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.600
but as the intensity picks up, we cut faster and faster and faster UNTIL!

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.300
Now, imagine you’re a Soviet Montage filmmaker,
and you’ve spent months or years studying

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.039
films and developing your theories.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:32.760
What happens when you finally get your hands
on some fresh film stock in the early 1920s?

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760
That’s right.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.540
You start making films with a vengeance.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.060
Not, like, films with "a vengeance" in the title, like Die Hard with A Vengence

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.640
but like, you make films with the attitude of vengeance.

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.400
One of the most influential Soviet Montage
filmmakers was a former engineering student

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.780
named Sergei Eisenstein.

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:51.250
It was Eisenstein’s second feature film,
Battleship Potemkin, that launched him to

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.949
international fame and provided a blueprint
for how filmmakers could incorporate Soviet

00:07:54.949 --> 00:07:59.080
Montage theories – particularly intellectual
montage – into fiction films.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.830
Made in 1925, Battleship Potemkin tells the
true story of a mutiny aboard a Russian battleship

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:04.990
in 1905.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.580
Rather than focus on a single protagonist,
the film dramatizes the miserable conditions

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.129
of the sailors as they toil under officers
who beat them and deprive them of food.

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:15.889
In the film’s most famous section, the Odessa
Steps Sequence, the sailors are cheered on

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.379
by the people of Odessa… until Tsarist troops
show up and slaughter the crowd.

00:08:19.379 --> 00:08:23.139
The shots themselves are fairly horrifying
– bullet wounds, trampled children, anguished

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:26.540
parents, a baby carriage rolling perilously
through the middle of the battle.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.080
But Eisenstein’s real innovation lies in
the use of montage to bring life to the chaos,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.860
madness, and violence of the action.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.760
Eisenstein wanted the juxtaposition of sometimes-unrelated
images to jolt the audience out of their complacency.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.669
The film is also a powerful piece of propaganda,
which we’ll define as a biased or misleading

00:08:41.669 --> 00:08:44.099
communication designed to promote a particular
point of view.

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:46.750
And just because something’s propaganda
doesn’t mean that it’s false.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:49.520
The Tsarists really did put down a revolt
in Odessa in 1905!

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.320
But by making the sailors and civilians so
innocent and the officers and Tsarist troops

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.130
so cruel, the film comes down on one side
and stokes the viewer’s outrage against

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:58.130
the other.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.529
We’ve seen this before – in the egregious
re-writing of American history in Birth of

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:04.660
a Nation – and we see it today – in everything
from political ads to issue documentaries.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.160
Film was and remains one of the most powerful
tools of persuasion in the world.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.880
Another Soviet filmmaker who excelled at persuasion,
but took a different approach to montage,

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.740
was the documentarian Dziga Vertov.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:18.130
Vertov began his career as an editor in 1918,
before becoming a cameraman and travelling

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.740
around the country taking newsreel footage.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.390
Vertov was an opinionated and rigorous thinker,
and he banded together with other like-minded

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.850
documentarians to propose their own ideas
about film.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:28.290
They called themselves “Kinoki” or “Cinema-Eye”
and

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.350
wrote manifestos dissing fiction films.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.970
They believed that only documentaries could
be true and honest.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.500
Vertov’s goal was to use the camera to record
quote-unquote “reality,” and then arrange

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.089
his shots using montage to create pure meaning,
rather than tell a story.

00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:43.350
His masterwork is The Man with the Movie Camera,
made in 1929.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.870
It follows a day in the life of a city, from
empty streets and sleeping figures through

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.550
work and meals and evening traffic.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.980
Actually, the film is as much about the process
of making the film as it is about anything else.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.980
We see the cameraman shooting the footage.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:57.980
We see the editor, Yelizaveta Svilova, who
was also Vertov’s wife, choosing shots and

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:01.300
cutting them together into sequences that
we then see unfold on screen.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.350
Vertov uses special effects, freeze frames,
special camera rigs, animation, compositing,

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:08.029
even non-linear editing – all the tools
cinema had at the time.

00:10:08.029 --> 00:10:11.550
He painted a portrait of his city, its people,
and the artist as an engineer, pulling back

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.980
the curtain to reveal the truth of how the
film was made.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.630
But of course, as we’ve talked about, film
is ultimately an illusion of reality, not

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:18.750
reality itself.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:22.070
Film scholars have long recognized that however
useful Vertov’s theories were in making

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.560
films, they don’t account for the fact that
all moving photographs are by nature constructed realities.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.600
Whether they’re in service of a fictional
story or a documentary, they’re chosen and

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.580
cut together to articulate a point of view.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.890
Just as there’s very little “reality”
in reality TV, so Vertov’s documentaries

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:37.060
are simply a different use of the magic trick
of film.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:41.640
As power shifted to Stalin, western films
began to pour back into the U.S.S.R., and

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.330
film stock became more readily available.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:46.760
And the government cooled on the esoteric
Soviet Montage filmmakers.

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.480
Audiences wanted something more accessible,
more emotional.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.010
Socialist Realism, which began as a movement
in literature, became the state-supported

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.269
style of cinema.

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:57.230
Filmmakers were told to focus on realistic
stories that supported communist values.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.550
A sort of propaganda-through-relatability,
rather than abstract theory.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.790
A prime example of this is the 1935 film Youth
of Maxim.

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:07.680
The story follows a naive, young factory worker
in pre-Revolutionary Russia who helps his

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.230
colleagues hide a subversive teacher from
the police.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.240
Over the course of the film, the young man
is radicalized and eventually joins the Revolution.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:18.370
Rather than use jarring cuts and juxtaposition,
the film relies on a much more smooth, mainstream

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:21.811
style, encouraging viewers to identify with
the character and buy into the reality of

00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:22.811
the story.

00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:24.519
That brought an end to the Soviet Montage
movement.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:27.890
As often happens, however, the techniques
developed by the Soviet Montage filmmakers

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.700
continue to influence cinema to this day,
in everything from the shower scene in Psycho,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.200
to the latest music video.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.370
And movie trailers… pretty much all the
movie trailers.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.000
Today we learned how the Russian Revolution
led to a subsequent revolution in cinema.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.850
We talked about how the Soviet Montage filmmakers
believed editing was the most foundational

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.170
element of film technique.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:48.110
We looked at some of the filmmakers who put
those theories into practice, and how their

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.260
films worked as state-sponsored propaganda.

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.019
Next time, we’ll cross back to Hollywood
to witness the Golden Silent Era and the rise

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:57.760
of the studio system – where movies were
made as art, entertainment, and commerce,

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:01.040
more often than political statements – as
the story of film continues.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.839
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.460
