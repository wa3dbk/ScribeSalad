00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.880
Quick question…

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.440
what is stuff?

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.510
Maybe that’s too big.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.230
Fine, how about this one…

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.230
Where are we?

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.180
Like, all of us, Earth, the solar system,
the galaxy… where the heck are we?

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.039
These questions are kind of a starting point
for the scientific method and have been asked

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400
by thinkers for a long time.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.380
They’re questions that not only make us
try to find answers, but make us think about

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.070
How we find answers.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.010
I’m Hank Green and for most of my life I’ve
been obsessed with questions, answers, why

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.990
we ask questions, and how we get those answers.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.440
To that end, ever since we started making
Crash Course I’ve wanted to make a series

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.070
about the History of Science.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.920
AND NOW I GET TO DO IT!

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.359
If we look at that first question I asked,
“what is stuff”: while physicists will

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:50.300
say that stuff is made of atoms, and atoms
are made of quarks and leptons, we still don’t

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.079
know, like... why quarks exist.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.170
Or why there appears to be far more matter
in the universe than we can account for.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.170
Which is… weird!

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.649
And we don’t have the answers yet.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.960
But, we use a method to get at the answers.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.730
A method that we’ve been developing for
many centuries.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.080
The Scientific Method.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.260
This series is going to be our chance to explore
that method’s development through the ages.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.790
From people like Aristotle and Plato and their
schools/cults, to the Mauryan empire and how

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.220
they tied science and religion to practical
things like irrigation.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.050
The pre-industrial world is full of science
and people trying to answer big questions.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.170
Both because they were fascinated and because
they wanted to… not die.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.170
But we won’t stop there.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.300
Modern history is full of us expanding our
knowledge and coming up with new answers to

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.780
age old questions.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.940
Making planes fly, the discovery of DNA, the
space race, and yes… unfortunately a few

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.250
bombs, have all opened new doors to our understanding
of what stuff is and where we are.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.140
So please, join me this year as we look at
the storied, messy, and amazing history of

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.610
humans figuring stuff out, here on Crash Course
History of Science.
