00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.309
The religion of Islam significantly influenced
knowledge-making in the greater Mediterranean

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.179
and western Asian world.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.110
Islamicate scholars—meaning people influenced
by Islamic civilization, regardless of their

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.930
religious views—gave us terms such as “algebra,”
“azimuth,” “algorithm,” “alcohol,”

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.050
“alkali,” and “alembic.”

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.539
We’ll dive into Islamic medicine and philosophers
such as the great Persian polymath Ibn Sina

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.189
in future episodes.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.940
For now, let’s explore the beginnings of
Islamicate natural philosophy.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:41.940
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.180
Islamicate power expanded rapidly after the
Prophet Muhammad’s death in CE 632.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.199
What began as one vast Arab-governed state
soon fractured into two spheres of political

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.530
influence: a western one centered in southern
Spain, with a capital at Córdoba, and an

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.059
eastern one including the great cities of
northern Africa as well as Arabia and Mesopotamia.

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.670
This eastern empire, the highly urbanized
Abbasid Caliphate,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.500
existed in some form, increasingly fragmented,
from 750–1517.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.400
The Abbasid Caliphate was a crossroads or
trading zone for Persian, Indian, and Byzantine

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.530
cultures, as well as for the religions of
Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.090
Many languages flourished across the Abbasid
Caliphate, as they did in the Emirate of Córdoba.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.910
This blend of cultures and belief systems
made early Islamicate science cosmopolitan—that

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.320
is, generally inclusive in character.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.910
A high literacy rate thanks to Islam’s focus
on the Qur’an meant that many people—well,

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.790
noble men, at least—could study natural
philosophical texts.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.020
Further, Islam-the-religion called on its
adherents to treat others as equals, helping

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.979
make Islamicate knowledge production more
egalitarian.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.610
And ongoing support by pious philanthropists
including heads of states allowed Islamicate

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.440
polymaths to study natural phenomena systematically.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.840
Baghdad, the first Abbasid capital, was founded

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.640
by its second caliph, al-Mansur, in 754.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.640
A sprawling metropolis quickly grew up around
the original, carefully planned city.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.830
And Baghdad became the largest urban area
in the world by 930, with a population of

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.830
one million.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.630
Key for our story today: Baghdad housed the
Bayt al-Ḥikmah or House

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.630
of Wisdom.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.890
This great library grew out of al-Mansur’s
private collection, which he opened up to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.860
visiting scholars, including delegations from
India.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.010
Al-Mansur’s successor, Caliph al-Rashid, carried on this tradition.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.090
Al-Rashid also supported the Translation Movement,
which we’ll get to shortly.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.510
But first, let’s reflect on his rule as
a great example of the cosmopolitan character

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.510
of the early Abbasids.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.310
Charlemagne sent a mission from France to
al-Rashid’s court in 799 with gifts.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.889
So in 802, al-Rashid sent Charlemagne an embassy
including an elephant named Abul-Abbas and

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.590
a water clock that featured clockwork knights
who emerged once per hour.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.310
You could see the elephant’s journey as
one origin of veterinary science: the Abbasid

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.790
diplomats kept the elephant healthy walking
from India to Baghdad to France, and it lived

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.450
for years after in captivity.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.900
And, to the Franks, the water clock was simply
mind-blowing, something they’d never even

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:07.900
imagined!

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.320
But it was al-Rashid’s successor, Caliph
al-Maʾmūn, who in 832 refounded

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.520
the House of Wisdom specifically as an international
center for translation and research.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.380
Al-Maʾmūn was involved in the House’s
daily operations, and he sponsored knowledge

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.630
production programmatically, inspiring his
successors to do the same.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.000
By 850, the House of Wisdom had become the
largest library in the world.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.280
Al-Maʾmūn sponsored families of scholar–translators

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.840
to bring useful texts into Arabic from Greek,
Chinese, Sanskrit, Persian, and Syriac.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:43.729
This should be known as the “Useful Texts
into Arabic Movement” but, for some reason,

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.000
is called the Translation Movement instead.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.360
This movement began with Persian texts concerning
astrology and astronomy.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.199
Remember that, across the ancient and medieval
worlds, astronomy was the study of the heavens,

00:03:55.199 --> 00:04:00.090
and astrology the study of the influence of
heavenly bodies on earthly matters.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.600
While both were studied, astrology was seen
as more useful.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.590
After texts about the stars, the translators
moved onto others.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.040
To feed this program, al-Maʾmūn sent emissaries
to collect Greek scientific manuscripts from

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.120
the Byzantines—and began demanding them
as loot in war.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.940
The Translation Movement lasted from roughly
750–950.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.650
By 950, virtually every Greek scholarly text
had been translated multiple times, and the

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.400
libraries were brimming.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.590
Many translators of Baghdad particularly fell
for the works of Aristotle.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.250
One of the greatest Islamicate philosophers,
Ibn Rushd, is sometimes called

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.570
“The Commentator,” meaning the number-one
Aristotle fan.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.410
To this day, more classical Greek commentaries
on Aristotle may be available in Arabic than

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.410
English!

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.680
Why was Caliph al-Maʾmūn so into the Persian
and Greek science?

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.640
For one, supporting translations was a sign
of civic status, and a worthy cause.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.210
Al-Maʾmūn also saw scientific translation
as highly practical.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.100
For example, a better understanding of astronomy
led to more accurate official timekeeping

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.100
for mosques.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.370
And improved geographical knowledge helped
more accurately align prayers to Mecca.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.840
The Translation Movement also fostered a strong
appreciation for reasoned thought, at least

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.210
among the ruling and scholarly classes.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.000
This rubbed off on religious philosophy, giving
rise to the school of mu‘tazilism.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.810
Mu‘tazila such as al-Maʾmūn believed that
rationalism could be used to understand both

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.570
the physical world and God.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.690
They brought the Greek tradition of reasoned
debate about the nature of the cosmos into

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.380
an Islamicate social context, looking beyond
a literal reading of the Qur’an for sources

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:31.380
of knowledge.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.140
In fact, places of learning under the Abbasid

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.550
Caliphate included observatories, hospitals,
and public libraries, as well as mosques and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.150
madrasas, or Islamic colleges.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.440
Madrasas were critical centers of knowledge
transmission.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.830
There were thirty in Baghdad in the 1200s,
and one hundred and fifty in Damascus by 1500.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.370
Each madrasa had its own library full of paper
books.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.850
Paper had been introduced to western Asia
from China, and paper factories appeared in

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.170
Samarkand, Baghdad, Cairo, Morocco, and finally
in Spain by 1150.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:05.210
While they were religious centers, madrasas
were also places where students could learn

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.010
law as well as Greek natural philosophy, including
logic and arithmetic, astronomy, and astrology.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.460
Abbasid scholars didn’t merely translate

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.620
foreign writers.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.270
In translating the texts, these polymaths
wrote commentaries on them, comparing, summarizing,

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.270
and analyzing them.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.990
Even when motivated by utilitarian concerns,

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.420
the work of careful reading and comparison
led many scholars to pursue new questions

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:29.680
in natural philosophy.

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.230
For example, observatories arose throughout
the Islamicate world.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.030
Al-Maʾmūn built two observatories, one in
Baghdad and another outside Damascus.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.780
At these sites, scholars refined astronomical
handbooks, called zīj, that helped

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.910
fix prayer times.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.420
In fact, by the late ninth century, Islamicate
polymaths such as Abu Maʿshar,

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:51.860
the famous Persian physician al-Razi —whom
we’ll meet again soon—and the Indian-influenced

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.050
al-Biruni were even proposing
heliocentric models of the solar system.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.000
Their theories went against Aristotle but
with observed data!

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.010
In geography, Islamicate scholars extended
Ptolemy’s system.

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.139
Our scientific hero today, Caliph al-Maʾmūn,
commissioned a measurement of earth’s circumference

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:13.169
that was pretty amazing: two groups ventured
into the desert, finding a specific location

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:14.840
by following the stars.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.090
One group walked north and the other south,
tracking the stars for one degree.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.980
They counted their paces.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:26.150
Then they walked back, remeasured, averaged
the measurements… and multiplied by 360

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.740
to derive a circumference of 24,480 miles.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.210
The modern measurement?

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:37.020
24,901—less than 2% more accurate than the
one made by al-Maʾmūn’s team.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.419
And don’t get me started on astrolabes!

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:44.370
You know—mechanical devices used for measuring
incline by astronomers and navigators?

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.400
To determine the position of celestial bodies
in the night sky?

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.700
The ones Islamicate astronomers improved by
adding the azimuth, or direction of compass

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.700
bearing?

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.860
And then merged with armillary spheres, or
models of the entire cosmos constructed from

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.590
rings and hoops that revolved on their axes,
around 900?

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.900
And then improved into geared mechanical astrolabes
in 1235?

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.320
I’m looking at you, Abi Bakr of Isfahan!?

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.900
MEANWHILE—back at the House of Wisdom…

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.890
In addition to translation and improvement
on Greek natural philosophy, scholars were

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:14.800
also innovating in new realms.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:19.400
In mathematics, medieval Islamicate scholars
focused on arithmetic and algebra.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:25.050
They adopted the number zero and the “Arabic”
decimal-style numerals from India, using them

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.190
so much that they became known to us as, well,
Arabic.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.180
They also developed trigonometry.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:34.419
One example of this work in particular jumps
out: in 820, at the House, Muhammad ibn Musa

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:38.080
al-Khwarizmi wrote Kitab al-Jabr,

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.060
or The Compendious Book on Calculation by
Completion and Balancing, an original manual

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.450
of practical math.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.620
Al-Khwarizmi wasn’t the first to work on
algebra, but he set out the general rules

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.820
for solving equations that was highly influential
for centuries.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:58.640
Algebra introduced a theory that treated rational
numbers, irrational numbers, geometrical magnitudes—all

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.760
numbers—as similar objects, ready to be
manipulated.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:06.930
Or, as my dude himself says it: “When I
consider what people generally want in calculating,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.460
I found that it always is a number.”

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.460
Mic drop!

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:16.330
This opened up the possibility of exploring
new areas of mathematics such as algorithms,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.310
quadratic equations, and polynomial equations.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.770
Also at the House of Wisdom, thinkers such
as Mohammad Mūsā worked on the basic laws

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:23.850
of physics.

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.100
Others focused on optics, performing many
experiments.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.180
And doctors and philosophers trained and traded
works.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.779
But what about the engineers—the scholars
working on technē instead of epistēmē?

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:35.390
The Abbasid state privileged public service

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.330
and the interests of the state, focusing on
improving useful arts such as hydraulic engineering

00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:41.890
and agricultural science.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.490
The Abbasids used the arch, rather than the
Greek post and lintel system.

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:50.240
And they constructed large dams, waterwheels,
and qanats, or underground channels

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.730
to tap groundwater.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.140
Abbasid technology thus resembled that of
the Romans, with craftspeople, not scholars,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:57.990
typically building actual stuff.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:03.900
But a few stand-out engineers from this time
period created wonders so—er—wondrous,

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.170
that they deserve a little attention from
ThoughtBubble:

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:08.900
In 850, at the House of Wisdom, the Banū

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:13.370
Mūsā brothers—Mohammad,
just mentioned, and Ahmad and Hasan—wrote

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.450
The Book of Ingenious Devices:

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.430
a compendium of one hundred devices and how
to use them.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:25.380
This included the earliest programmable machine,
“The Instrument that Plays by Itself.”

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.020
Medieval automation, whaaat!?h
And it gets cooler.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:33.350
In 1206—far from Baghdad, in what is now
Diyarbakır, Turkey—the

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.610
polymath al-Jazarī wrote an
even more amazing book on machines: The Book

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:43.130
of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices
also covers one hundred machines, with instructions

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.130
on how to build them.

00:10:44.130 --> 00:10:48.480
Most of these are trick vessels, but others
include water wheels, watermills, a giant

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:54.740
water clock, elephant- and castle-shaped clocks,
fountains improving upon designs by the Banū

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:58.350
Mūsās, a candle clock, and musical automata.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.620
Al-Jazarī even designed a water-powered,
perpetually-playing flute!

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.320
How did these devices work?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.350
Well, it helped that al-Jazarī invented the
camshaft, which would make it into Europe

00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:12.339
by the 1300s, an early version of the crankshaft,
and the segmental gear.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:17.290
You can look up how these work online, but
the point is: our modern world runs on them,

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.410
and this guy figured them out in medieval
times.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:21.410
That is so.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:22.410
Dang.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:23.410
Cool.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:27.710
But the coolest of al-Jazarī’s inventions
were his full-on automata—medieval robots.

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:32.170
He made humanoid machines including one that
could serve water or tea.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:36.839
He made a flushing toilet with a nearby servant,
who refilled the basin when flushed.

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:43.040
And the pièce de résistance: al-Jazarī
constructed a four-piece robot band that floated

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.450
on a lake, entertaining party guests.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.450
The music?

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.080
Most likely programmable, using tiny pegs
and levers.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.700
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:55.750
We could spend several more episodes on science
in the early Islamicate world.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.830
And we will come back to some of the people
and themes mentioned today.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:03.620
There’s a common understanding of the history
of medieval Eurasia and North Africa long-held

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:08.680
by many English speakers is just plain wrong:
instead of a “dark age” defined by conflicts

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:12.920
between Muslims and Christians who didn’t
understand one another, we encounter urban

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:18.029
centers of trade and knowledge exchange populated
by natural philosophers with a keen desire

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:21.380
to build upon earlier insights regardless
of their origins.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:28.300
Next time—we’ll build many cities and
one very long canal in the rich Middle Kingdom,

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.300
China.

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.730
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:37.120
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120
Thought Cafe.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.770
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:43.570
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:46.040
channels like Scishow, Eons, and Sexplanations.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.220
And, if you’d like to keep Crash Course
free for everybody, forever, you can support

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:55.660
the series at Patreon; a crowdfunding platform
that allows you to support the content you

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:56.700
love.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.510
Thank you to all of our patrons for making
Crash Course possible with their continued

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:01.010
