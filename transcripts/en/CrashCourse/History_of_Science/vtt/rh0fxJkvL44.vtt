00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.930
Pop quiz: are you a Platonist or an Aristotelian?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.870
An idealist or an empiricist?

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.260
Do you think up neat rules to describe the
universe and then try to fit data into your theory?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.820
Or do you observe the world and draw conclusions
from what you see?

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.260
Do you trust math, or your senses?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.440
Before you decide, let’s take a trip to
urban Athens circa 399 BCE…

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:36.600
[Intro Music]

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.430
Last week, we met the Presocratics: despite

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.700
having by any reasonable standard invented
science in Europe, these thinkers are lumped

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.880
together today as simply “not Socrates.”

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.790
So who was this smarty pants?

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.710
Socrates didn’t have a single, clearly formulated
natural philosophy.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.180
He didn’t even study nature!

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.900
He studied politics and morality and prided
himself on not claiming to know things.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.170
But Socrates did two important things: he
asked a lot of questions, which influenced

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.150
how philosophers went about teaching their
ideas.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.600
And he inspired the two rockstars of classical
Greek philosophy.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.900
Socrates held that knowledge comes from asking
questions.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.370
So many questions!

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.830
His name is attached to the Socratic method—in
which you constantly ask questions so that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:30.360
students can steadily break down a big problem
into smaller parts, parts they can test hypotheses against.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.000
It’s okay if they realize that a hypothesis
is wrong: in fact, it’s good!

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.600
It means they’re moving away from falsehood.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.810
The Socratic method is an example of negative
hypothesis elimination, or proving that something

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.130
is wrong to narrow down the possibilities
of what might be right.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.460
But Socrates’s biggest legacy might be his
student, Plato, and his student’s student,

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.460
Aristotle.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.960
Both were inspired by Socrates’s methods,
but they arrived at some very different conclusions

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960
about the world.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.880
We know a lot about Socrates thanks to his

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.880
students.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.690
Chiefly Plato founded a physical school called
the Academy to train Athenians in how to think

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.869
like Socrates.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.670
Plato wrote down dialogues between Socrates
and other thinkers including Parmenides: he

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.620
was the Eleatic philosopher who believed that
nothing really changes, and thus we can’t

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.620
trust our senses.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.989
This had a big impact on Plato.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.140
Whose best known works include Republic, in
which Socrates defines justice and argues

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.060
for rule by philosopher-king instead of democracy, and Timaeus, in which Socrates talks

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.829
about the nature of the universe.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.440
Plato had a big impact on thinking about thinking.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.099
Today, we still use Plato’s name for a place
of philosophical learning, “Academy,”

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.300
to describe the concept of higher education
in general.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.569
At the original Academy, Plato emphasized
training in how to think properly.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.499
Over the door of the Academy was inscribed
the dictum, “Let no one enter here who is

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:54.359
ignorant of geometry.”

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.319
Plato based his own philosophy on geometrical
laws.

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.870
He taught a Pythagoras-inspired idealism,
or a theory of nature based on perfect abstractions—rules,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.059
of which real-world stuff could only ever
be imperfect examples.

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:11.480
So Plato had to fit his observations to his
theory.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.819
That idealism is one of the reasons people
think of Plato as more of a philosopher than

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.819
a scientist.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.629
Plato built on the work of the Presocratic
schools.

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.340
But he developed a more complete way of looking
at the natural world than they did.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.290
And his students took off in search of solutions,
even as they changed his underlying theory.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.969
The only Greek who wrote more philosophy than
Plato was Plato’s own star student and rival,

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:34.969
Aristotle.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.519
Compared to Plato’s idealistic abstractions,

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.680
Aristotle’s philosophy makes more common
sense.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.120
His ideas are based on empirical evidence:
he observed the world and then came up with

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.559
a theory that explained it.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:50.560
This order of operations is at the heart of
modern scientific practices.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.699
Aristotle was from Macedonia, in the north
of Greece.

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:58.290
But he studied at Plato’s Academy in Athens
for twenty years, until Plato died.

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.029
Afterward, Aristotle took a lucrative gig:
King Philip II of Macedonia hired him as tutor

00:04:04.029 --> 00:04:06.309
to his son, Alexander.

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:10.089
And, you know this particular Alexander: he decided
to conquer the entire earth.

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:14.980
Before age thirty, he ruthlessly conquered
much of Asia, Africa, and Europe, ruling over

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.989
more area than anybody until Genghis Khan.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.150
Aristotle’s influence on Alexander
“the Great” reminds us that science is

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.340
always social.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.030
From the very beginning, scientists have served
bad, heartless dudes.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.090
Aristotle, a man who literally wrote the book
Ethics, pushed his most famous pupil to invade

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.200
Persia, kill “barbarians,” and become
a brutal warlord.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.080
After Alexander died young, Aristotle went
back to Athens to start his own school, the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.080
Lyceum.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.330
The Lyceum was pretty different from Plato’s
Academy.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.840
Because Aristotle liked plants and liked to
walk and talk, his school wasn’t in a building,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.270
but a grove of trees outside the city.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.460
And his school was called the Peripatetic,
meaning “walkie” and thus informal—not

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.460
like the Academy.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.900
It was during the Lyceum years that Aristotle
probably wrote many of his most famous works,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.150
including Metaphysics, On the Heavens, On
the Soul—which is actually an amazing book

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.259
of proto-biology-meets-psychology—and his
school’s highly influential set of textbooks

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.370
on natural philosophy, called Physics.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.840
How did Aristotle answer our big questions

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.210
about physics, such as “what was stuff?”

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.210
And “where are we?”

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.580
He posited a complete system, joining the
elements and the heavens.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.960
This became the basis for European thought
about the physical world for two thousand years!

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.940
Let’s compare Aristotle’s system to his
mentor Plato’s in this week’s ThoughtBubble.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.039
For Plato, the cosmos was perfect.

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.750
It had perfect rules that could be studied.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:44.409
And all cosmic stuff was made up of atoms
that were perfect geometric “platonic solids”,

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:50.620
each creating one element: tetrahedrons
of fire, cubes of earth, octahedrons of air,

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.159
icosahedrons of water, and dodecahedrons as
the shape of the whole universe…

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.750
Like a giant celestial set of D&amp;D dice!

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.879
Plato’s theory of the heavens stated that
the wandering stars—that is, the planets—followed

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:05.300
a path of uniform circular motion.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.460
You see,

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.400
the wandering stars must move in perfect circles,
since the cosmos is orderly.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.160
Ah, but
this one is moving backwards!

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.400
Plato’s students could see that Mars, for
one, seemed to jump backwards, showing retrograde

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.400
motion.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.539
Plato didn’t really have an explanation.

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.050
European astronomers would spend the next
two thousand years meticulously trying to

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.220
solve this problem.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.669
They’d end up learning a lot in the process.

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.980
How did Aristotle build on Plato’s system?
Aristotle’s cosmology was abstract, too,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.660
but attempted to make sense of observations
about the world.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:42.560
He crossed those same four elements, plus
a new anti-void one called æther, with four

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:49.270
physical sensations: hot and cold, dry and
wet, and used these to explain everything:

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.590
Earth was the heaviest element, so it was
the center of the cosmos.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.319
Water was lighter than earth so the oceans
rested on top of the earth.

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.400
So far so good.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.530
Air’s natural state is above water.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.310
That also checks out!

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.430
Fire sat on top of air, which is a little
weird… but it does go up, I guess?

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:10.789
And way out beyond these four terrestrial
spheres—out past the Moon—spun the stars,

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:15.810
acting according to their nature as ætherial,
or perfect-circle-moving, objects.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.020
And nowhere, anywhere in this theory, was
a void.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.830
Nature abhors a vacuum!

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.350
In Aristotle’s cosmos, all of the elements
were actively trying to get back to their

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.490
natural states.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.039
Why did flames rise?

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:30.449
They were just trying to get back to the fiery
celestial realm above the air.

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.670
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.110
From the Presocratics to Plato to Aristotle,
we’ve ended up with a bunch of spheres inside

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.889
of spheres, each with a natural tendency.

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.310
This confirmed the average Bronze Age farmer’s
experience… and ours.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.000
The earth seems to stand still.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.569
Water sits on earth.

00:07:47.569 --> 00:07:48.770
Air isn’t very heavy.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.650
Aristotle recognized that elements didn’t
always exist in their pure forms.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.660
A tree, for example, was a combination of
earth, water, and air: roots go down into

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.189
the earth, and branches up into the air.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:02.669
His theory also worked for comparisons.

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:05.860
Why does a book fall faster than a piece of
paper?

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.280
Because it has more earth in it.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.000
Aristotle could even explain natural phenomenon.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.409
Why does rain fall from the sky to the ground?

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:14.320
Why do volcanoes shoot fire up?

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.780
Obviously this isn’t how I think gravity
works, but it’s a way of explaining it that

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:20.479
made sense to the Ancient Greeks.

00:08:20.479 --> 00:08:25.310
Where Plato saw a world of ideal shapes, Aristotle
had a theory that acknowledged that we’re

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.909
all kind of a hot mess.

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:30.789
Things are naturally jumbled up, but always
trying to get back to their essential place.

00:08:30.789 --> 00:08:34.060
[Living things]
Aristotle also loved looking at living things.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.060
And he looked closely.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:39.290
He noticed, for example, that the octopus
can change color—which is awesome—and

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.720
that male octopi have a special arm called
a “hectocotylus”—which is… something

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.730
you should Google.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.730
Because it’s weird and gross but also kind
of awesome.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.000
And it wasn’t confirmed by scientists until
the 1800s!

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.970
Aristotle thus trusted that knowledge proceeded
from the experience of the senses.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.840
In works such as History of Animals, among
others, he wrote down observations like these

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.110
about all kinds of organisms.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.920
He also tried to classify the world in an
orderly system, giving rise to taxonomy.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.510
When he attempted to answer the question “what
is life,” the taxonomy he created relied

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.510
on a system of souls.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.650
Plants have a vegetative soul, responsible
for reproduction and growth.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.450
Animals have a vegetative and a sensitive
or animal soul, responsible for mobility and

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:22.580
sensation.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:28.160
And humans—and only humans—have a vegetative,
a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.940
of thought and reflection.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:36.830
This led Aristotle to further theorize that
all things can be placed on a line from simplest-slash-least-soulful

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.280
to highest-slash-most-soulful.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.000
On one end, he placed plants, then worms,
and so on.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.450
These low animals bore their offspring cold,
dry, and in thick eggs.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.470
The higher animals made warm and wet babies.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:53.790
So of course, at the other end of the line,
Aristotle placed men.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:59.640
Meaning not “humans,” but dudes: according
to him, cold maternal blood produced inferior

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.340
humans, AKA girls, while hot paternal semen
produced boys.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:08.270
Aristotle was… maybe not someone we’d
want to elect as our philosopher-king today?

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.090
But Aristotle’s system of classification
again seemed to confirm his classical and

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.470
medieval readers’ daily experiences.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.420
His proto-biological ideas stuck around in
various forms until Darwin, getting lumped

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.680
under the heading of the Great Chain of Being—that
all creatures on earth stand somewhere on

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.360
a ladder of perfection up toward God.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.520
You may have already guessed that this concept
has been particularly troublesome when it

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.580
comes to scientific racism.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.740
But that’s a story for later.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.330
The creepier effects of some his ideas aside,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.260
Aristotle had an answer for everything.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:44.580
For the most part, these were based in observation
and conformed to common sense.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:48.070
His answers were able to explain how the world
worked…

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.070
most of the time.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.160
And not only did Aristotle come up with a
complete theory of everything, he wrote it

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160
down.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.910
He was a prolific author, and a significant
percentage of his texts have survived thanks

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:00.460
to our Arabian scholars.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.500
Then again, Plato’s transcendental ideas
about the cosmos—even if wrong in their

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.420
particulars—inspired centuries of scholars
to think about the universe as having underlying

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.140
laws, ones that hold regardless of what our
senses can show us.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.480
So are you a Platonist or an Aristotelian?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:21.560
Or, taking a page from Socrates, is that a
trick question!?

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:27.160
Next time—we’ll follow Alexander the Maybe-Not-So-Great
to India to witness the rise of the Maurya

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.960
dynasty, set the earth spinning on its axis,
and found a science of life!

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.800
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.970
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:40.970
Thought Cafe.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:42.600
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:46.220
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.740
