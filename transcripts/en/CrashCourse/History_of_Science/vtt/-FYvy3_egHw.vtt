00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.719
Heliocentrism was central to revolution in
European astronomy.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.830
We’ll follow this idea to its conclusion
with Galileo.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.410
But before we get there, there are two critical
links between Copernicus and Galileo.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.320
This is the story of Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler… and a violent

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.560
math duel.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:32.060
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.720
There are a lot of quirky characters in the

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.730
history of science.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.630
But Tycho Brahe is a true champion of quirk.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.379
Traditionally referred to as “Tycho,”
not by his last name, he was a Danish aristocrat,

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:48.640
born in 1546—three years after De rev dropped
and Copernicus also dropped.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.040
Tycho was a good astronomer.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.970
But maybe a little too serious about knowledge:
my dude got his nose cut off in 1566 during

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.030
a sword duel with his cousin and fellow rich
person Manderup Parsberg.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.269
Their beef was—wait for it—over mathematics.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.640
You have to really love math to lose your
proboscis over it.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.440
After the duel, Tycho had prosthetic noses
made that he could attach to his face with

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440
wax.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.710
But whenever he got angry, he’d heat up
and start sweating, and the wax would melt…

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.480
and his nose would fall off.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.060
...that's real.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.940
In addition to an astronomer, Tycho was an
alchemist and astrologer.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.760
He became so well known as a scientist that
the Danish king kept trying to give him castles

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.600
so he wouldn’t move away.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.480
And Tycho kept turning down castles—until
he got his own private research island, Hven

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.740
On Hven, Tycho built two structures, Uraniborg, or the Castle

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.660
of the Heavens, and Stjerneborg,
or the Castle of the Stars.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.980
Together, these castles represented the most
state-of-the-art research labs of the day.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.340
Here, Tycho built a scientific empire.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.710
He had his own printing press, paper mill,
alchemical equipment, and—most importantly—huge,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.090
expensive instruments and an army of staff
scientists working for him.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.229
In fact, Tycho worked with his younger sister,
Sophie.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.050
Tycho and his staff produced some of the most
precise naked-eye observations of the night

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.280
sky ever.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.299
These were roughly twice as precise as similar
observations by ancient Egyptian, Babylonian,

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.840
and Greek astronomers.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.920
Tycho’s observations were not surpassed
by those made with telescopes for a hundred years.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.800
Tycho believed in a geo-heliocentric cosmos.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.200
In this model, the sun orbits the earth, but
the other planets revolve around the sun.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.030
So Tycho was moving away from Aristotle and
Ptolemy.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.200
And his hybrid model actually solved a bunch
of the math problems astronomers were having

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.010
with the Ptolemaic model…

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.069
But it also placed the sun on a collision
course with the planets.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.319
So, not perfect.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.660
Even if the Tychonic model of the solar system
had flaws, his observations paid off in other ways.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.400
Tycho observed and took precise measurements
of the same sky all the time, noting that

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.620
sometimes “stars” streaked around—these
were comets.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.989
In 1572, he saw a nova stella, er, a new star,
which we now call a supernova.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.439
He noted that this new star didn’t have
a tail or show any stellar parallax, meaning

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.490
an apparent shift in position against a background
of distant objects.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.709
This meant that the new star had to be really,
really, incredibly far away—a true star

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.250
and not a comet.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.800
Moreover, the appearance of a new star meant
that the heavens could change!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.599
God could straight up add new stars!

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.000
If you really believed your whole life that
the heavens were perfect and unchanging, how

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.420
hard would it be to adjust those beliefs just
because you saw one new dim little pinpoint

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.090
of light at night, a dot that nobody else
cared about?

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.710
That’s just what Tycho did: one year after
the supernova, in 1573, he dropped his own

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.849
book: De nova stella, or On the New Star.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:51.790
But after all that hard work, Tycho’s life
ended sadly.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.959
The old Danish king died, and his nineteen-year-old
son took over.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.340
This not-super intellectual new king wanted
his nobles to spend their energy on war, not science.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.680
So he roused up opposition to Tycho’s science
castles, whipping up a mob to drive the patient

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.540
observer into exile.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.150
Thus Tycho moved to Prague, in the Holy Roman
Empire—where he died after only two years

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:18.989
in exile, leaving behind an enormous meticulously
detailed catalogue of observable stars and

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.479
one very well-trained assistant…

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.349
Johannes Kepler was born in 1571 near Stuttgart,
Germany.

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.490
His grandfather was rich, but his dad hadn’t
done so well, dying as a mercenary in the

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:31.490
Netherlands.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.479
Little Joey went to school on scholarship
at a Latin school, seminary, and then the

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.520
University of Tübingen.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.479
Which is still a great school today!

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.830
Go, uh, ‘Bingers!?

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.779
After college, Kepler taught math.

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:49.400
Then, in 1600, Kepler so impressed Tycho that
the older astronomer shared his secret data

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.000
sets with him, and the two become close collaborators.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.290
Then politics happened: Kepler, a devout Lutheran,
was told to convert to Catholicism or leave

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.290
Prague.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.060
Kepler—who used to call himself a “mangy
dog” because he was so full of self-doubt—chose exile.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.100
When Tycho died in 1601, however, Kepler was
immediately ordered to serve as the official

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.809
imperial mathematician and continue Tycho’s
work.

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:13.809
Politics!

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:14.809
Make up your mind!

00:05:14.809 --> 00:05:19.389
As imperial numbers person, Kepler mostly
provided the emperor with advice about astrology.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.610
Remember that astronomy was seen as the less
useful, theoretical cousin of the practical

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:25.830
art of astrology.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.300
But Kepler, thank goodness, kept making time for astronomy.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.740
In addition to the observing and cataloguing
that he’d done with Tycho, Kepler worked

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.419
on optical physics.

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.330
And he observed a new supernova in 1604, in
the foot of a constellation that is supposed

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.639
to depict a Greek dude fighting a giant snake!

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:44.539
(Or just holding it.

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:45.710
We aren’t sure.)

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.499
Kepler wrote his own De nova stella around
1605.

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:53.759
But Kepler is famous thanks to the laws governing
how planets move.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.559
Kepler published Astronomia nova, or A New
Astronomy, in 1609.

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:04.529
This mind-zapper of a tome came from a decade
of looking at Mars to figure out mathematical

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:07.050
formulas that could predict its movements.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.719
ThoughtBubble, show us the Red Planet.

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:15.110
Kepler calculated many versions of Mars’s
orbit using an equant point: this was an imaginary

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.169
point in space that Copernicus had already
figured out how to get rid of.

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.889
Using an equant, Kepler made a model of Mars’s
motion that almost fit Tycho’s crazy-meticulous

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.229
data set of years of observations.

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:29.229
Almost.

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.660
Kepler didn’t just want a close model; he
wanted to understand what was happening up there.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.620
So he threw out his earlier models… and
tried an elliptical or ovoid orbit with the

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:39.849
sun in the center.

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:45.550
And, in writing up his Mars study, he proposed
the first two laws of planetary motion.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.589
The first law states that every planet has
an elliptical orbit, with the sun at one of

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.439
the two foci of the ellipse, not its center.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.259
The second law explains that, even though
the speed at which a planet revolves around

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.909
the sun will vary—because the planet will
travel faster when it’s closer to the sun—you

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.319
can still figure out a constant speed for
the planet, called an area speed.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:12.129
This is the area described by the little pizza
slice shape made when you draw a line from

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:17.339
the planet to the sun at time 1 and then again
at time 2, whatever those times are, and then

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:19.800
fill in the area between the lines.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.110
If you do this again later in the planet’s
trip, with the same interval between time

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.839
points, you’ll get a slice with the same
area.

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:31.680
Sounds complicated, but it was important for
showing that planets do actually move at non-uniform

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.819
speeds—and yet we can describe these motions
very precisely using the right mix of math

00:07:37.819 --> 00:07:40.160
and patient observation of the night sky!

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.449
Thanks Thoughtbubble!

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:44.789
Kepler didn’t write the third law until
1619, by the way.

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:49.759
It explains the relationship between the distance
from planets to the Sun and their orbital

00:07:49.759 --> 00:07:50.759
periods.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:55.159
This law was Kepler’s attempt to explain
the harmony of the “music of the spheres!”

00:07:55.159 --> 00:07:58.939
Alright, so that might not make the best scene
in an action movie: Kepler stops using an

00:07:58.939 --> 00:08:04.020
imaginary dot to make circles move like eggs,
and instead just draws a dang egg.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.740
But this represented a clear break with Aristotle
and Ptolemy and a millennium of Christian

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:09.740
thought.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.520
And Kepler, unlike Copernicus, didn’t hold
back his theory for fear of ridicule by his

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.660
peers or condemnation by the Church.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.530
In fact, religious ideas helped Kepler move
toward a heliocentric, eccentric model: he

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:26.679
saw the sun as a symbol of God the Father,
at the center of things, moving planets faster

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:27.779
when they came closer.

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:31.909
So when Kepler plugged the Mars data into
his new model, and the numbers worked out,

00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:36.580
he probably didn’t rejoice at the triumph
of secular thought over faith.

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:42.740
He rejoiced at a harmony of ideas: his faith,
empirical data, and elegant math—all in

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:43.740
sync!

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.220
Kepler gave European astronomers a theory,
backed by superb math, that explained natural

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.730
phenomena better than Aristotle, Ptolemy,
Oresme, Copernicus, and Tycho could.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:57.690
(Although Kepler built on work by all of them—science
is a team sport!)

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:03.820
But the most famous astronomer from this period
gave astronomers a true research paradigm—ways

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:05.320
to do science all day.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.770
You might know Galileo Galilei, born in 1564, as the person

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.000
who dropped stuff off the side of a messed-up
tower in Pisa.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.060
If you recall episode one, though, you know
that Galileo probably didn’t conduct this

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.800
experiment: the first published account of
it dates from 1657, fifteen years after Galileo died.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.320
And Galileo worked on this theory a decade
after he left Pisa.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.550
That said, he did prove the uniform rate of
falling bodies.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:34.640
And Galileo did lots of other amazing things
for science, earning him uncontested rockstar

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.640
status.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.190
We’ll learn more about his overall contributions
next week.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:39.940
Right now, let’s talk star-gazing.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:46.010
First, Galileo got his hands on a telescope
in 1609 and refined this technology for years,

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.200
which led to more and better observations
of distant planets.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.270
In 1610, he dropped Sidereus Nuncius or

00:09:52.270 --> 00:10:00.370
The Starry Messenger - what a very good title for this book - which was his telescope-enabled
description of the earth’s moon and the

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.760
“stars” orbiting Jupiter—which were its moons.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:08.790
His descriptions were based on literally never-before-possible
observations and included accurate illustrations

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.370
showing mountains on our moon.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:14.520
And these were good drawings, because Galileo
had been trained as a professional artist!

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.290
And, according to Aristotle’s cosmology,
a planet could not orbit another planet other

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.290
than earth.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:25.490
So Sidereus Nuncius represented an empirically
based break with the older model.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.860
Soon after, Galileo went on to make precise
observations of Venus, Saturn, and even Neptune.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.820
Neptune was ultra-dim through the lens of
his telescope, a mere thirty-times magnification

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.980
compared to the naked eye.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:38.300
The best was yet to come.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.090
In his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World
Systems of 1632, Galileo explained the new

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:47.310
astronomy of Copernicus to a wide audience.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:52.160
And he did this in terms of a debate within
science about what counts as good evidence.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:58.500
That is, Galileo saw the birth of a new scientific
paradigm as revolutionary!

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.510
Galileo argued publicly with geocentrists
and believers in Tycho’s hybrid model.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:08.090
Galileo argued that the tides demonstrate
that the earth indeed moves, and that Copernicus’s

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:09.320
model is right.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:16.100
Saying that, as the Earth moves, the oceans slosh around on its surface. He didn't get everything precisely right.

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.620
Interestingly, Galileo knew about Kepler’s
theories but didn’t seem interested in them.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.510
Unfortunately for Galileo, the Church also
saw his work as revolutionary.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.630
The Inquisition banned him from publishing
any new work.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:33.220
But Galileo eventually found
a Dutch publisher for his magnum opus, Two

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:34.410
New Sciences.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:39.940
Published in 1638, it would become one of
the foundational texts detailing a new scientific

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.940
method…

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.400
Next time—we’ll dive into Galileo’s
thoughts about how to do science and meet

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:51.680
two other key scientific methodists, Francis
Bacon—who was not also Shakespeare!—and René Descartes.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.160
Crash Course History of Science is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula, Montana

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:01.760
and it’s made possible with the help of all this nice people and our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:06.220
