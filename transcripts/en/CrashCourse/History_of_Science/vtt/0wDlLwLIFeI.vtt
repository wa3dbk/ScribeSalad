Hi, I’m Hank Green, this is Crash Course,
and today I wanna explore two sites of knowledge

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.700
production in Europe during the medieval period.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.000
This is the story of the cathedral and the
university.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.540
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.500
First, let’s agree to call the general time
period in Eurasia and North Africa after the

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.199
birth of large states

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.800
but before colonial empires the medieval:
a “middle age” that lasted from roughly

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.860
CE 500 to 1400.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.120
So we've got our working definition established!

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.890
Across a large part of the medieval world,
people traded knowledge, and many folks practiced

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.549
different forms of humoral medicine and alchemy.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:54.089
The majority of these explorations of nature
were conducted by individual elites—nobles

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.370
and other rich people who happened to take
an interest in the world around them.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.350
In a few places, however, knowledge production
was highly centralized.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.000
As we’ve seen in Baghdad, Delhi, Beijing,
and Bologna—lots of medieval people were

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.590
making knowledge systematically.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.210
The north of Europe was a different story.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.820
Until roughly 1100, there were relatively
few places of knowledge-making.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.510
Monasteries and abbeys had special rooms called
scriptoria

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.090
where monks copied manuscripts by hand.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.470
But the biggest places where knowledge was
made were the Gothic cathedrals.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.380
Cathedrals were great stone churches that
took years, sometimes many decades to build.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.420
They weren’t simply places to go on Sunday
to worship.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.270
A cathedral was the seat of a bishop, or regional
church leader,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.260
and the administrative, spiritual, and educational
center of the bishopric or diocese—the district

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.250
under the bishop’s control.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.560
And if you wanted to go to one of these places,
that didn’t make you a christian, just like

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.500
going to taco bell doesn’t make you a taco.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.010
And, unlike castles, cathedrals are still
used today for their original purposes.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.380
Choosing a site for a cathedral was high stakes.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.930
While secular rulers paid for cathedrals,
bishops often chose where to build them.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.429
This redrew the map of Europe and made some
cities vastly more important: once a cathedral

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.709
was there, a city grew economically.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.549
As populations grew, bishoprics split.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:14.790
New cathedrals were needed.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.599
While the first cathedrals date back to Constantine
the Great, the high age of cathedral building

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.909
lasted from roughly 1000 to 1500.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.780
This was an era of frantic economic growth
in Europe.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.870
The French, for example, built eighty cathedrals
between 1050 and 1350,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.010
moving more stone for these projects, in total,
than was moved to build the great pyramids!

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.930
The construction of these vast, soaring spaces
required immense technical knowledge.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.640
What made a cathedral such a technical wonder?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.989
Help us out, ThoughtBubble:

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.239
The height of the cathedral was important:
narrow and tall, cathedrals drew the eyes

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.280
of worshippers up, inside and out.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.650
Inside, a Gothic cathedral generally featured
spacious arched vaults, lots of narrow windows

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.960
casting light muted by stain glass, and a big round "Rose" window in the front.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.380
Stained glass was not only an artistic achievement,
but a highly technical one.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.900
Medieval artisans discovered through alchemical
experimentation that adding gold chloride

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.580
to molten glass resulted in a red tint, and
adding silver nitrate turned the glass yellow.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.319
Recently, scientists analyzed stained glass
from this era and discovered that this technique,

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.739
possibly dating back to the tenth century,
worked because of nanotechnology!

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.379
Analysis of the stained glass revealed that
gold and silver nanoparticles, acting as quantum

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.459
dots, reflected red and yellow light, respectively.

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.480
Historians still have no idea how medieval
artisans made this glass.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:46.269
Outside, towers and spires, guarded by gargoyles,
stood tall above the small buildings of the

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:47.269
medieval city.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:52.069
Perhaps the most striking architectural feature
of the cathedral were its flying buttresses—

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.110
arches leaping off the side of the building,
distributing weight down, allowing the great

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.549
stone mass to move up and up.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.330
The physics of flying buttresses reveals how
innovative they were.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.599
High, stone-ceilinged cathedrals generated
heavy outward thrust, a force that had to

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.779
be directed safely down to the ground.

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:15.330
Added to this was the problem of strong winds,
which presented a danger to the tall, skinny

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.160
bodies of cathedrals.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.000
One solution would have been to make the walls
of cathedrals gigantic and thick and ugly.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.160
But that’s not what the cathedral builders
did!

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.400
To move thrust out and down and resist the
wind, buttresses were connected to the main

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.410
building with arms, making them look as though
they were “flying.”

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.940
Capped by intricately carved pinnacles, these
arched supports allowed much light to stream

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.280
in through the stained-glass windows.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.290
They also used less stone, reducing the cost
of materials and labor.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:46.460
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.230
This strategy worked pretty well for many
cathedrals…

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.370
Although the one at Beauvais—with an incredibly
tall choir and a slightly misaligned arched

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.050
vault—partially collapsed in 1284.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.450
For the most part we do not know who designed
the cathedrals.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.020
But we know that economic opportunities in
cathedral cities attracted many skilled artisans.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.070
Each cathedral project was led by a master
builder.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.670
Rough masons cut, mortared, and laid the heavy
stones.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.320
Freemasons completed the more intricate work,
such as the tracery around the rose windows.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.840
These artisans were the engineers of medieval
Europe.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.530
And having large numbers of them move from
location to location was very unusual for

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.840
a time when most people died in the same village
they were born.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.730
These flying-buttressed monumental spaces
didn’t only motivate earthly activity.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.000
They were representations of Paradise on earth.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.720
This Paradise was part of a complex theoretical
system for answering the question “where

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720
are we?”

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.560
The medieval Christian cosmos looked a lot
like the Aristotelian–Ptolemaic one: an

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.070
earthly sphere bounded within a series of
planetary spheres, and beyond that, an ultimate

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.160
heavenly sphere.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.560
But this heaven was literally Paradise, the
home of God.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.840
And below the earth was Hell.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.040
(Dante strikingly detailed this Christianized
model of the Aristotelian cosmos in his Divina

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.040
Commedia.)

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:07.210
You might wonder why the medieval Christians
were so obsessed with death and Hell…

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.100
Well, we don’t want to accuse medieval Europe
of having been some uninteresting “dark age."

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.300
But it could be a pretty rough time and place
to be alive.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.040
A striking example of this grimness is the
Black Death, a plague that swept across Europe

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.400
from 1348 to 1350.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.750
Perhaps spread by flea-ridden merchants traveling
the Silk Road, the plague bacterium, Yersinia

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.750
pestis,

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:37.280
killed anywhere from 75 to 200 million people—which
was 30 to 60 percent of Europe’s total population,

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.560
in two years.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.400
aaaaahhhhh...

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.320
And the plague came back periodically until
the nineteenth century… when cholera pandemics

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.320
arrived!

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.610
Before the Black Death, Europe had grown a
lot.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.770
And it was during this pre-plague period that
universities took off.

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:57.610
Between 1100 and the mid-1300s, population
growth and urbanization led to rise of the

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.750
university: there were more secular conflicts,
so they needed more lawyers.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.170
There were more religious arguments, so they
needed more theologians.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.070
And there were more people—and more were
sick!—so they needed more physicians.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:14.910
The proto-university in Europe was Charlemagne’s
palace at Aachen or Aix, in what is now Germany.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.330
Charlemagne and his successors centralized
knowledge production at the palace.

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.580
From around 800 until about 855, Aachen was
an important site for the production of manuscripts

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.720
including religious and legal texts.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.650
The first true European universities included
Salerno, Bologna, Padua, and Naples in Italy;

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.910
Oxford and Cambridge in England; Paris and
Montpellier in France; and Valencia in Spain.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:41.300
Still looking good, U. Salerno!

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.920
Eleven hundred is the new thirty.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.680
Although they all feature impressive old buildings
today, medieval European universities started

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.860
off as self-governing associations of people
with a common function.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.431
The places where those people taught and learned
could change, but the legal entity of the

00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:57.960
university stayed the same.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.660
In fact, the Latin word universitas even means "Corporation."

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.120
Which is... maybe... accurate today?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.860
Joining this corporation required swearing a Christian oath.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.700
University curricula, or book lists, had to
approved by the Church.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:16.500
This was paradoxically freeing, though, because
it meant that cities and kings had to recognize

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.770
universities as self-governing:

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:23.840
if the Pope said that the faculty of a university
were cool with him, then kings and nobles

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.490
couldn't boss them around so easily.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.810
They could teach and research what they wanted
to, as long as it was vaguely Catholic enough.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.080
Plus, universities became tax exempt!

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.370
Let’s say we are well-off medieval students
ready to make campus visits.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.760
First, our medieval parents lay out our options:
doctor, lawyer, or priest.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.840
Those are real jobs.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.450
If we can’t hack it at one of those, we
can instead study something called the “liberal

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:49.450
arts.”

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.780
Again, here we ware!

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:55.020
Traveling around, we encounter two kinds of
university: in the “Northern” model, such

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.570
as at Paris, the most important discipline
is theology.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:03.460
The University of Paris was incorporated as
an association of these “masters,” or

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:04.460
teachers.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.270
In the “Southern” model, at Montpelier
and the Italian universities, medicine and

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.310
law are the most important subjects.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.240
These universities were incorporated as associations
of students, who had to pay the salaries of

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240
their teachers.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.650
No matter which school we choose, we’ll
need books.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:23.460
Our Scholastic curriculum revolves around
a few core texts, including some names we’ve

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.460
already encountered:

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:29.410
the famous physicians, Aristotle—especially
the Physics—Euclid, Ptolemy, and Archimedes.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.020
And did I mention Aristotle?

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.580
Which books we buy depends on what we’ll
study.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.390
The artis liberalis, or liberal arts, are
divvied up into a group of three, the trivium—

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:44.650
or tools for thinking, which are grammar,
rhetoric and logic—and a group of four,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.180
the quadrivium—or specific subjects,

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.980
which are arithmetic, geometry, astronomy,
and music.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.100
If we decide to study medicine, we’ll read
and reread sayings attributed to Hippocrates,

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:55.100
Aristotle, Galen,

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.090
Ibn-Sina, Al-Razi, Ibn-Rushd and a few Latin writers—

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:02.860
maybe Trota and an amazing abbess named Hildegard
of Bingen.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:07.840
She taught about human health as connected
to the “green” health of the living environment.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.930
Hildegard was way ahead of her time!

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.960
Our teachers’ lectures serve as commentary
on the canonical texts.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:18.830
And there is also some emphasis on learning
from experience—by visiting apothecaries,

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:24.000
shadowing doctors on their rounds, and attending
anatomical dissections… of criminals.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.520
Dissection is everyone’s favorite class!

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.660
Although our liberal arts or medical curricula
are taught as more or less finished sets of

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:34.440
knowledge, this is not to say that no one
can make new knowledge.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.080
It just has to enter the classroom as part
of an ongoing discussion with the long-dead

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.190
“masters.”

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:41.640
And enter it does.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:47.430
By 1200, translations of classical Greek works
lost to the Latin- and Romance-speaking northwest

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.880
of Eurasia came back into the libraries of
universities and monasteries.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.130
These were Latin translations of the Arabic
translations we mentioned back in episode

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.130
seven.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:58.460
What was the result of all this book learnin’?

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.589
For one, medieval Christians had to work harder
and harder to reconcile scientific works by

00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:06.270
their favorite Greek and Arabic masters with
a Christian worldview.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:11.680
Increasingly, the faculty—thinking systematically
about thinking as separate from the Bible—ran

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.130
afoul of the Church.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.820
In 1277, the bishop of Paris officially condemned
219 Aristotelian “errors,”

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:24.120
meaning that anyone teaching certain ideas
from Greek philosophies would be excommunicated.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:28.470
Historians are split on how this affected
science: on the one hand, the suppression

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.720
of Aristotle’s ideas sounds bad.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:35.440
But on the other, this condemnation freed
up medieval thinkers in continental Europe

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.120
to look beyond the so-called “masters.”

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.380
Thought experiments about how Nature might
really work, regardless of the Bible or Aristotle,

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.380
flourished.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:49.940
Separating the study of a thing called “Nature”
out from that of a perfect God, even hypothetically,

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.340
helped set the stage for a secular scientific
program.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:58.779
Nature became God’s delegate, an intermediary
force between God and humanity—something

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:01.140
to study… and, ultimately, control.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:06.200
Control of nature meant first putting it in
the right order: head before toes,

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.580
first causes before final ones, universals
before specifics, and abstractions before

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:12.580
particulars.

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:17.020
This neat Aristotelian order, married to a
Christian interpretation of the world based

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:18.080
on scripture,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.760
would soon come up against theories drawn
from meticulous record-keeping regarding natural

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.930
phenomena… such as astronomical data…

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.960
such as how heavenly bodies move…

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.730
But that’s for next time, when we’ll meet
a certain mathematician who attended four

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:33.350
great universities—

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:37.650
Krackow, Bologna, Padua, and Ferrara—Nicolaus
Copernicus!

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:41.460
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.440
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
Thought Cafe.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.100
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.270
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:52.270
