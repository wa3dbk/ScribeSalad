00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.170
From Georges Méliès’s lunar landscape
to the sands of Tatooine, movies have been

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.110
transporting us to different worlds since
the beginning of cinema.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.660
And a lot of these films use their fantasy
worlds to comment on the real world that we

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.660
all live in.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.060
Avatar can be read as a plea to protect the
natural world, while The Hunger Games takes

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.430
reality TV and income inequality to their
brutal extremes.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.350
And in 2006, a movie took on authoritarianism
and the violent aftershocks of the Spanish

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.410
Civil War—all through the eyes of an innocent
young girl and the fairy tale world she discovers

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.410
in the woods.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.631
Filled with original imagery and drawing on
folklore and fantasy traditions, Pan’s Labyrinth

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.600
takes us on a journey to a place as violent
and cruel as it is beautiful and compassionate.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:53.840
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.790
Acclaimed Mexican writer-director Guillermo

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.430
del Toro was already an established filmmaker
by the time he released Pan’s Labyrinth

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.430
in 2006.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.439
From the gothic horror of Cronos and The Devil’s
Backbone, to the sly humor of his comic book

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.350
adaptation Hellboy, del Toro had built a reputation.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.689
He’s known for embedding rich, sympathetic
characters—especially children and otherworldly

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.869
creatures—in larger than life stories.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.539
With Pan’s Labyrinth, he set out to combine
both these impulses to create a story that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.549
was half fantasy adventure, half historical
political drama.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.409
Set in 1944 just after the Spanish Civil War,
the film follows Ofelia, played with wonder

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.399
and grit by Ivana Baquero.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.409
She’s a young girl traveling with her pregnant
mother to join her stepfather in the Spanish

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.409
countryside.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.040
The forces of fascist dictator Francisco Franco
have an outpost there, from which they hope

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.299
to exterminate the rest of the anti-fascist
rebels hiding in the hills.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.549
And Ofelia’s stepfather, Captain Vidal,
is the commander of this outpost.

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.820
He’s also fascism personified.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.999
Grimly portrayed by Sergi López, Vidal demands
absolute loyalty and sees mercy as a sign

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.999
of weakness.

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:54.659
He won’t hesitate to torture or kill anyone
who even might be a threat to the new Spanish

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.659
government.

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.619
Now, the film opens with an unnamed narrator
telling the story of Princess Moanna, the

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.529
long lost daughter of the King of Underworld.

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:05.259
And Ofelia is a voracious reader, especially
of fairy tales.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.989
So whether that story is coming from her
imagination or her books, or is the actual

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.379
truth of the film is hard to pin down at first.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.170
But the movie does suggest there’s more
to Ofelia’s story than meets the eye.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.599
She escapes Vidal’s outpost and discovers
a fantasy world in an ancient stone labyrinth

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.280
hidden in the nearby woods.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.280
There she meets a faun, as menacing as he
is magical, who tells Ofelia that she may

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.680
be the long lost Princess Moanna.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.629
And she has to complete three tasks to claim
her birthright.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.830
The action of the film then moves back and
forth between these two worlds.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.909
In one, Ofelia’s mother Carmen, played by
Ariadna Gil, fights illness as her due

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:39.909
date nears.

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.659
Meanwhile, Vidal hunts the rebels, and Vidal’s
housekeeper Mercedes embarks on a dangerous

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:44.700
mission to aid them.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.959
And in the fantasy realm, Ofelia gets a key
from the belly of a giant toad, reclaims a

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.750
dagger from a child-eating monster called
the Pale Man, and finally – after her mother

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.810
dies in childbirth and the rebels storm the
outpost – she steals her baby half-brother

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.019
and brings him to the center of the labyrinth.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.379
There, Ofelia is confronted with a final choice,
to give the baby to the faun as a sacrifice

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.549
or return him to the villainous Vidal.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.349
In the ultimate selfless act, Ofelia refuses
them both, protecting her half-brother’s

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.530
life with her own.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.249
Vidal grabs the child and – spoiler alert
– shoots Ofelia, leaving her for dead.

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:21.670
As her blood drips down into the labyrinth,
Ofelia is magically transported to a golden

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.900
throne room.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.200
She finds herself healed, dressed in beautiful
clothes, and wearing… not quite Ruby Slippers,

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.409
but definitely red shoes.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:34.439
Her mother and father sit on two impossibly
tall thrones, with a third seat for her.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.170
Her family is reunited.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.260
And while we see Ofelia die in the real world,
the closing narration tells us that she reigned

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.579
for centuries in the Underworld, that she
was beloved by her people, and that traces

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.889
of her can still be found if you know where
to look.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.640
The film ends on the image of a flower opening
on a branch Ofelia had once touched, suggesting

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640
just that.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.129
Pan’s Labyrinth is a film of strong contradictions,
as beautiful as it is bloody.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.409
It’s a fairy tale about a child, but also
a violent, R-rated film clearly made for adults.

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.069
Our job as film critics is to reconcile these
contradictions as we construct our reading

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.069
of the movie.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.209
One way to look at Pan’s Labyrinth is to
consider it through the lens of folklore.

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.200
Scholars have long suggested that fairy tales
give children a framework to understanding

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.170
the sometimes arbitrary and brutal world of
adults.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.030
In this reading, the fantasy world operates
as Ofelia’s way to interpret the real world.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.250
I mean, think about it: here’s a young girl,
dumped onto the front lines of a violent conflict,

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.780
perpetrated by this scary man she’s expected
to call “Father.”

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.110
And on top of it all, her mother’s in real
danger.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.650
The only way for Ofelia’s mind to cope is
to create a fantasy world through which she

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.650
can explore and understand what’s actually
happening to her.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.090
And what’s actually happening is downright
disgusting.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.650
del Toro rarely pulls the camera away from
violence, forcing us to confront Vidal’s

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.099
homicidal wrath as he smashes a man’s face
with a wine bottle, prepares to torture a

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.220
rebel, or shoots half a dozen people in cold
blood.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.780
Ofelia doesn’t necessarily witness all of
these attacks.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.080
But Vidal’s menace and sadism is so intense
that the film suggests that Ofelia lives in

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.389
terror in his house.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.830
Which is exactly why Ofelia has invented
the fairy tale half of the film.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.000
American scholar and fairy tale expert Jack
Zipes writes in the Journal

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.270
of American Folklore: “[Ofelia] wills
herself into this tale … and creates it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.169
so that she can deal with forces (her mother,
Vidal, the end of the Civil War) impinging

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.300
on her life.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.580
What happens in the fairy tale is what provides
her with the courage to oppose the real cruelty

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:20.670
of monstrous people.”

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.360
Seen this way, when Ofelia outsmarts the giant
toad and extracts the key or uses her ingenuity

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.290
to outwit and outrun the Pale Man, she’s
actually figuring out how to stand up to the

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.740
adults in her life who are ill-equipped or
not willing to protect her.

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.430
del Toro’s genius is to go back past the
sanitized Disney version of fairy tales to

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:38.960
their more barbaric origins.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.620
In Pan’s Labyrinth, the fantasy world seems
as merciless as the real one.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.770
The toad is nearly as big as Ofelia and seems
like it could eat her.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.039
The Pale Man bites the heads off two little
fairies in graphic detail.

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.960
And the faun clearly plans to sacrifice Ofelia’s
infant half-brother with the dagger she recovered.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.270
So, really, Ofelia doesn’t really escape
the atrocities of fascist Spain, but she learns

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.540
to come to terms with them, by refracting
them through the lens of these stories she loves.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.060
Del Toro draws inspiration from a wide range
of tales, novels, and films to build the world

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.150
of Pan’s Labyrinth.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.810
Everything from the early stories of Snow
White and Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland,

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.750
to The Wizard of Oz and ancient Greek myths.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.550
He even draws on the most famous Spanish novel
of all, Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.360
That story also follows a protagonist whose
fantastical visions help him cope with the

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.380
trials of the real world.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.220
But that’s not the only way to read Pan’s
Labyrinth.

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.099
Another, more radical, approach suggests that
the fairy tale world might be just as real

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.810
as the one crawling with fascist soldiers.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.190
This reading takes its cues from what Guillermo
del Toro himself has said about the film.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:39.389
Now, since the late 1930s, it’s been out
of fashion to take into account an author’s

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:41.360
intent when analyzing a piece of film.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.449
But that doesn’t mean it can’t be useful.

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:45.050
Especially if there’s evidence to support
their ideas.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.539
Guillermo del Toro has said the he wanted
to make a film about “authority and disobedience.”

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:52.870
And when you look at the film through this
lens, the movie’s contradictions and characters

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.880
can be divided up in a different way.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.520
Some characters, like Captain Vidal, his soldiers,
and Carmen, represent authority.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.350
Vidal and his lieutenants issue commands and
enforce order.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:06.699
Carmen obeys, even when it puts her, Ofelia,
or her unborn child at risk.

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.300
Other characters represent disobedience.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.440
Like, time and again, Ofelia refuses to follow
the rules.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.680
She wanders off on dangerous adventures, gets
her fancy clothes dirty, and nearly dies in

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.920
one terrifying sequence when she disobeys
the faun and eats food from the Pale Man’s table.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:24.120
Mercedes disobeys Vidal by sneaking food,
medicine, and information to the rebels.

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.000
And they’re engaged in the ultimate act
of disobedience: all-out war against the new

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
fascist government.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.259
At first, the film seems to break down along
clean lines.

00:07:32.259 --> 00:07:34.080
Fascism and allegiance to power are bad.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.479
Resistance and hope are good.

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:37.949
But where does the faun fit into all this?

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:42.210
He’s part of Ofelia’s disruptive fantasy
world, but he also abandons her when she dares

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.590
to disobey him.

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.389
And he only returns when she agrees to do
exactly as he says.

00:07:47.389 --> 00:07:49.680
In the end, he demands blind loyalty.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.680
Just like Vidal.

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.530
Really, Ofelia’s life is more often in danger
in the fantasy world.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.659
It’s just as dark and cruel as the world
of Vidal and the rebels.

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:58.690
And maybe it’s just as real, too.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:02.800
So what if the fantasy realm is not just a
child’s coping mechanism, but it’s an

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.879
actual reality within the world of the film?

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:08.070
The filmmaking techniques del Toro uses seem
to support this view.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.599
In shot after shot, the camera moves fluidly
between the two worlds.

00:08:11.599 --> 00:08:16.020
He often uses the trees or walls to hide wipe-cuts
that make it feel like fantasy and reality

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.020
are connected.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.550
Several times, del Toro even moves back and
forth between the dimensions in uninterrupted

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:21.729
single shots.

00:08:21.729 --> 00:08:24.620
Which also suggests that they’re both part
of a single reality.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.460
Finally, objects from the fairy tale world
sometimes show up in the real world.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.280
Things like a special key, a mandrake root,
and a magical piece of chalk all make the

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280
transition.

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.600
What first seems to be a film divided cleanly
between fantasy and reality, turns out to

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.960
be much more ambiguous.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.080
As the Canadian scholar Jennifer Orme puts it: “This ambiguity is … crucial

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.420
to the film’s social critique of the systemic
violence employed by militaristic regimes

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.750
that wish to create, as Vidal says, a ‘clean’
and decidedly unambiguous world by destroying

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:16.040
all that is disobedient—all that does not
fit into the master narrative of totalitarianism.”

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:20.760
Guillermo del Toro refuses to obey contemporary
conventions of fairy tales as clean and safe

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.040
stories for children.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.590
He refuses to draw a clear line between the
real and the fantastical.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.280
And he refuses to make one reality clearly
good.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.260
By doing all this, del Toro has made a film
that, in itself, is an act of rebellion against

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.280
unquestioned authority.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.500
However you choose to look at Pan’s Labyrinth,
the film stands as a remarkable achievement

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.420
of narrative and technical mastery.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.960
It’s also a deeply tragic story. Del Toro once said:

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.760
Guillermo Del Toro: War is the ultimate act of intolerance.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.220
War gives no honor. In my mind, it gives no victory.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:58.620
And there are no winners, only losers.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.360
There's only live victims and dead victims.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.720
And few films drive home that point as elegantly
as Pan’s Labyrinth.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:08.280
...Or The Devil’s Backbone… you should
watch The Devil’s Backbone too.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.480
Whether you think Ofelia’s escaping into
her imagination, or involved in an actual

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.410
quest, the horrors of Franco’s fascist regime
provide the perfect backdrop for this story

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.630
of innocence as the ultimate hope for the
future.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:25.830
Next time, we’ll follow a British criminal
as he scours LA and his own soul in search

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:29.830
of his daughter’s killers in Steven Soderbergh’s revenge thriller The Limey.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.880
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.370

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.630

and Eons.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:44.280
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:50.640
with the help of these [nice people] and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
