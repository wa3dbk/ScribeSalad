00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.100
They make movies about all kinds of things
these days.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.160
From superheroes saving the universe and women
of color using math to win the space race,

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.179
to the brutal horror of something like The
Human Centipede.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.179
Ew.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.820
But there are some topics that filmmakers
shy away from, even today.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.220
While movies can take bold stands on controversial
issues, they usually root stories in safer territory.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.660
In fact, back in the 1910s in the heart of
Hollywood, a director named Lois Weber found

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.439
a lot of success making films about the most
pressing social issues of her time.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.970
And one of her signature films is a drama
from 1916 that took on one of the most contentious

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.320
subjects in American life: abortion.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:50.660
[intro music plays]

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.610
Lois Weber was kind of an anomaly in the early

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.789
days of Hollywood.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.649
She was an extremely successful filmmaker
in an industry that’s dominated by men.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.960
Weber began her film career in the transitional
period of cinema history, around 1907 to 1913,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.120
when mainstream movies started to look like
movies today.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.120
They were feature-length fictional narratives,
told with traditional film grammar, and supported

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.300
by a star system.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.330
A big name associated with the time is D.W. Griffith,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.480
who used sophisticated tools of
film grammar – things like close-ups, cross-cutting,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.600
and subtle performances – to involve audiences
in the emotions of his characters.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.320
Collaborating with her husband Phillips Smalley,
Lois Weber made a series of wildly successful

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.470
films that also experimented with film grammar
to engage people.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.410
She pioneered some unusual techniques, from
split screens to superimpositions.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.170
She was one of the first filmmakers to experiment
with synchronous sound.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.540
And she was the first female director to own
her own film studio.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.520
Not only that, but all of her early films
tackled hot button issues more directly than

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.470
the work of most of her peers.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.970
With titles like Shoes, The People vs. John
Doe, and The Devil’s Brew, she took on subjects

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.940
like child labor, capital punishment, and
temperance.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.210
In 1917, she made a film called Is a Woman
a Person?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.180
– released as The Hand the Rocks the Cradle.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.640
It was about Margaret Sanger’s real-life
arrest for spreading information about birth control.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.180
Weber was quoted at the time saying, “My
close study of the editorial page has taught

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.170
me that … its effect is far reaching upon
thousands of readers.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.989
I feel that, like them, I can … also deliver
a message to the world … that will receive

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.879
a ready and cheerful response from the better
element of the big general public.”

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.890
One reason she was able to grapple with these
social issues so directly is that she was

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.540
making her films before 1930.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.490
That’s when Hollywood instituted the Motion
Picture Production Code, also known as the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:32.430
Hays Code, which we covered in Crash Course
Film History with Craig.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.620
Besides prohibiting things like nudity, sex,
violence, and drug use, the Hays Code said

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.069
that films couldn’t directly address controversial
issues.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.120
Filmmakers had to rely on subtext and innuendo
instead.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.639
So Lois Weber’s films can be kind of startling
for us to watch nowadays.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:50.010
We’re used to old, black-and-white movies
feeling restrained or stuffy – not confronting

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.549
social issues that are still relevant even
today.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.920
And one of the best examples of her work comes
from 1916.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.989
Where Are My Children dives straight into
the controversial topic of abortion.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.620
The film combines Weber’s sophisticated
grasp of cinema, her deep desire to explore

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.319
social issues, and her sometimes flawed point
of view.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.159
There are a couple ways to dissect Where Are
My Children, and first we’re going to look

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.230
at it through a historical lens – in terms
of social issues as well as filmic techniques.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.819
Where Are My Children tells the story of a
District Attorney named Richard Walton, played

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.299
by the imposing Tyrone Power, Sr., and his
wife, known only as Mrs. Walton, played by

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.299
Helen Riaume.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.189
The couple is childless, and the film goes
to great lengths to show how much Mr. Walton

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.569
wants kids.

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.200
We see him looking wistful, enjoying the neighborhood
children, and fawning over his sister’s baby.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.579
Mrs. Walton, we discover, would rather play
with her puppy and hang out with other high

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.609
society women than raise children.

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.260
When one of Mrs. Walton’s friends confides
in her that she’s pregnant, Mrs. Walton

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.530
brings her to Dr. Malfit, a physician who
has performed abortions for Mrs. Walton and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.819
many of her friends.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:47.819
Also…

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.290
Dr. Malfit?

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.150
Coulda just named him Dr. Bad Guy or Dr. Evil.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.150
But, whatever...

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.749
As the film progresses, Mrs. Walton has a
change of heart and decides that she is

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:58.010
ready to start a family.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.470
And then, we’re told that her history of
abortions has left her unable to bear children.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.159
Meanwhile, her lecherous brother comes to
visit and seduces her housekeeper’s young

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.150
daughter, leaving her pregnant.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.639
The young woman seeks help from Mrs. Walton,
who sends the girl to Dr. Malfit.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.019
This time, the procedure goes badly and the
young woman dies.

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.180
Enraged, Mr. Walton attacks his brother-in-law
and prosecutes Dr. Malfit, who is sentenced

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.090
to fifteen years hard labor.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.740
Before the doctor is taken away, he warns
Mr. Walton to examine his own family before

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.139
he starts casting blame.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.660
In the doctor’s ledger, Mr. Walton discovers
his wife’s name, along with many of her friends.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.080
He confronts them and accuses his wife of
murder.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.009
In the film’s final moments, we see the
Waltons sitting by the fire, visited by the

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.139
spirits of the children they never had.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.039
It’s a remarkable effect that keeps unfolding,
as the Waltons grow old before our eyes and

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.150
their now-grown children fade into and out
of the shot one last time.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.720
Not exactly a happy ending!

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.629
Now, this film grapples with tough ideas like
reproductive rights, which isn’t an easy

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:57.870
conversation to have.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.889
But if you look closely at what the movie’s
trying to say, what at first seems like

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.319
a progressive stance ends up being a bit self-contradictory.

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.030
Early in the film, Mr. Walton somewhat reluctantly
prosecutes a man for distributing pro-birth-control

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.419
literature, which at the time was illegal.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.990
During the man’s testimony, we flash back
to his work with the poor, their homes full

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.460
of disease, domestic abuse, and even suicide.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.100
The defendant argues that if these women had
access to birth control, there would be less

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.360
suffering in their communities.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.840
When the jury, which is clearly made up of
only men, vote to convict the defendant, Mr.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.860
Walton seems troubled by the verdict.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.889
So at face value, Where Are My Children seems
to be advocating for more access to birth

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.560
control, or at the very least more access
to information about birth control.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.599
However, its argument is based on a notion
that we now recognize as deeply flawed: eugenics.

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.450
Eugenics was a pseudo-science that was popular
in the early 20th century.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.620
Essentially, it’s the idea that controlling
which humans can have babies could increase

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.350
so-called “desirable” genetic and behavioral
traits across a population.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.460
It was an incredibly racist and classist movement.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:01.689
Proponents of eugenics like Karl Pearson of
the University of London argued that the relatively

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:05.460
high birth rate among the poor was a threat
to civilization.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.750
Taken to its logical extreme, eugenics was
practiced by the Nazi regime in Germany in

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.479
the 1930s, paving the way for the Holocaust.

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:16.400
And while Weber’s film does argue for
access to birth control for poor women,

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.930
the wealthy women are punished for seeking
abortions.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.199
They’re subjected to Mr. Walton’s fury,
Mrs. Walton can’t have children anymore,

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.740
and the housekeeper’s daughter dies.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.500
In general, the film portrays the women of
the elite class as selfish and irresponsible,basically

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.419
shaming them for not wanting to be mothers.

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:35.470
That’s reinforced by Mr. Walton, who’s
presented as a noble and ultimately tragic

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.080
figure because he never gets the family he
wanted.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.759
So while it’s cool that this film directed
by a woman grapples boldly with controversial

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:46.569
subject matter, it’s important to recognize
that it also falls victim to some grave misconceptions

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.280
and prejudices of the time.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.980
We can think critically about this film as
a sort of cultural time capsule because of

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.879
our current understanding and discussions
of these complicated ideas.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:58.289
But we can also evaluate this film from a
technical point of view.

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.759
And through that lens, it’s a remarkably
sophisticated work, for being made just twenty-one

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.569
years after the birth of movies.

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:08.240
At key moments throughout the film, Weber
uses close-ups to great effect.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.620
Remember that camera technique and language
was still being developed alongside actors’

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.620
performances.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.129
When the housekeeper’s daughter realizes
she’s pregnant, Weber cuts to a closer shot

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:18.319
to register her conflicted emotions.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:22.660
Or when Dr. Malfit is sentenced to hard labor,
we get a close-up to see his desperation.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.690
And that moment leads to Weber’s most
sophisticated use of dramatic irony, which

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.790
was also pretty new to cinema in 1916.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:32.990
Dramatic Irony is where the audience understands the
full significance of a moment or action, but

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:35.289
the characters in the story don’t yet.

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:39.610
After Mr. Walton has read Dr. Malfit’s ledger
and found the names of his wife and her friends,

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:42.560
he returns home to confront them but doesn’t
speak right away.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.169
We know what’s about to go down, but Mrs.
Walton and her partying friends don’t.

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:50.759
And that suspense makes the eruption of anger
that much more effective.

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:54.449
Now, other filmmakers at that time were good
at special effects, and Weber had skills too.

00:07:54.449 --> 00:07:58.689
The film opens with a title card announcing:
“the great portals of Eternity,” followed

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:04.379
by a special effects shot of a huge gate opening
to reveal pillars, angels, and celestial clouds.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.580
She’s using forced perspective, superimpositions,
and smoke to create an impressive, heavenly effect.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.780
But Weber also used special effects to get
us to feel for the characters.

00:08:13.789 --> 00:08:16.289
She found ways to trick our eye and affect
our heart.

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:20.539
Twice when characters discover they’re pregnant,
Weber superimposes a little cherub into the

00:08:20.539 --> 00:08:24.960
shot, as though an angelic unborn soul is
whispering to the would-be mother.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.189
It’s an impressive way to give us important
plot information, especially in a silent film.

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:32.240
But this also helps us empathize with the
characters’ conflicted emotions.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.539
And the final shot of the film, where the
aging Waltons are visited by the spirits of

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.860
the children they never had, is undeniably
moving.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.169
No matter how you feel about how the filmmakers
portrayed the characters and the idea of abortion,

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:46.940
this shifting image illustrates the pain and
regret that can come with thinking about roads

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:47.940
not taken.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.890
So Where Are My Children is a landmark achievement,
representing a director at the height of her

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:56.210
power, combining technical mastery with a
deep understanding of complex human emotions.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:01.029
And it’s Lois Weber’s time capsule that
tackles a social issue so controversial that

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:04.440
most modern mainstream filmmakers hesitate
to touch it today.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.040
Next time, we’ll travel across the globe
and ahead in time to an equally heartbreaking

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.060
story of social taboos and unrequited love
from a contemporary master of cinema: In The

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.440
Mood for Love, directed by Wong Kar-wai.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.440
