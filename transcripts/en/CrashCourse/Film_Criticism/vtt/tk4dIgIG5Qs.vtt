Thanks to Curiosity Stream for supporting Crash Course.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.180
In 1965, a brave and dedicated group of people
were a part of one of the greatest non-violent

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.580
Civil Rights demonstrations in U.S. history.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.869
Led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the march
from Selma, Alabama to the state capitol of

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.590
Montgomery was a turning point in the fight
for voting rights.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.450
The march’s organizers endured insults,
threats, physical violence, self-doubt, internal

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.460
division, and even death in the struggle to
guarantee access to the ballot box.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
It took almost 60 years to bring that story
to the screen.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.830
And when Selma finally arrived in 2014, it
was greeted with cheers and awards… along

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.160
with complaints and questions about its historical
accuracy.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.920
As film critics, our job is to apply different
critical lenses to a film, to help us unlock

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.059
different meanings.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.280
So critiquing a film like Selma through a
framework of history is one way to do it,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.020
but it’s certainly not the only way to
evaluate it as art.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:12.840
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.520
It took nearly a decade for Selma to get made.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.500
The film’s producers worked with a number
of directors and sought funding from a lot

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.310
of sources before they hit upon the perfect
combination of talent and vision in Ava DuVernay.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.120
As a woman and a person of color, DuVernay
stands out among modern American feature filmmakers.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.580
She had only directed two small independent
films before bringing her unique perspective

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.590
to Selma.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.560
And, in fact, with Selma she became the first
woman of color ever to direct a Best Picture nominee.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.220
Which is… an honor, but also really depressing
because it reveals a serious lack of inclusion

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
in Hollywood.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.200
The American studio system has a long history
of denying underrepresented voices positions

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.320
of power behind the camera and at the film
studios who actually decide which movies get made.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.000
Ava DuVernay has emerged as a leading figure
pushing Hollywood to include women and people

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.380
of color a seat at those tables.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.130
As she puts it, “There’s a ‘belonging’
problem in Hollywood.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.750
Change has to happen.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.580
Inclusion is necessary for survival.”

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.840
Written by Paul Webb, the script for Selma
takes place over three months as Martin Luther

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.120
King, Jr., played by David Oyelowo, presses
President Lyndon Johnson to pass the Voting Rights Act.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.660
King: Now, you asked how you can help.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.160
King: We want Federal legislation granting negros the right to vote unencumbered.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.050
At the time, many state governments kept African-American
citizens from registering to vote with administrative

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.610
hurdles, intimidation, and outright fraud.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.480
We watch as King struggles to convince Johnson
to do something about this problem, using

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.850
non-violent tactics to force his hand.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.250
Not to mention, King is also navigating divisions
within the Civil Rights movement and his own

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.690
strained marriage.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.550
All while he’s under constant FBI surveillance!

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.360
King’s followers try three times to cross
the now-infamous Edmund Pettus Bridge to start

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.450
their 54-mile march to Montgomery, Alabama.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.570
During these attempts, the marchers are beaten,
whipped, tear gassed, and in some cases killed.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.430
It's only after this brutality is aired on national
TV,  that Johnson finally sends the Voting Rights

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.520
Act to Congress and the national guard to
protect the marchers.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.480
And the film ends with King’s speech on
the steps of the State House, along with one-sentence

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.270
subtitles explaining what key characters would
go on to do.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.680
Selma is a historical drama, and many of the
film’s critics honed in on the history,

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.570
comparing the events and people to their real
life counterparts.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.900
But as James L. Deutsch pointed out in The
Journal of American History, there were many

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.850
historical films released in 2014 – from
Unbroken and The Imitation Game, to Wild and

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.900
American Sniper.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.901
And of those films, it was Selma that “sparked
the most acrimonious debates in op-eds and

00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:39.280
newspaper columns, radio and television talk
shows, [and] the blogosophere.”

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.180
He goes on to say, “This is not surprising,
given the contentiousness that surrounds issues

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.790
of race in the twenty-first-century United
States.”

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.350
Now, used correctly, historical analysis
is a perfectly valid way to evaluate a film.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.230
As long as there have been movies and television
depicting historical events, there have been

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.160
audiences who take them as pure fact.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.620
So it’s important for films to get at least
some of those real life events right.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.680
Stray too far and you can really mess up history
in people’s minds **cough cough** Braveheart

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.130
And Selma definitely does alter some history

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.959
in favor of drama at times.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.709
For one thing, the film changes the order
of key events.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.490
It opens with King accepting the Nobel Peace
Prize.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.660
And we listen to his acceptance speech over
a transition to a new scene, where children

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.800
are descending a stairway only to be killed
by a bomb.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.910
Now, both these events happened, but the film
leads us to believe they happened close to

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.030
the same time.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.840
In real life, though, the bombing took place
more than a year before King spoke in Oslo.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.380
Other critics point to the scenes between
President Johnson and Dr. King, suggesting

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.520
that the film doesn’t give Johnson enough
credit for supporting voting rights.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.960
Johnson: Well Dr. King, you've certainly given me something to think about...

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.780
Johnson: ...but, this administration is going to set this aside for a while.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.840
The film also suggests that the events of
Bloody Sunday were broadcast live across the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.080
country, as Alabama State Troopers brutalized
the peaceful marchers on their first attempt

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.610
to cross the bridge out of Selma.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.580
DuVernay intercuts this violence with shots
of horrified viewers in living rooms throughout the U.S.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.800
But, in reality, the national news didn’t
broadcast the attack until five hours later.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.090
Much of the nation did react, they just
didn’t do it in real time.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.840
So does Selma take liberties with the facts
of history?

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.840
For sure.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.169
After all, it’s a dramatic interpretation
of that history.

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.100
If you think adapting a novel is tough, just
try adapting reality into a movie.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.190
How things happen, when things happen, and
where things happen in life are genuinely

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.880
cluttered and difficult to fit into a linear
narrative.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.880
To condense all of that into a 2 hour experience
that not only makes sense but is emotionally

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.370
potent is more than a little challenging.

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.180
Which also brings up another point.

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.080
Films, even most documentaries, aren’t intended
to be a list of events as they happened, devoid

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.370
of emotional impact.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.680
They are intended to move us, and move us
from a perspective.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.570
Usually, the director’s perspective.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:54.169
And when a film gets right as many events
as Selma does, a purely historical analysis

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.660
doesn’t seem like the most useful form of
film criticism to evaluate it.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.930
There’s a school of thought that says the
first few minutes of a well-constructed movie

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.860
will teach us how to watch it, so we can start
by delving into those first scenes.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.040
The film opens with King’s words spoken
over a black screen.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.720
It’s not the booming voice of his most famous
speeches.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.620
It’s soft, low, and almost tentative.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:20.120
King: I accept this honor for our lost ones.  Whose deaths pave our path.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.790
The first shot is a close-up of King facing
the camera in a dark room, practicing a speech,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.010
and doing a terrible job of tying an ascot.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.860
Then his wife, Coretta Scott King, played
by Carmen Ejogo, enters the room.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.490
She helps him tie the ascot, and we get an
intimate view of their relationship.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:38.620
The lighting is dark and the framing is relatively
still, isolating these two as they struggle

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.949
to balance their work, their public personas,
and their marriage.

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.020
In the next scene, King receives his Nobel
Peace Prize.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.140
DuVernay now uses more traditionally heroic
angles, keeping us slightly lower than King

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.970
and craning up, making him seem larger than
life, the public figure of popular myth.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.259
These scenes give us two different Kings,
one private – introspective and doubting

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:00.990
– and one public – confident and majestic.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.949
Finally, the third scene gives us those kids
walking down the church stairs.

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.650
When the bomb goes off, it rips through the
wall, cutting them off mid-sentence.

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:10.850
The violence is unexpected and immediate.

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:11.850
It’s shocking.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.100
Then, DuVernay does something interesting.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.230
As the explosion blows apart both brick and
flesh, she slows the images down until they’re

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.230
almost abstract.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.440
It becomes difficult to tell people from objects
as they whirl across the screen, crossfading

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.310
into one another in slow motion.

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.960
This extends the horror, but also suggests
that the aftermath of this kind of racist

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.130
violence will last much longer than the bomb
itself.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:39.680
This third scene also underlines the main
duality of the film – the collision of private

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.229
and public spaces.

00:07:41.229 --> 00:07:45.410
This intimate childhood moment is invaded
by a terrorist’s explosive.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:48.050
And these themes show up again and again throughout
the rest of the film.

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.270
The framing of that first shot, with King
squared off to the camera, is repeated often

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.530
– from King and his aides to regular people
joining the march.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.780
By presenting their characters boldly, unapologetically,
facing off with us, DuVernay and her cinematographer

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.020
Bradford Young reinforce the idea that this
movie is about people demanding their dignity

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.420
in the face of both incredible violence and
apathy.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.490
This film also keeps exploring the juxtaposition
of private and public spaces.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:16.290
In intimate moments, DuVernay’s King lowers
his guard and shares his fears.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.350
These scenes are almost always shot at night,
in houses, churches, and jail cells.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.520
In an early scene, King makes a late-night
phone call to gospel singer Mahalia Jackson

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.330
after an emotional low-point.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.270
She sings “Take My Hand, Precious Lord”
as King gathers strength, alone, in his dark

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:32.270
kitchen.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.870
Echoing that scene much later, King goes for
a midnight drive with John Lewis, one of his

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.240
youngest supporters, and expresses grave doubts
about their mission.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.040
This time, instead of a song, Lewis speaks
about his own experience being inspired by

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.060
King and urges him to continue on his path.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:52.620
Lewis: The next day, I found myself patched up, and sittin' in a church.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:59.480
Lewis: Barely hold my head up, but I needed to be there. You were gonna be speaking.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.870
This public-private juxtaposition is also
embodied in David Oyelowo’s performance.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.860
King’s physicality and vocal cadence change
depending on his audience.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.470
From restrained but firm with Johnson, to
soft and anguished with Coretta, and righteous

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:13.480
before the microphones.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.240
This version of King is a close examination
of what it means – and what it costs – for

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.879
people of color to code switch, or change
their style of presentation to fit the moment.

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:26.570
That said, no space was totally private
for King, either.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:30.889
At key points throughout the movie, subtitles
on the screen give us notes from the FBI surveillance

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:34.589
logs with details about King’s movements,
visitors, and phone calls.

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:39.089
It’s a chilling reminder that even his most
intimate moments are being monitored.

00:09:39.089 --> 00:09:43.490
The examination of public and private space
comes up in scenes without King, too.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.360
Oprah Winfrey plays Annie Lee Cooper, a character
who tries to register to vote.

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.879
She approaches the county clerk who humiliates
and threatens her, before finally denying

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:54.589
her application – for the fifth time!

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:58.730
The message is clear: public spaces in this
part of the South were effectively off-limits

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.470
to a big chunk of the population.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.089
Political figures like President Johnson and
the George Wallace, the white supremacist

00:10:04.089 --> 00:10:08.790
governor of Alabama, also privately struggle
with their own doubts in interior scenes – but

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.199
always during the daytime.

00:10:10.199 --> 00:10:12.519
They have power, the movie tells us.

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:14.739
The question for them is how they’re going
to use it.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:19.149
In the film’s climactic moments, these public
and private spaces finally collide and are

00:10:19.149 --> 00:10:20.819
punctuated by destruction.

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:24.739
When an Alabama State Trooper shoots an unarmed
black man, or thugs beat to death a white

00:10:24.739 --> 00:10:28.540
pastor from Boston, DuVernay again slows the
action.

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.019
She forces us to endure the violence and contemplate
its aftermath.

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:35.550
Both these acts of violence take place at
night, which the film has already coded as

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.670
private space.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.110
But then DuVernay breaks this pattern to depict
the Bloody Sunday violence, again in slow

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:44.199
motion, when marchers were beaten on the Edmund
Pettus Bridge.

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:48.019
It takes place in broad daylight, under the
watchful eye of television cameras.

00:10:48.019 --> 00:10:51.569
And this is where the film crosscuts between
the public violence and the folks at home

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:54.529
– in their private spaces – recoiling
in horror.

00:10:54.529 --> 00:10:58.689
Even though it breaks the historical chronology,
intercutting these events completes the theme

00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:02.760
of the movie, thrusting the usually private
pain and violence into the glaring light of

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.980
public scrutiny.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.480
Once again, DuVernay is using the tools of
cinema here – shots, cuts, and sound – to

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.819
reinforce her film’s message in subtle and
sophisticated ways.

00:11:11.819 --> 00:11:15.321
There are lots of other things to say about
Selma, on matters from race and class, to

00:11:15.321 --> 00:11:17.199
gender equity and social justice.

00:11:17.199 --> 00:11:21.379
But almost all of it can be read in terms
of this tension between public and private

00:11:21.379 --> 00:11:23.619
spaces and the ways people inhabit them.

00:11:23.619 --> 00:11:28.389
DuVernay brings Martin Luther King Jr. down
to earth, revealing his human struggles.

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:32.449
And then, in the last low-angle medium shot
of his speech in Montgomery, she returns King

00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:35.990
to his mythic status as one of the great American
leaders of the 20th century.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:41.509
While she hasn’t stuck directly to the historical
record, she has made an enduring and resonant

00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:43.309
portrait of an American hero.

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:47.240
Next time, we’ll turn back the clock to
tackle Where Are My Children, a much older

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.440
film that wrestles with some surprisingly
modern themes.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.720
