00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.040
Some movies are huge spectacles, with stunning
special effects and mythic characters who

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.790
hold the fate of the universe in their hands.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.559
On the other end of the spectrum are more
intimate films,

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.049
with complex characters navigating their everyday
lives.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
But just because the scale is smaller, it
doesn’t mean they’re any less powerful.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.320
Today we’re going to talk about one of those
movies, whose fresh subject matter, unique

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.080
structure, and well-crafted filmmaking made
it one of the most celebrated movies of 2016.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.340
It’s time to dive into Moonlight.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:44.420
[Intro Music]

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.860
Moonlight was loosely adapted from an unproduced

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.530
play by Tarell Alvin McCraney called In Moonlight
Black Boys Look Blue.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.940
And it marks the second feature film from
co-writer-director Barry Jenkins.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.970
His first feature was the 2009 romantic drama
Medicine for Melancholy.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.670
That film stars Wyatt Cenac and Tracey Heggins
as a pair of 20-something black Americans

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.120
after a one-night stand.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.390
It’s a rumination on identity, race, and
intimacy.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.410
For his second film, Jenkins chose to tell
a story that tackles similar themes, but with

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.710
a harder edge and more emotionally torn-up
characters.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.960
Centered around three pivotal moments in the
life of a young black American gay man, Moonlight

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.960
is as much about performed masculinity as
it is about growing up gay.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.341
And in both cases, it sets out to challenge
commonly held stereotypes of black men.

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:33.060
The film follows its protagonist Chiron from
boyhood through young adulthood in the dilapidated

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.100
housing projects of Liberty City in Miami.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.920
The first part follows Chiron as an extremely
withdrawn young boy, played with expressive

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.909
silence by Alex Hibbert.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.700
He comes into the orbit of a local drug dealer
named Juan, who briefly becomes a sort of

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.700
father figure.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.180
The second section of the film picks up the
story in high school.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.030
Chiron, now played by Ashton Sanders, has
become a lanky teenager, and is only moderately

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.520
less shy than before.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.380
His bullies have grown up too, and now seem
much more threatening.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.340
And in the third and final section of the
film we find Chiron in his mid-twenties, a

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.299
hulking mass of muscle.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.369
Played by Trevante Rhodes, the grown-up Chiron
has seemingly hardened, spent time behind

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.789
bars, and now works as a drug dealer in Atlanta.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.650
The filmmaking in Moonlight is extremely subjective
to Chiron’s experience.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.140
Jenkins doesn’t just tell his story, he
makes us feel it.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.870
Film is an incredibly effective medium for
exploring a character’s perspective, using

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.810
the same tools that create the illusion of
reality.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.590
This happens more directly when a film cuts
from a character’s face to a shot of what

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.590
they’re seeing.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.350
But it can be more subtle as well, using cuts
to flashes of a memory as it intrudes on the

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.870
present, or camera movements to emphasize
a character’s internal feelings.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.080
In Moonlight, Jenkins harnesses everything
from the shots and the mise-en-scene to the

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.940
editing and the sound to give us access to
his otherwise opaque main characters.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.160
Chiron needs protection and guidance, and
Juan, played with grace and moral heft by

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.640
Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali, steps into that
void.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.640
He really sees Chiron, without pity and
without judgement, and teaches him how to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.840
navigate everything from his own identity
to the bullies that terrorize him after school.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.460
In particular, there’s a moment when Juan
takes Chiron to the beach and beckons him

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.550
to come into the water.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.360
The camera stays with Chiron, holding on him,
pushing in as he decides what to do.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.840
In that hesitation, and that subtle camera
move, we understand the competing desires

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.700
in Chiron’s head — he wants to join Juan,
but is desperate not to make himself vulnerable.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.270
Once he’s in the water and Juan is teaching
him how to swim, the filmmaking turns subjective

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.599
again, jump-cutting between shots as Chiron
gets the hang of it and even begins to enjoy

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.599
himself.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.270
It’s almost as if he’s been freed from
the long takes, along with his hesitance.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.260
Jenkins is also underlining the fact that
Juan isn’t just teaching Chiron to swim,

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.480
he’s showing him how to take charge of himself,
how to keep himself afloat.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.900
Juan is giving him the confidence to trust,
to accept help, and to make human connections.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.120
There are ways to shoot the scene where it’s
simply a man teaching a boy to swim.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.940
But through subjective camerawork and editing,
the filmmakers also show us what it means

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.000
to the characters.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.709
In addition, the scene challenges several
stereotypes of black American men.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.830
First, Juan’s compassion is the opposite
of the harsh, violent depiction drug dealers

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.800
often get in mainstream films.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.730
And second, black Americans have historically
been systematically and disproportionately

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.730
not given opportunities to learn how to swim.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.940
As is so often the case in Moonlight, the
filmmakers are taking on more than one stereotype

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.940
at a time.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.479
Now, a film’s style can often be broken
down into two rough categories: realism and

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.479
formalism.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.449
Realism refers to a style in which cinematic
techniques like shots, cuts, mise-en-scene,

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.309
and sound are meant to be as unobtrusive as
possible.

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:33.620
The whole idea is that the filmmaking tools
go largely unnoticed by the audience, allowing

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.729
the story and characters to take center stage.

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.080
Formalism, on the other hand, is a style in
which those techniques clearly and deliberately

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.439
alter our perception of the film’s reality.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.349
Things like slow motion or reverse photography,
obvious manipulation of the film’s sound

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.710
or color scape, discontinuity editing, and
using jump cuts or repeated shots.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.129
These techniques all draw attention to themselves.

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:57.409
In formalist films, the form takes precedence
over the content.

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:01.940
Think about the wild, operatic camerawork
and editing of Martin Scorsese’s Raging Bull.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.600
Or the curated, almost caricatured worlds
created by Wes Anderson in films like Moonrise

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.629
Kingdom
or The Grand Budapest Hotel.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.849
While some films lean heavily into one style
or the other, most mainstream movies contain

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.280
elements of both.

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.710
And Moonlight is no exception.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.259
Jenkins captures much of Chiron’s experience
with realist techniques.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.770
Handheld shots follow Chiron as a young boy
as he runs away from his tormentors.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.119
Natural lighting fills the scene when Juan
finds him sitting outside his house.

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:30.439
The movie cuts traditionally back and forth
between a teenage Chiron and his mother Paula,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:34.689
fiercely portrayed by Naomi Harris, as she
demands money during her tragic downward spiral

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:35.840
into drug addiction.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.009
In these moments, Jenkins tries to keep the
filmmaking out of the way, to give us a sense

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.259
of being there in the room with the action
and watching it unfold.

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.469
But then – especially at pivotal emotional
moments – the film moves into a much more

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.520
aggressively formalist style.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:54.050
As a teenager, at least one other kid seems
to get Chiron and has known him for years.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.949
Kevin, played by Jharrel Jerome, presents
himself as confident and gregarious.

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:02.169
He’s as at home in his own body and persona
as Chiron is awkward in his.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.469
Chiron and Kevin share an intimate moment
one night on the same beach where, years earlier,

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.330
Juan had taught Chiron how to swim.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.189
Chiron opens up to Kevin for the first time,
and the scene turns intimate.

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.099
They kiss, and then Kevin takes things a step
further.

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.669
During this romantic encounter, the shots
become almost impressionistic.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.360
The camera captures their profiles and silhouettes,
leaned in close, Chiron’s head on Kevin’s

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360
shoulder.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.719
Chiron’s hand grips the sand, and Nicholas
Britell’s wondrous score takes over.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.889
Again, the movie is challenging how cinema
usually presents black American men, usually

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:33.620
macho or brutal — but not vulnerable.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.400
Here, Chiron and Kevin open up to one another,
sharing fears and hopes, and then engage in

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.300
a tender, sexual relationship.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.180
Back at school, one of the bullies taunts
Kevin into beating up Chiron to prove his

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.569
own masculinity.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.520
Afterwards, Chiron sits in an office, listening
to the principal lecture him.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.909
He cries, breaking for the first time, then
tunes her out.

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.210
The sound of her voice literally drops out
of the scene, and the camera moves low to

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.150
catch Chiron’s hardening glare as the sound
design ramps up in intensity.

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:29.469
In moments like these, Jenkins breaks the
realist tendency of his film, masterfully

00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:31.780
drawing us into his character’s heart and
mind.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.779
It’s an especially smart decision given
how interior the film is.

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:39.439
Jenkins uses many of the tricks of cinema
to help us understand Chiron’s constant

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:43.150
struggle to reconcile his identity with the
world around him.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.710
And it’s his struggle to be himself, a gay
black man in America, that drives the emotional

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:49.319
narrative of the film.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:53.240
Cinema scholar J. Ken Stuckey argues that,
“masculinity in its various forms is the

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.509
main antagonist of this film.

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.259
One of the most difficult aspects of being
gay is the way in which one’s sexuality

00:07:59.259 --> 00:08:02.819
can telegraph itself against one’s will,
even before puberty.”

00:08:02.819 --> 00:08:07.429
We see Chiron strive to fit in with other
boys his age, all playing a makeshift soccer

00:08:07.429 --> 00:08:08.729
game in the movie’s first part.

00:08:08.729 --> 00:08:12.360
The camera gives us Chiron’s point of view
as the boys stare at him – and therefore

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360
us!

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.969
We feel the weight of their eyes.

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:17.300
It’s off-putting, menacing even.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.800
In fact, among those boys it’s only Kevin
who truly sees Chiron as a person, rather

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.179
than some kind of “other” to be made fun
of.

00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:29.259
And when Kevin and Chiron wrestle on the ground,
Jenkins revels in their connection.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:32.600
The film takes its time with this moment,
giving us dislocated shots of their hands

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.779
and legs, bodies grappling with one another.

00:08:34.779 --> 00:08:37.550
They seem somehow both trapped and free.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.880
It’s a powerful visual metaphor for Chiron’s
central struggle — pushing and pulling against

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:45.580
the expectations of his community and the
stereotypes attached to his gender and sexual

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:46.580
identity.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.970
And it sets up what’s to come.

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:52.210
As an adult, in the third part of the film,
Chiron’s taken on so many signifiers of

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.340
traditional masculinity, he’s almost unrecognizable.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.560
In addition to his muscles, he wears gold
grills over his teeth, carries a gun, and

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.670
banters easily with one of his drug-dealing
underlings.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:05.920
He even has a miniature crown on his dashboard,
just like Juan had in the opening.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.901
Chiron visits Paula in rehab, where she begs
his forgiveness, blaming herself for the way

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.160
his life has turned out.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.200
Paula: But your heart ain't gotta be black like mine, baby.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.440
Paula: I love you, Chiron.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.200
Paula: I do.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.920
Then, after an out-of-the-blue phone call,
Chiron drives down to Miami to surprise Kevin

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.160
at the restaurant where he works.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.460
The two haven’t seen each other since their
altercation back in high school.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:41.120
Their conversation shifts in tone from awkward
to inquisitive to intimate and back again,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.490
as they catch up on the past decade.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:46.500
But more importantly, they’re re-negotiating
the terms of their relationship.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.880
Bit by bit, Chiron’s masculine posturing
falls away.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:53.900
He’s the same complex, vulnerable character
we’ve come to know throughout the film.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.750
And, once again, he breaks away from the stereotypical
black male that’s portrayed in lot of media.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:02.470
In the end, the two return to Kevin’s house,
where Chiron shares that he hasn’t been

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:04.720
touched by a man since that night on the beach
with Kevin.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.320
Chiron: You're the only man that's ever touched me.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:29.030
The film ends with an intimate scene — Chiron
cradled in Kevin’s arms — and a brief

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:33.270
shot of Chiron as a boy standing on the infamous
beach, looking back at us.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.760
And at himself.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:39.360
So there’s no denying that Barry Jenkins’
Moonlight is as thoughtful as it is elegant

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.360
and compassionate.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.260
You might appreciate it as an exquisite coming-of-age
story told in a unique way.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:48.320
Or as an exercise in how formalist cinematic
techniques can root us in a character’s

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.320
point of view.
