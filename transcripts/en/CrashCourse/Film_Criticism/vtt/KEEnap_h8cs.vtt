00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.240
[Ominous Music]

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.119
Well, here we are!

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.630
The last episode of Crash Course Film Criticism.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.540
So to round out this series, it’s time to
talk about a movie that’s known for being

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.660
both profound and timeless.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.760
Occasionally a film comes along that touches
something so deep within the collective human

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.540
experience that it seems to exist outside
of time.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.600
Often, these films dare us to see things in
new and unexpected ways.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.840
In 1968, a movie that’s arguably a modern
masterpiece was released.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.150
And it continues to reward multiple viewings
and interpretations five decades after it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.509
first hit the screen.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.240
It’s time to travel back to our old future,
with 2001: A Space Odyssey.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:35.840
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.400
2001: A Space Odyssey was dreamt up by director
Stanley Kubrick and science fiction writer

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.670
Arthur C. Clarke.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.819
On the heels of his savagely satirical nuclear
war comedy, Dr. Strangelove or: How I Stopped

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:50.909
Worrying and Learned to Love the Bomb, Kubrick
was eager to expand his canvas.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.159
He wanted to tackle a film that would burrow
deep into the viewer’s subconscious.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.999
He wanted to make a modern myth.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.359
Or as his collaborator put it, Kubrick hoped
“to create a work of art which would arouse

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.770
the emotions of wonder, awe ... [and] even,
if appropriate, terror".

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.300
Years before, Clarke had written a short story
called “The Sentinel,” about the discovery

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.930
of an alien object buried under the surface
of the moon millions of years ago.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.540
This “sentinel” acted as a kind of tripwire.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.620
Once humans had become technologically advanced
enough to discover it, the object would warn

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.400
distant aliens of our existence.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.390
From that idea, Kubrick saw an opportunity
to explore some of the most profound themes

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.200
in human history: the limits and consequences
of technology, the nature of existence, and

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.019
the evolution of humans — past, present,
and future.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.599
Working from an outline based on Clarke’s
short story, Kubrick and his co-writer developed

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.569
a screenplay and a novel simultaneously.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.190
They settled on an unconventional structure
that breaks the story into four distinct sections.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.140
The first, called “The Dawn of Man,” follows
a group of prehistoric man-apes as they struggle

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.349
to survive.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.300
They fight over food with plant-eating tapirs,
and spar over a watering hole with a rival

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.300
group.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.730
Then one day they discover a mysterious object.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.600
A tall, black, and perfectly rectangular slab
of… something, standing on the plains.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.810
A monolith.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.870
Soon after this meeting, the man-apes get
the idea to use broken bones as tools to hunt

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.562
with and weapons to fight and kill with, conquering
their hunger and their rivals.

00:03:09.562 --> 00:03:15.159
The chief man-ape then throws the bone into
the air and, as it rotates, the film cuts

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.959
to a shot of a spaceship mid-flight.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.370
The second section of the film, which has
no title card, follows Dr. Heywood Floyd,

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.519
played by William Sylvester, an American scientist
traveling to the moon.

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.959
Once Floyd arrives at the moon base, he reminds
his colleagues of the need for secrecy, and

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.130
then travels with them to a hidden crater…
where they’ve excavated another monolith,

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.640
buried eons ago under the lunar surface.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.099
Not long after Floyd approaches the slab and
touches it, the alien object emits a loud

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.739
and painful sound.

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.659
The tripwire has been activated.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.519
Then we move into the film’s third section,
titled “Jupiter Mission.”

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.909
It’s eighteen months later, and we’ve
swapped protagonists again.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.579
This part of the story follows a group of
astronauts and their supercomputer HAL – who

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.800
may or may not be sentient – on a long-distance
mission to Jupiter.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.909
Eventually we’ll learn there’s a connection
to the monolith on the moon, but the exact

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.500
nature of this mission is never explained.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.609
We follow two of the astronauts, Frank Poole,
played by Gary Lockwood, and Dave Bowman,

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.079
played by Kier Dullea, as they work
with HAL to oversee the space flight.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.040
Meanwhile, their scientist-colleagues hibernate
in little pod-beds.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.670
When Dave and Frank uncover what they think
may be a dangerous glitch in HAL, they secretly

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.310
plan to shut him down and continue the mission
on their own.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.970
But HAL finds out.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.990
He kills Frank and the sleeping scientists,
forcing Dave to make his way into the heart

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.850
of the ship and painstakingly destroy the
supercomputer.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.240
Finally, we reach section four.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.680
Dave’s ship arrives in Jupiter’s orbit,
where he discovers at least one more monolith

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.220
floating in space.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.419
After investigating, Dave finds himself whisked
away on a psychedelic, perhaps even inter-dimensional

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.110
journey through space and time.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.960
He ends up an old man in the most Kubrick
room ever built, with baroque furniture and

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.050
a glowing floor.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.810
And when he dies, Dave transcends the material
realm and becomes a now-iconic starbaby.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.470
The last shots of the film show the starbaby
returning to Earth and turning to the camera,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.720
before the film cuts to black.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.820
Whew!

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.699
Lots to chew on here.

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:08.590
One way critics have analyzed 2001 is to look
for patterns between the film’s four sections,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.080
to understand what the story could be trying
to tell us.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.450
The first clear pattern involves change, or
evolution.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.919
You might notice how many times birthdays
are referenced.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.341
The film begins with a section called the
“Dawn of Man,” basically “The Birth

00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:21.770
of Humans.”

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.520
Once we jump to our future on the moon, Heywood
Floyd calls his daughter to wish her a happy birthday.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.200
Heywood Floyd: Can't you think of anything else you want for your birthday?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.110
Then, once we’re aboard the Jupiter mission,
HAL discusses his “birth” as it were.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.800
Then, once we're on board the Jupiter Mission, Frank Poole gets a message from home

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.800
wishing him a happy birthday.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.680
Mrs. Poole: Happy birthday, darling.
Mr. Poole: Happy birthday, many happy returns!

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.960
And Hal discusses his birth, as it were.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:54.120
HAL: I became operational at the H.A.L. Plant in Urbana, IL on the 12th of January,  1992.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.880
Finally, when we reach the final room with
Dave Bowman, he turns into a newborn star-baby.

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.770
The film seems intensely interested in when
and how things evolve, as well as the consequences

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.470
those changes unleash.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.360
Technology clearly plays a vital role in the
progress of the film, too.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.740
It’s the man-ape’s discovery of simple
tools that paves the way for everything that

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.740
follows.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.440
This reading is underlined by one of the most
famous cuts in cinema history, when Kubrick

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.319
and his editor Ray Lovejoy cut from the man-ape’s
spinning bone-tool to the spacecraft flying

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:23.539
among the stars.

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:28.610
This single cut not only carries us tens of
thousands of years into the future, but implies

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.419
all the technological advancement of those
years – the wrong turns, the dead-ends,

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.539
and the triumphs
Kubrick seems to suggest that humans evolved

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.740
not just along with, but because of technology.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.750
And the monoliths present a question of technology,
too: Are they there to cause technological

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.900
leaps forward?

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.010
Or are they there to witness those leaps?

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.250
In Roger Ebert’s “Great Films” review,
he considers how the monolith could have affected

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.940
human evolution in this story.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.990
He says, “I have always felt that the smooth
artificial surfaces and right angles of the

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:03.509
monolith, which was obviously made by intelligent
beings, triggered the realization ... that

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:06.599
intelligence could be used to shape the objects
of the world.”

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:10.740
As we move into the second section, technology
surrounds the characters and carries them

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.740
into space.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.729
Kubrick stages elaborate set pieces depicting
space shuttles docking and space stations

00:07:15.729 --> 00:07:18.169
spinning to simulate Earth-like gravity.

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:23.020
And the deliberate pace of all of this stands
in stark contrast to the chaos of the man-ape

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.020
lives.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.050
To create these gorgeous sequences, both outside
and inside the spacecraft, Kubrick relied

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.750
on a mix of old and new cinematic technologies.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.159
Front projection and carefully crafted model
work created the space flight sequences, as

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.539
the ships dance among the stars to Johann
Strauss’s “Blue Danube.”

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:49.440
[Blue Danube Plays}

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.430
And to create the interior of the spinning
station, Kubrick commissioned a giant ferris

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.640
wheel-like set that would actually rotate,
letting characters appear to be walking or

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.069
jogging up the walls.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:02.990
Perhaps the most impressive aspect of all
this technology is that none of it is designed

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.659
to draw attention to itself.

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:08.199
Kubrick wasn’t interested in making a fantastical
space opera.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:13.800
Instead, his chief concern seems to be creating,
as closely as possible, the ways space travel

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.569
might actually happen.

00:08:15.569 --> 00:08:18.979
That was stranger and more fascinating than
anything he could invent.

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:22.610
Some people have criticized the film for being
overly interested in technology at the expense

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.100
of fully developed characters.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.100
And it’s true.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:28.520
We don’t learn much about the inner life
of Floyd or Dave or anyone else.

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.880
But as the American film scholar Carrol L.
Fry argues, that may be the point.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.570
In both the moon and “Jupiter Mission”
sections of the film, technology has outstripped

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.770
character relationships.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:41.910
Specifically, he writes, “The film repeatedly
invites us to see the contrast between the

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.800
sophistication of technology … and the banality
of human conversation.”

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.930
From Floyd’s empty dialogue with his daughter
and his bureaucratic pleasantries on the moon,

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.610
to most of the conversations between Dave
and Frank on the ship, spoken words reveal

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.440
very little about the characters.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.960
Woman: Now, are you sure you won't change your mind about that drink?

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.440
Heywood Floyd: Ya, I'm positive. Oh, I really must be going.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.600
Frank: Well, what do you think?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.280
Dave: I'm not sure, what do you think?

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.520
On the flip side, there’s so much time and
visual attention paid to the elaborate spaceship

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.310
docking procedures, their labyrinthine interiors,
and the panels of buttons, knobs, and computer

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.351
screens that control them.

00:09:17.351 --> 00:09:19.760
None of this is an accident on Kubrick’s
part.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.100
In fact, it builds his case that technological
advances might doom interpersonal relationships.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.329
Fry points out that the film’s most interesting
and complex character is the supercomputer

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:30.329
HAL.

00:09:30.329 --> 00:09:34.370
And HAL becomes the ultimate extension of
this anti-tech argument when he starts killing

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.350
the human characters on screen.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:40.410
This calls attention to another pattern within
the movie: territorial disputes that lead

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.410
to violence.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:45.390
Just like the man-ape killing its rival over
the watering hole, and Floyd politely sparring

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:48.960
with his Russian counterparts, here we get
a battle between Dave and HAL.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:56.320
Dave: Open the pod-bay doors, HAL.
HAL: I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.360
And when Dave finally succeeds in shutting
down HAL, the computer begs him to stop and

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.920
ultimately regresses to a more basic machine.

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:14.000
HAL: I'm afraid... I'm afraid, Dave.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.520
Kubrick seems to be saying that Dave has to
destroy this incredibly sophisticated computer

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:22.639
to move into the film’s final transcendent
section.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:27.170
And it’s this last section that invites
the widest variety of opinions and readings.

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:30.880
Bowman’s ship arrives at Jupiter to find
the planet perfectly in line with another

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.360
monolith and several other terrestrial bodies.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:37.600
The monolith, which is also a recurring pattern
in the film, is often presented as a solid

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.670
piece of material.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:39.810
A barrier.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:43.600
In the “Dawn of Man” section, Kubrick
holds a wide shot for several minutes as he

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.720
observes the man-apes tentatively approach
the monolith, until one dares to touch it.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.120
Once it’s deemed safe, they all crowd around
it.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.250
This image echoes the shot of Floyd and his
fellow scientists gathered around their

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.290
monolith for a photograph.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.839
In the film’s final section, however, Kubrick
presents the monolith as a kind of doorway.

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:03.420
And it’s through this doorway that Dave
begins his fantastical journey.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:08.149
The colors flash and strange landscapes whiz
by, intercut with shots of Dave’s face inside

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:11.250
his space suit, distorting as he travels through
the cosmos.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.690
As the images become more abstract, Kubrick
keeps cutting back to extreme close-ups of

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:18.480
Dave’s eye, grounding us in his point of
view.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.230
This is Dave’s experience, he seems to
remind us.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:26.060
And once Dave is in the baroque room and the
film cuts forward in time, toward his death,

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.019
each cut continues to pivot off Dave’s perception.

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:32.790
He looks into the room, and sees himself as
an old man with white hair.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:37.769
That older Dave hoists himself up and walks
over to look for the original Dave, but can’t

00:11:37.769 --> 00:11:38.769
find him.

00:11:38.769 --> 00:11:42.779
Then, when old Dave looks back into the room,
he sees a really old Dave lying in bed.

00:11:42.779 --> 00:11:46.820
That Dave looks past the foot of the bed
to see the monolith, once again appearing

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.030
as a kind of doorway.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:52.450
And then an interesting change happens: We
get the monolith’s point of view, looking

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:53.459
back at the bed.

00:11:53.459 --> 00:11:56.529
And we see a glowing ball of energy with some
kind of baby in it.

00:11:56.529 --> 00:12:00.410
This series of cuts seems to suggest that
Dave might have become the monolith, or

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:01.670
at least entered it.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.720
Whatever the case, humanity seems to have
been called to this room over the eons, through

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:09.839
time and space, so that we – through Dave
– might be reborn.

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:14.410
In the film’s last shot, as the Dave-star-baby
creature looms over Earth and turns toward

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:18.550
us, its eyes appear older, soulful and intelligent.

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:22.360
And as it looks right into the camera, it
seems aware of us.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:26.959
It also seems to have abandoned technology
altogether, able to travel vast distances

00:12:26.959 --> 00:12:30.360
without the need for pods, ships, or simulated
gravity.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.899
Technology may have been an essential part
of human evolution, but perhaps the only way

00:12:33.899 --> 00:12:39.360
we can move to this next level is by conquering
technology and letting it go… somehow.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.160
Whether we look at it as an examination of
the dangers of technology, or a thought experiment

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:47.709
centered on human evolution, there’s no
doubt that 2001: A Space Odyssey is a stunning

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:50.950
achievement of visual design and unconventional
storytelling.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:55.360
And on top of all that, it’s an engaging,
watchable film made by a director at the peak

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360
of his powers.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.610
Kubrick was able to use cinema to explore
some of the deepest questions facing humankind

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.960
— in ways only a movie can.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.640
I'm Michael Aranda, and this has been Crash Course Film Criticism.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:11.090
Crash Course Film Criticism is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
