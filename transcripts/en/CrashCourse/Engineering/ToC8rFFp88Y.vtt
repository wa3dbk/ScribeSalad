00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello again!

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.120
The last time I was here on Crash Course
we spent a year working our way through the
wonders of physics.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.880
I’m excited to be back again to talk about
something even dearer to my heart: engineering.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.340
Why am I excited?
Because I’m an engineer!

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.020
But what exactly is engineering?

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.180
A lot of things, actually.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.000
For now, we’ll just say that the history of
engineering encompasses

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.140
the creation of everything from the physical
objects around you to the processes allowing
you to watch this video right now.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.150
That’s like, really broad, I know.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.620
Don’t worry – we’ll talk about what
that means in a little more detail in our
first episode.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.000
There are actually multiple fields of
engineering and we’re going to spend some
time with each of them.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.620
We’ll explain the difference between and
the history of civil, mechanical, electrical,
and chemical engineering.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.200
And those four disciplines still don’t account
for all of engineering.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.200
But over the next year we’re going to try
to get to the heart of what all of that means.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.320
We’ll look at how engineers see problems
in the world and then try to solve them.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:06.170
That problem-solving mindset has helped
engineers create everything from spaceships to
coffee cups, wireless earbuds to dog whistles,
artificial hearts to roads and bridges.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.040
Before we do that, though, allow me to reintroduce
myself.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.680
I’m Dr. Shini Somara, and I started my science
career studying maths and physics at college.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.620
I then went on to study Mechanical engineering.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:25.320
And out of everything I learned during my first degree,
what fascinated me the most was fluid dynamics,
and understanding how gases and liquids flow.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.920
So I researched this topic at depth for 4.5
years, earning myself a Doctorate of Engineering
in the process.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.140
Since then I’ve worked as a science
communicator for the BBC, Al Jazeera
and even right here on Crash Course.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.600
I’m excited to be back to talk about something
that has meant the world to me.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.160
Over the next 46 episodes, we’re gonna get
a feel for how engineering and engineers have
shaped our world.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.620
I hope you’ll join me – and our friends
at PBS Digital Studios – on this journey
with Crash Course: Engineering.
