00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.140
Electricity powers our world.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:13.060
And we harness it through electrical engineering,
the field that focuses on the application of electricity
and electromagnetism in our everyday lives.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.620
Just as you have blood pumping through your
veins, machines and systems often need electrical
power flowing through their wires to work.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.300
It’s the lifeblood of our society.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.260
And it’s hard to imagine society today without three
of the main branches of electrical engineering:

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.500
telecommunications, power and lighting;
and computer engineering.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.200
They each came about in their own way, with
their own challenges and victories, their own
heroes and sometimes villains.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.760
And you’d be surprised how much death is
involved in the history of electrical engineering.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.820
Well, it can be dangerous.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:51.960
[Theme Music]

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.359
Electrical engineering deals with the properties
of electricity and magnetism.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.220
So it stands to reason that the field didn’t really
exist until we knew what those things were.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.020
No one had a very good understanding of electromagnetism

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:10.500
until English physicist William Gilbert released
his principal work, De Magnete, or “On the Magnet”,
back in 1600.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.900
After years of experimentation, he found that the needle
of a compass points north-south and dips downwards
because the Earth is basically a giant magnet.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.360
He was the first to describe the phenomena we now
associate with electrical attraction and magnetic poles,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.120
which is why many view him as
the father of electrical studies.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.400
Now, electrical conduction – which is the movement
of electrically charged particles through a transmission
medium –

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.180
wasn’t discovered until around 1729, by a
British scientist – Stephen Gray.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.360
He discovered it while doing experiments in which
he connected a glass tube to various objects, like an
ivory ball or a piece of cork, by wire or string.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.600
When he rubbed the glass tube, creating friction,
he found the object at the other end of the line
would be electrified.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.540
With the age of discovery and colonization upon
the world, could Gray’s work be used to produce
a faster means of communication?

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.160
This brings us to the start of the first field
of electrical engineering: telecommunication.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.780
Efforts to communicate over long distances,
by things like semaphore, were undertaken as
early as the 1700s.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.720
But it wasn’t until 1837 that Sir William
Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone
patented the first electric telegraph.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.180
Their design used five or six magnetic needles
to sway right or left to indicate specific letters.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.940
This early model was a little impractical
because of its cost, but the men later patented a
new version that only used one magnetic needle.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.840
Their invention was clearly a neat idea.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.820
But it didn’t really take off, until it was used to
solve a murder that sounds like it was lifted from
the pages of a Sherlock Holmes novel.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.060
On New Year’s Day 1845, a man named John Tawell
gave a woman he was seeing a fatal dose of poison.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.980
As the poison set in, she started to scream,
which alerted the neighbors.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.660
And Tawell ran off in a panic, thinking he
escaped the law as he boarded a train from
Slough to London.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.500
But his escape was foiled by technology.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.920
His description was sent by telegraph to London,
where Tawell was arrested and later tried and hanged.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.380
It’s a rather gruesome way to make an
invention popular, but it spread the story of
the electric telegraph nonetheless.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.880
Around the same time as all of this was happening,
Samuel Morse was making his own developments
in the United States.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.760
He figured out how to use an electromagnet
with a pen, so that when the electromagnet was
energized, the pen made a mark on paper.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:30.020
In 1838, he developed a system of dots and
dashes, now known as Morse code, so that
messages could be easily transmitted.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:37.060
By 1844, he had obtained financial support
from Congress and built the first telegraph
line in the United States.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.640
It travelled between Baltimore and Washington,
and on May 24th, he sent the line’s first message,
“What hath God wrought.”

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.920
Pretty ominous, if I do say so myself.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:56.380
About 20 years later, in 1866, the British ship
Great Eastern succeeded in laying the first permanent
telegraph line across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.220
Before it, large bodies of water were a big
obstacle for means of telecommunication.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:09.260
After the transatlantic telegraph line, some engineers
began to realize that by fluctuating an electric current,
they could induce different sound vibrations.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.940
It made them wonder, if they could 
manipulate sound vibrations,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.440
could they input a sound on one end of a telegraph
line and replicate the same sound on the other end?

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.360
Could they capture the human voice?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.120
By 1876, they did just that, with the invention
of the telephone.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.100
A few different minds came up with similar ideas
at the same time, but Alexander Graham Bell was
the first to get the patent.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:41.220
He was able to use a fluctuating current to vary the magnetism in the coil of an electromagnet, which caused a small piece of iron to vibrate on a diaphragm.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.560
This replicated the vibration that had initially sent
the fluctuation, which reproduced the initial sound.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:54.060
Now you could call talk to people who were
far away, but you still needed telephone lines and
a phone with a physical connection to them.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:59.620
But that changed when Heinrich Hertz discovered
electromagnetic waves around 1887.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.860
It was soon realized that these waves could
carry a signal by modifying their wavelength,
amplitude, and frequency.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.900
This led to the radio, and the never-ending
confusion over who gets credit for inventing it.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.860
Now, after World War I, electrical engineers
manipulated these signals and found that along with
the conversion of light to electrical impulses,

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.020
they could create a visual broadcast: television.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.040
Since then, we’ve taken these signals even
further.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.500
With the internet and wifi, we’ve developed
nearly instant, wireless communication around
the world.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.720
But electrical engineering is far more than
telecommunication.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.700
We have electrical engineering to thank for
supplying power and light.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.740
In 1801, Sir Humphry Davy discovered that he
could produce a brilliant spark, or arc, between
two carbon rods in a battery circuit.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.160
This is called arc lighting.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.280
Davy’s battery wasn’t powerful enough
to produce a stable arc.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.740
So arc lighting wasn’t commercially
feasible until the 1870’s,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.220
after Belgian-born engineer Zénobe-Théophile
Gramme developed a generator that could support
a higher power capacity.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.740
It was called the Gramme dynamo, a
continuous-current electrical generator that drove
the push for electrical power.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.920
While arc lighting began showing up on streets
around the world, Thomas Edison realized that arc
lighting was too bright to be used in the home.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.820
This led to his development of the incandescent
lamp.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.200
By capitalizing on the work of many others,

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:26.200
his incandescent lighting systems were soon featured
at popular exhibits such as the Paris Lighting Exhibition
in 1881 and the Crystal Palace in London.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.160
But Edison quickly gained competition, most notably
from George Westinghouse and Nikola Tesla.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.780
This led to what’s now remembered as the
War of Currents,

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:40.700
with Westinghouse and Tesla as proponents
of an alternating, or AC, current against Edison’s
direct, or DC, current.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.340
Edison did his best to discredit AC currents by
trying to convince the public they were dangerous.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:55.000
He had animals electrocuted by AC currents on
public display, and even recommended electrocution
as a death-penalty alternative to hanging prisoners.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.120
At which he succeeded.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:05.160
The first person to be executed by electricity was
a convicted murderer named William Kemmler, who
was put to death in the electric chair in 1890.

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.120
Despite his other efforts, though, Edison
failed to discredit the push for AC.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:18.020
Westinghouse won the contract to supply electricity to
the 1893 World’s fair in Chicago, and AC currents have
since become dominant in the electric power industry.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.800
We also have electrical engineering to thank for
many of the electronic devices we use every day.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.280
That brings us to the third field of electrical
engineering: computers.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.060
In their beginning, before World War II,
most computers were part of what was called
“radio engineering”.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.760
Most of the computer’s focus was on radar,
radio, and early television.

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.120
Their primary work was in processing the signals
of those devices.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.379
Computers only began to gain a broader audience
after the transistor was developed in 1947.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:51.600
The point-contact transistor was a semiconductor
device that could amplify or switch electrical signals.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.440
It allowed electrical engineers to replace
vacuum tubes, which were bulky, unstable,
and consumed too much power.

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.000
But while the computers could be smaller,
they were still pretty large.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.580
They also needed a separate integrated chip
for each one of their functions.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:10.220
Then, in 1968, American engineer Marcian Hoff
helped solve these problems.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:14.320
He conceived of a universal processor that
could be used by all computers.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.200
His work led to the Intel 4004, the world’s
first commercial microprocessor.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:23.820
Since microprocessors were so tiny, the computers
themselves could be even smaller.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:30.940
And, that’s how electrical engineers shaped the
world we live in today: with telecommunications,
electric power and lighting, and computers.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:39.620
The fact is, it takes all three of these fields – none
of which existed until a couple hundred years ago – to
work together, for you to watch me right now.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:48.360
So today we explored the history of each of these fields, touching on such topics as magnetism, electrical conduction, telegraphy, lighting, and computers.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.400
