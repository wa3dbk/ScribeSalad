00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.360
From imagining what it might be like to create
our own city, to learning about the chemicals that
go into our food,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.160
we’ve already covered a good amount of
engineering history.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.380
Civil, mechanical, electrical, and chemical
are the four main branches of engineering.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.840
But there are many others!

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.220
Some have been around for centuries, while
others have developed more recently and are
rapidly growing.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.160
Some have even broken off of existing branches
and are quickly becoming their own fields.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.480
One example of this is aerospace engineering,
which handles the design and construction of
air and spacecraft.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.640
This was a natural progression from
mechanical engineering, as we started
creating machines that could fly.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.280
Another example is environmental engineering,
which uses engineering practices, soil science, biology,
and chemistry to help find solutions to environmental problems.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.200
We’ll cover these and others in more detail later on,
but for now let’s focus on two of the more prominent
disciplines of engineering: industrial and biomedical.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.720
After we learn about the history of these two branches,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.140
we’re going to see what it would take to
use both of these fields to build and design
a fully-functioning artificial limb.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.600
So stick around!

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:11.360
[Theme Music]

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.940
Industrial engineering has been around as long
as we’ve had factories and other engineering systems.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.060
Just as mechanical engineers work with a bunch
of different parts to design a machine,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.060
industrial engineers work with many different
elements to devise an efficient system.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.460
And it’s not just the machines they have
to think about.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.620
They also have to consider the workers, materials,
energy flow, and communication that are needed to
provide the best product or service.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.840
Other branches of engineering often take apart
each system and analyze all of its parts separately,
before putting a system together.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320
But industrial engineers do things a bit differently.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.860
They look at the system as a whole first and
then move on to see how the different parts
work together.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.880
Then they can focus on the specifics to achieve
the best results.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.500
It’s all about optimization.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.600
And one of the most important areas that industrial
engineers try to optimize is the assembly line.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.460
It’s where we can see the biggest improvements
in quality, delivery time, and cost.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.320
The drive to optimize the assembly line is
why many factories have switched over to more
automation instead of manual labor.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.060
And it’s caused the idea of “lights-out manufacturing”
to grow,

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.800
which is where factories and manufacturing operations
don’t physically need humans there to run or operate.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.520
Some machines are far less concerned about
needing light, or heat and air conditioning,
for that matter.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.620
And they’re much less likely to complain.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.820
But we’re still a long wayfrom a world where
robots and machines run everything.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.640
Until then, we can learn a good deal from
Frederick Winslow Taylor,

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.660
an American engineer who we see as the father of
industrial engineering and scientific management.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.260
Around 1881, Taylor introduced what we know
as time study.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:49.720
He found that the efficiency in a shop or factory could be greatly improved by looking at the workers and eliminating as much wasted time as was reasonably possible.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:55.640
His work led to major improvements in factory
production by focusing on one of the biggest
variables: people.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.880
Taylor’s teachings soon became widespread,
with his work titled The Principles of Scientific
Management being published in 1911.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.340
While industrial engineering might not be as flashy
as some of the other professions, it’s central to the
overall function of the other branches.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.080
It’s the backbone of our engineering skelton.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.579
It’s been in the background of engineering
ever since we built the first factories.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.080
Which brings us to one of the new fields of
engineering: biomedical.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.460
It’s often used synonymously with bioengineering,
but the two are not exactly the same.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:31.880
Biomedical engineering applies engineering
skills and principles to biology and medicine,
usually for the purpose of healthcare.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:41.220
It focuses on human and animal biology, whereas
bioengineering is typically used as a broader term that
can include other biological systems, like plants.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:49.320
Biomedical engineering focuses on advancements
that improve our health, from diagnosis and analysis of
medical conditions, to their treatment and recovery.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.060
This is where we’ll learn the skills to
try and make an artificial limb.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.200
Biomedical engineers differ a bit from the other
disciplines in that they often need to apply modern
biological principles to their designs.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.960
For example, you have to make sure that the
materials of an artificial organ don’t cause an
unwanted reaction inside the body,

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.040
and that an artificial limb moves in similar
ways to its organic counterpart.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.139
As such, biomedical engineers need to have
a good working knowledge of many other fields

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.580
in addition to biology, including mechanical
and electrical engineering, materials science,
and chemistry, to name a few.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.800
And biomedical engineering shows up in most
of our lives.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.380
Beyond artificial limbs and organs, we have
it thank for defibrillators, pacemakers, MRI
and CT scans, and insulin pumps.

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.840
It’s striking to think that most of these technologies
weren't around 50 or 100 years ago.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.660
That’s because biomedical and bioengineering
didn’t really show up until after World War II.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.900
There were certainly biomedical inventions
before that, but they were mostly left to the
doctors and physicians.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:54.180
Some of the earliest evidence for the practice that
we’ve found has been a 3,000 year-old wooden and
leather prosthetic toe found on an Egyptian mummy.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:02.100
Moving forward to about 200 years ago, the
French physician René Laënnec came up with an
important biomedical invention: the stethoscope.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.740
After being appointed as a physician in the
Necker Hospital in Paris in 1816,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.880
he developed the stethoscope in response to
how uncomfortable it was to have to lay your ear on
a person’s chest to listen to their heart or lungs.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.080
People who enjoy their personal space have
been thankful ever since.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.060
X-ray imaging was another early biomedical
discovery.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.920
In 1895, German physicist Wilhelm Conrad
Röntgen discovered X-rays while experimenting
with electric current flow.

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.460
He took the first X-ray photographs, which
included the interiors of metal objects and
the bones of his wife’s hand.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.200
Even simple crutches and walking sticks can
be looked at as early biomedical devices.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.880
There was a medical problem, and people used what
they had available to them to improve their situation.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.660
But biomedical engineering didn’t really
take off until 1961,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.980
when the University of Pennsylvania offered the
Ph.D. Program of Biomedical Electronic Engineering,
the first in the United States.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:00.060
Now that the field was more established, one
of the biggest steps forward for biomedical
engineering was computers.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:08.020
With computers, we could begin to analyze data much
faster, which made it more efficient to evaluate patients,
and opened up new ways of doing so.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:16.660
Along with the invention of the internet, this is what’s allowed doctors and physicians to create a worldwide network of data to find medical patterns and correlations.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:22.680
It also led to new imaginingng opportunities
like the MRI and CT scans, which began to
pick up in the 1970’s.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.760
Moving forward, advancements in medical
instruments and electronics continue to be a
major goal of biomedical engineers.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.440
They continue to seek the answers to questions
like ‘How can we better take images of the body?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.660
Can we reduce any radiation involved?

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.620
Can we come up with better analysis and measurement
systems?

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.240
How many tests can we do from a single drop
of blood?’

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.880
But there are still some major challenges
that biomedical engineers are wrestling with.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.760
One of them is biological modeling.

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.650
We want to know – how we can simulate the
body and what’s happening inside it.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:57.120
If we can get a realistic and reliable simulation,
then we can use it to run experiments on rather
than using a real person.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.560
It would allow us to both experiment in ways
that could be harmful to a real person and also
repeat tests more than we normally could.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.760
Another area we’d like to learn more about
is drug delivery.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.740
We want the medicine that we create to get
where it needs to go.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.540
This is because certain medicine and treatments
become less effective depending on where and
how they’re delivered.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.780
It’s also important to know how the body
will react to any implanted biomachines.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.140
This is where materials science really comes
in.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.720
One of the more interesting recent developments
here is called cell encapsulation.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.600
This is where we surround a cell in biomaterials
so that it’s protected inside the body.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:36.480
The materials can act as barriers to protect
a transplanted cell from being attacked by its
host’s immune system.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.380
The technology is somewhat new, but it has the
potential to do wonders for cell-based therapy.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.000
Materials are also important as we develop
prosthetics even further.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.380
When we’re replacing something like a hip
or a limb, there are many potential issues that
we need to worry about.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:58.600
Some of these include making sure that bacteria and
infections won’t thrive on the material we’ve implanted
and that the material is durable and will last a long time.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.840
Let’s look at what it might take to replace
a fully-functional leg.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.240
There are many more factors at play than we’ll
go over for now, but let’s look at the big ones.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.880
To start off, strength of materials is going
to be pretty important.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:17.280
We need the mechanical “bones” of the leg to not
only last, but to handle both the static and dynamic
forces that a leg goes through.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:23.040
A material that handles the constant stress
and strain of standing might not hold up well
to the forces that happen when we run.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:28.640
Once that’s figured out, we’ll need to look
into power and electrical engineering if we
want it to move, like one of our legs.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.300
This is also where programming and computer
science might play a big role.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:35.899
Furthermore, it’s not just the strong, rigid
materials that we’ll have to worry about.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:42.740
For instance, our knees and many parts of
our bodies contain cartilage, which act, in
part, as shock absorbers.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.660
There are also fluids in our knees that help
them move, called synovial fluids.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:53.100
Finding out how to replicate these, with
things like hyaluronic acid, could go a long way
in recreating an artificial leg.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:09:00.080
Now, once we’ve figured out the design for the leg,
we’ll want to go back to our teachings about industrial
engineering in order to make them in a factory.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.720
Not only will it be good to make them efficiently,
but we’ll also want to make sure they’re made
with the best possible quality.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.980
You see, we have the potential to do great
things when we apply what we’ve learned.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.380
Like most engineering pursuits, things really
come together when we combine at least a few
of the different fields.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:21.740
So today we started off by learning about
industrial engineering and the different factors
involved in an industrial system.

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:28.060
We talked about Frederick Winslow Taylor,
the father of industrial engineering, and his
work with scientific management.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:33.440
Then we moved on to biomedical engineering and
bioengineering, along with their early inventions.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:42.260
Finally, we ended our lesson by talking about the future
of the biomedical field and saw what it might be like to
bring our teachings together in creating an artificial leg.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:47.620
Next time we’ll be moving on from our
history-based lessons into thermodynamic
and the laws of conservation.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:49.680
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you then.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:53.440
