00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.300
Thank you to CuriosityStream for supporting
PBS Digital Studios.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.100
Imagine that here, in front of me, is a box.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.179
But this is no ordinary box.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.050
It’s indestructible, could be any size,
and anything could be happening inside it.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.200
Maybe it’s making steel from iron.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.640
Or maybe it’s burning coal to generate electricity,
or creating compounds to be used in medicines.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.940
No matter what’s going on inside this
magical box, it’s our job as engineers to make
it the best most efficient box it can be.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.180
And to do that, we’ll need to rely on an
incredibly basic rule. A law, if you will.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.260
It’s called the Law of Conservation, and
it says that matter and energy can neither
be created nor destroyed.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.220
And we can use this law to figure out both,
where our box isn’t operating as efficiently
as it can be, and how to fix it.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:58.440
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.540
Whatever it’s doing, our box is what
engineers call a system, and what’s happening
inside it is a process.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.440
Everything beyond the box is known as the
surroundings.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.600
Let’s say you have an entire steel mill
inside this particular box, so the process
is converting iron to steel.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.140
Now, iron is expensive.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.060
Running steel mills is expensive.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.640
So if there’s something inefficient about
the way your box works, you’re going to want
to know about it – and fix it.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.160
Ideally, whatever you feed into the system
at the beginning, is what you get at the end.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.740
Input equals output.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.720
If your box is perfectly efficient,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.480
the law of conservation tells you that the amount
of steel you get at the end, should weigh exactly as
much as the ingredients you put in.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.400
So if you have 100 kilograms of iron and other
ingredients going into your box every hour, you’d
also have 100 kilograms of steel coming out.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.400
You know you’re not going to get 105 kilograms
of steel, because you can’t create 5 kilograms of
matter from nowhere.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.400
And you can’t have 95 kilograms at the end,
either, because everything you put into this perfect
version of the box is being turned into steel,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.080
and 5 kilograms of matter just
can’t disappear.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.340
If you’re running this system continuously,
with ingredients always flowing in and an equal
amount of steel always coming out,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.660
you have what’s called steady-state.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:19.060
When a system is steady-state, that means the
variables at the input and output remain constant,
despite what’s happening inside the system.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.860
It’s like water flowing through a full tank: if the
system is steady-state, water comes out at the
same rate it flows in, and the tank stays full.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.600
Of course, we’re just talking about what
would happen in an ideal situation – if the
box is perfectly efficient at steel-making.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.500
The thing is, the real world doesn’t usually
work that way.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.420
Engineers deal with systems that are way
more complex, and they’re not going to be
perfectly efficient.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.000
But you can use the law of conservation to
get a system as close to perfect as possible

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.880
– in other words, to get as much output
from your input, as you can.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.819
Before we go back to our steel mill, though,
let’s bake a cake.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.280
The pan will be our system, the oven will
be our surroundings, and the cake batter will
be our raw materials, or input.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.720
The cake itself will be our delicious output.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.170
Like most processes, we’re using this one
to make something we want – the cake.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.030
But, again like other processes, it’s probably
gonna produce some byproducts.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.920
When you burn coal to get electricity, for
example, you also get ash, sulfur oxides,
and nitrogen oxides.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.320
Steelmaking creates dust from zinc and
other metals, which is considered abrasive,
hazardous waste.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.040
And don’t even get me started on chemical
waste from manufacturing pharmaceuticals.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:30.960
Our cake will probably have some byproducts, too,
like if we burn some of the batter on the pan, creating
some charred bits that we wouldn’t want to eat.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.960
Look, not everyone’s a master chef.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.660
There are lots of other ways to end up with
leftovers, too.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.580
Sometimes you can’t get all of your raw materials to
react or turn into what you want – like if there’s some
batter in the pan that doesn’t get cooked.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.420
Some of the final product can also get stuck
in the system.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.800
Maybe some of the batter spilled onto the
oven racks.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.820
Any of these examples could be waste since
you couldn’t simply separate them back into their
initial parts to use them as input next time.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.760
There’s also the possibility our raw materials
were contaminated, which could easily end
up in our final product.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.260
When we cracked open the eggs, for example, some
small pieces of shell might have fallen into the batter,

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.100
which means we’ll probably still find them
when we try a slice of finished cake.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.320
You know, on second thought, maybe I’ll
pass.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.340
So, clearly our cake-baking process has a
lot of room for improvement.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.440
Engineers define problems like these in terms
of conversion and yield.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.300
Conversion describes how much of our initial
input was used in the process.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.120
If our system has a conversion rate of less than
100%, it means you’ll have some leftover or waste.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.520
Now that our cake is done, let’s go back
to the steel mill in a box.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.320
If you had 100 kilograms of iron and other
ingredients going in, and a 60% conversion rate,

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.420
that means you’d have 40 kilograms
of iron left over at the end of the process.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.260
That’s a lot of wasted iron!

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.760
Yield, meanwhile, describes how much of the final
product you were able to get from your initial input.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.860
So if your box has a 30% yield, 100 kilograms
of raw materials would get you 30 kilograms 
of steel, and 70 kilograms of waste.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.260
The most basic way to think about a system
is in terms of “balance”.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.040
Engineers measure the values that go in and the
values that come out, and if there’s a difference,
they’ll try to figure out what’s causing it.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.770
But conversion and yield only cover the beginning
and end of the process.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.540
Engineering, like life, is usually not that
simple.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.840
If you have a system that’s not in steady-state,
then you probably don’t have the same amount
of mass coming in and out.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.160
Real-life processes are messy, and stuff gets
stuck along the way.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.840
That’s accumulation, and as engineers, we can
use it to keep track of the differences between
what’s coming in and what’s going out.

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.720
The basic idea is pretty simple: if you subtract your
output from your input, you get your accumulation.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.760
If you’re measuring all this in terms of mass,
that simple equation is probably all you need.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.260
Mass goes in, and whatever mass doesn’t
come out at the end, is stuck inside the system.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.380
But when there are chemical reactions happening
inside the system – which there often are –

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.000
it can be more useful to think about accumulation
in terms of molecules.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.500
During a process, your raw materials might go
through a chemical reaction that generates some
molecules that don’t end up in your product.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.380
Or a reaction might consume some molecules
that are hanging around inside the system and
weren’t part of the input.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:13.180
To keep track of where all your molecules are, and
which of them are accumulating inside the system, you
need two more terms: generation and consumption.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.680
To calculate accumulation, you’d take your
input and subtract the output like usual.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.420
But then you’d also add the molecules being
generated within the system by chemical reactions,
and subtract any molecules being consumed.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.840
Whatever’s left over is what’s accumulated
inside the system.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.280
This equation is essential to engineering.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:36.740
Even in its simplest form, engineers can
use this equation to figure out how to improve
a system.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.720
So let’s see how we can improve ours!

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.240
The steel mill in our box has some raw materials
flowing in and steel flowing out.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.300
As engineers, our goal is to make as much
steel as possible at the end of the process.

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:52.379
Let’s say we begin with 100 kilograms of
raw materials with a 70% conversion rate,

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.180
which means we’re only making 70% of what’s
possible, or 70 kilograms of steel.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.820
Not bad, but not great.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:03.419
We’d be losing out on 30 kilograms of raw
materials, and probably a good bit of money!

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.700
This is where we’ll need to problem-solve
as an engineer and figure out how to make
the process better.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.160
How about a recycling system?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.780
We can introduce a separator at the end of
our system to sort out any leftovers.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.999
Then we can run that stream of unused raw
materials back into the beginning of our process.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.940
We already have 70 kilograms of steel and
30 kilograms of iron and other ingredients
that weren’t used.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.160
Let’s send those 30 kilograms back.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.800
Now, instead of 100 kilograms being fed into
the system, we have 100 kilograms plus the
leftovers from the previous cycle.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:38.320
So, even though we still have a 70% conversion
rate, we’re still getting more steel from the same
amount of raw material, than we were before.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.220
But what if our raw materials aren’t perfectly
clean?

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.719
What if we have contaminants?

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:48.120
Sometimes contaminants can lead to big problems,
literally ruining machines and halting production.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.870
It can be very serious and costly.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.640
For example, soda bottling plants have had
to shut down production because of possible
chlorine contamination.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:59.780
With our steelmaking example, let’s assume
the contaminants are relatively harmless and
won’t react with anything.

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:05.760
We’ll keep using our recycling system from
before, but now we’ll also need a ‘purge system’
to filter out the contaminants.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.540
If we don’t get rid of them, we’ll be passing
them back while adding new contaminants
during the next cycle.

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:14.940
As the contaminants build up, we’d run into more
and more problems with our machines and tools.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.180
Remember, just because we’re following the
Law of Conservation, or any other principles
of engineering for that matter,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.020
it doesn’t mean everything is working out
the way we want it to.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.660
As engineers, we’ll encounter limitations
like these and many others.

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:29.200
But with clever designs, we can work around
them.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:35.160
Engineering is all about testing our limits
and pushing them as far as we can until we
reach something truly extraordinary.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.260
So today we learned all about the law of conservation,
beginning with simple, steady-state systems.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:45.120
We then introduced the terms conversion and
yield, showing how they apply to a system.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.380
We ended with accumulation and covered how
generation and consumption can affect how
much accumulation there is in a system.

00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:57.670
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll learn
all about reversibility and irreversibility
and how they affect engineering.
