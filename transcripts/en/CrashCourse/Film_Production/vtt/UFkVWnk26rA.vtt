00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.170
Sometimes it’s impractical -- or physically
impossible -- to get the shot you want.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.950
Maybe the scene takes place on an imaginary
planet.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.820
Maybe the film is about a magical creature.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.370
Maybe the story requires action that would
be too dangerous to film in real life.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.529
That’s when filmmakers turn to special effects
and special effects makeup.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.880
If film is an illusion, special effects are
simply one more way to achieve or enhance

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880
that illusion.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.539
Whether it’s making Superman fly,
allowing Fred Astaire to dance on the ceiling,

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.529
or engineering a fight between Leonardo DiCaprio
and one angry bear,

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.470
vast teams of artists and craftspeople have
devoted their working lives to making the

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.650
impossible possible.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.560
Let’s feast our eyes on the world of special
effects.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:52.240
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.840
We think of special effects as a recent development,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.280
but it’s actually been around in some form
since the earliest days of cinema.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.379
Beginning with the trick films of Georges
Méliès, filmmakers have been using things

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.240
like double exposure, matte painting, tinting,
and creative cuts to create magic on screen.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.340
And they’re still at it!

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.829
James Cameron can take us to the bottom of
the sea – twice! – in The Abyss and Titanic.

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.560
Ridley Scott can immerse us in the neon-drenched
futuristic LA of Blade Runner.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.450
Films like Zodiac and Far from the Madding
Crowd can use special effects to transport

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.450
us into the past.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.219
And James Gunn can launch us into space with
a quip and a ship full of misfits in Guardians

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.219
of the Galaxy.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.079
But special effects can also be used in much
more subtle ways.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.409
Rather than draw attention to themselves,
these effects are meant to go undetected by

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.409
the audience.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.990
Citizen Kane, for instance, is not much less
fabricated than the original Star Wars.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.810
In fact, Orson Welles’ classic film was
a pioneer in visual effects,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.759
optically printing massive exterior shots, and featuring sophisticated

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.869
old age makeup – complete with cinema’s
first use of contact lenses to give characters

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.869
cataracts.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.929
More recently, dramas like 2010’s The Social
Network used computer-generated imagery, or

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.280
CGI, to complete city skylines and allow one
actor, Armie Hammer, to portray twins.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.700
In Stephen Soderbergh’s Oscar-winning 2001
film Traffic, CGI was even used to create

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.050
tears on a character’s face to enhance their
emotion.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.560
In fact, the vast majority of mainstream Hollywood
movies of the 21st century include at least

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.780
one shot that has been altered by special
effects technology.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.739
Special effects can be broken down into several
main types, which can be used on their own,

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.330
or combined to produce an image that meets
the needs of the film.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.350
Mechanical or Practical Effects are special
effects created on set.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.290
These include physical character creation,
puppetry, animatronics, and more.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.260
Think of the Cantina scene in the original
Star Wars film, before Lucas went in and

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.230
used computers to tinker with everything and
NO I’M STILL NOT OVER IT!

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.630
All those creatures were either puppets, animatronics,
or human actors wearing prosthetic makeup

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.730
or costumes.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.550
Pyrotechnics, like fires or explosions, also
fall under practical effects, along with wind,

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.190
rain, mist, snow, and smoke.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.650
In some cases, even running water constitutes
a practical effect.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.489
Unless the film is being shot in an actual
location, someone has to plumb the set if

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.550
you want water to run from the faucet.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.299
Optical Effects are created in the camera
as the film is being shot using optical instruments.

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.780
A lot of these techniques require extra equipment,
skills, and time, and nearly all of these

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.609
effects are now easier and faster to create
using computers.

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.629
Optical printing involves a combination of
the camera, a projector, and a special printer.

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:23.190
You begin by filming a live action scene,
matting out the section you want to replace.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.879
This is called the “garbage matte.”

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.450
Then you film a shot that you’d like to
use in place of the matted section.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.670
This is called a “plate”.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.640
Finally, you combine the two pieces of film
in an optical printer, and, voilà: special effect!!!

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.160
Compositing is a technique now commonly called
“blue screen” or “green screen.”

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.510
Originally, black screens were used.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.760
Actors would be filmed performing in front
of the screen, and then the black screen would

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.670
be replaced by a separately filmed background.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.200
The problem was, dark shadows also appeared
black.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.659
So any shadow on the actor’s clothing or
face would also be replaced by the background.

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:55.659
Not a good look.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:04:00.400
Color cinematography and beam-splitting cameras
allowed filmmakers to expose selective colors

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.029
on two or three different negatives.

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:05.930
Suddenly, it was possible to use a specific
color for the screen, one that would be much

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.519
easier to separate from the actors or their
costumes.

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.030
The first major use blue screens in a feature
film was the 1940 Technicolor spectacle The

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.450
Thief of Bagdad, which won Oscars for both
Cinematography and Special Effects.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.269
This technique continued to be refined until
blue screens were the norm into the 1970s

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.269
and ‘80s.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:26.210
Green screens have become more common since
the advent of digital cinematography, because

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.600
green is less present in human skin and hair, and digital cameras are more sensitive to it.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.560
Filmmakers use both blue and green today,
depending on the cameras being used and the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.389
costumes worn by the characters.

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.110
For instance, you might not want to shoot
Superman in front of a blue screen, because

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.101
it could make him look like nothing but a
floating head, hands, boots, undies, a big

00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:45.690
red “S” and a cape.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.500
Again, not a good look.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.520
Optical effects can also include scale models,
miniatures, and forced perspective props and sets.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.760
These techniques allowed Peter Jackson to
turn full-sized human beings into hobbits

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.699
and then have them interact with human characters
on the same set.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.360
Rotoscoping is an optical effect that involves
hand-tracing the subject of a shot, frame

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.030
by frame, so that it can be animated or more
meticulously matted into another shot.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.720
Stop motion, sometimes called Claymation,
involves shooting a model one still frame

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.110
at a time, moving it slightly between each
shot.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.750
The Imperial Walkers in The Empire Strikes
Back were created using this technique,

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.819
as well as animated films from Wallace and
Gromit

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.500
to The Fantastic Mr. Fox.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.639
Beginning in the 1970s, another weapon was
added to the special effects arsenal: computer-generated

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.180
imagery or “CGI.”

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.930
CGI covers everything from two-dimensional
animation to the fully realized 3D world of

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.020
something like Avatar.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.060
Basic rule of thumb is: if the effect is made
on a computer, it’s some sort of CGI.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.780
The first mainstream feature film to use CGI
was the original Westworld, directed by Michael

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.900
Crichton in 1973,
and its sequel Futureworld in 1976.

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.479
The effects themselves were quite simple – a
robot’s vision of our world, a 3D rendering

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.110
of a spinning hand – but they actually represented
an enormous step forward in the art and craft

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.319
of special effects.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.750
Nine years later, the very first photorealistic
CGI character appeared, in the film Young

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.729
Sherlock Holmes, in which a stained glass
window shatters and the shards come back together

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.979
to form an animated, sword-wielding knight.

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:14.349
This moment paved the way for major advances
in CGI character creation…,

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.360
from fantasy creatures like Gollum or
Groot, to recognizably human figures like

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.560
Benjamin Button or
the young Princess Leia at the end of Rogue One.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.069
Other aspects of CGI were equally revolutionary.

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:29.570
Digital compositing made combining various
images and image fields much quicker and easier.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:34.360
Keyframing, meanwhile, lets animators draw
a character or object once, and then set points

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.000
– or “keyframes” – to indicate how
the image should move over a given amount

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.120
of time.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.470
This saves artists from having to draw each
frame of an image separately.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.819
Now, what if your canvas as a special effects
artist is actually a person?

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.330
Artists who specialize in special effects
makeup are trained in the same skills as

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.160
traditional hair and makeup artists, and then
develop more specialized expertise in creating

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.629
things like injuries, old age, deformities,
and the creation of monsters, aliens, and

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:00.629
other creatures.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.319
One of the first filmmakers to excel at this
kind of special effects makeup was the actor

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:08.979
Lon Chaney, Sr. Nicknamed “The Man of a
Thousand Faces” for his ability to transform

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.310
into other characters,
he developed his own makeup techniques to

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.000
star in Silent Era horror classics like
1923’s The Hunchback of Notre Dame and

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.400
Rupert Julian’s adaptation of The Phantom
of the Opera.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.520
In the early days, major film studios had
their own “in house” effects teams.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.380
Then during the 1960s and 70s, the studios
scaled back, and those teams set up their

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.570
own special effects houses which were then
hired by the studios for specific projects.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:35.669
Today some of the most famous brand-names
in the business include Industrial Light and

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:38.220
Magic, founded by George Lucas in 1975;

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.620
Digital Domain, created in 1993 by filmmaker
James Cameron, along with master creature

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.720
creator Stan Winston and digital effects guru
Scott Ross;

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.189
and Peter Jackson’s WETA Digital, which
has created the effects-heavy drama Heavenly

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.650
Creatures, most of the Lord of the Rings saga,
and Avatar, among others.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.569
Now, whether it’s in-house or not, the special
effects team is most often overseen by a visual

00:07:57.569 --> 00:07:58.569
effects supervisor.

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.370
Their job is to ensure that the effects fit
the vision of the director and the needs of

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.910
the film, and that the effects are completed
on time and on budget.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:10.669
In order to accomplish this, they assemble
and work with a variety of special effects

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:15.840
artists, from digital matte painters and compositors,
to roto artists who specialize in rotoscoping,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.820
and lighting technical directors who work
as gaffers in the digital space, making sure

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:24.190
the direction, color, intensity, and mood
of the lighting matches the rest of the film.

00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:28.629
Pre-vis – or pre-visualization – artists
help filmmakers anticipate what an effect

00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:33.300
will look like when the film is complete,
and concept artists use illustrations to help

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:36.290
filmmakers design effects, creatures, and
environments.

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:41.530
Other artists specialize in rendering, animation,
weather design, enhancing explosions, combining

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.280
all the elements into a finished effect, and
on and on.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:48.580
Special effects is an ever-expanding field,
as new technologies emerge to make innovative

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.230
effects possible.

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:54.260
If you’ve ever watched the credits on an
effects-heavy film, you know they list hundreds

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.830
of names under special effects.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.130
All those artists spend their days working
to make the impossible possible, to wow us

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.890
with their imagery, and to enhance the illusion
of reality that is a film.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.330
Today we talked about the earliest days of
special effects, from the silent trick films

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.290
of Georges Méliès to the subtle work in
Citizen Kane.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.230
We broke down some of the the techniques used
to create special effects before computers

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.270
made it all so much faster and easier.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:21.150
And we looked at a few of the biggest special
effects companies and a just some of the jobs

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:24.160
available to special effects artists working
in film today.

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.520
And next time, we'll talk about who puts all of these filmed elements together to make the actual movie.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.280
The Editor.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.590
