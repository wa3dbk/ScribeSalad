00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.830
These days, you might turn on the TV and think
you’d been transported to a movie theater.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.840
Oscar-winning movie stars are all over television
shows,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.340
Directors known for big screen blockbusters,
like David Fincher and Martin Scorsese, have

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.010
found success working in television.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.090
And the advent of streaming services and premium
cable networks have expanded not only how

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.980
we watch shows, but also the kinds of shows
that get produced.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.320
Edgier content that used to be reserved for
feature films is now being explored every

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.320
day on TV.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.470
As the line between cinema and television
continues to blur, no discussion of film production

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.300
would be complete without tackling the TV
landscape and how television production has

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.720
come to look a lot like making movies.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:49.120
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.860
Television includes a huge variety of content that can be broken down into a bunch of different
categories, from prestige dramas and traditional

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.430
sitcoms, to infomercials, soap operas, and
24-hour news networks.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.520
One of the most basic ways to categorize TV
shows is to divide up scripted and unscripted

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.520
content.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.329
Scripted TV simply means there was a script
written for the show.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.460
So that’s everything from Game of Thrones
and Empire to Family Ties and Quantum Leap.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.980
Unscripted TV is – you guessed it – any
show made without a script.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.040
This can include reality TV, like The Bachelor
or House Hunters, as well as sports games,

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.329
awards shows, and cable news.

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.899
Today we’ll talk about scripted TV, since
that’s closest to film.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.740
We’re also going to focus on television
in the United States.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.719
We’d be here all day if we dove into how
other countries produce and monetize TV shows!

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.599
Now, television can also be broken down in
terms of how it’s delivered to the audience,

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.799
which has a major impact in how the money
is made and what shows make it onto the air.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.420
The four main kinds of contemporary TV networks
are broadcast networks, basic cable, premium

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.099
cable, and streaming services.

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.189
Today, there are five major broadcast networks
in the United States: NBC, CBS, ABC, Fox,

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.140
and The CW.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.799
There are a handful of other ones, like PBS, which offer

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.229
more specialized programming and operate under
different economic models.

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.669
But these five major broadcast networks make
most of their money through on-air advertising

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:06.439
– things like restaurant commercials, pharmaceutical
ads, or geckos selling you car insurance.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.619
So broadcast networks want to reach as many
eyeballs as possible, by making their shows

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.619
widely appealing.

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:16.070
A season is traditionally a year’s worth
of episodes – often 22 for broadcast network

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.010
dramas and sitcoms, and more like 8 to 12
on cable.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.790
And if networks cram more episodes into each
season, they can sell more commercial blocks.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.420
Which is why NCIS runs for 22 episodes a season
on CBS, and has since 2003!

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.701
The more people watching a network’s shows,
the more money advertisers will pay, which

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.450
is why ratings matter to broadcast networks.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.730
Ratings are a measurement of how many viewers
watch each episode of television.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.400
In the United States, the Nielsen Research
Media rating system has become the industry

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.079
standard for figuring out how popular a show
is.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.670
Nielsen ratings rely on complex statistical
sampling, the same technique used for predicting

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.340
the outcome of political elections.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.409
The Nielsen team monitors the TV viewing habits
of a sample of American households, and then

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.739
extrapolates from those numbers to arrive
at a rating for each episode.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.680
Among the various problems with this system,
the sample size is really small.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.370
Something like 5,000 households are used to
determine the entire nation’s viewing habits.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.840
Also, the advent of DVRs has made collecting
reliable viewership data trickier, because

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.230
lots of people record shows and watch them
later.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.530
Officially, Nielsen Research Media counts
DVR numbers in a show’s rating if the episode

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.569
is watched within one week of the original
air date.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.879
But if you save up every episode of American
Horror Story to marathon in one terrifying

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.260
sitting, that doesn’t count.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.439
Even with these flaws, broadcast networks
continue to use Nielsen ratings to decide

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:30.689
which shows get renewed and which get the
ax.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.400
Basic cable networks operate similarly, but
don’t have as much pressure to reach a massive

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
audience.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.540
These include all the channels you get with
the standard package from your cable company,

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.910
like TNT, USA, AMC, the Disney Channel, the
History Channel, and Sy-Fy…

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.249
Plus all those other channels you zip past
to get to your favorites.

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.060
Basic cable networks make money through on-air
advertising, like broadcast networks.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.480
But they also charge a carriage fee to the
cable company that “carries” the network

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480
into your home.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.140
That means that basic cable shows can appeal
to a more niche audience, and still make a

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140
profit.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.930
Especially if that audience is likely to spend
money on high-end and luxury products.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.859
So Mad Men was a hit for AMC, even though
only 2 million people watched it each week,

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:11.439
while each episode of The Big Bang Theory
reaches almost 20 million people for CBS.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.109
Premium cable networks, like HBO, Showtime,
and Starz, abandon on-air advertising altogether,

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.039
and rely largely on monthly fees paid by each
viewing household for income.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:24.220
So ratings matter much less for these channels,
and they measure success in other ways.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.720
Game of Thrones and Girls aren’t expected
to draw 15 million viewers each week.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.780
Instead, HBO hopes lopped-off heads and hilarious
20-somethings will create enough cultural

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.650
excitement that more people sign up for the
network.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.789
Streaming services that produce original content,
like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, also

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.139
rely on a subscription model.

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.320
A show like Transparent is a hit because it
makes more people pay for Amazon Prime, not

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.660
because it can compete with Quantico for viewers.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.340
All these different kinds of networks matter
because they affect which shows get made,

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.980
how they’re produced, and what subject matter
they can tackle!

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.051
Since broadcast network shows need to appeal
to a wide audience to make money, premium

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:04.099
cable and streaming series can tell more challenging
stories with higher levels of sexuality, violence,

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.099
and harsh language.

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.610
That doesn’t make premium cable shows better,
but it certainly makes them different!

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.169
And just like film distribution went through
big changes after home video, video-on-demand,

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.220
and now streaming services, TV networks have
many ways to get their shows to an audience.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.840
The old broadcast model used to rely on first-run
episodes followed by re-runs, where the network

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.270
would air old episodes of their own shows
later in the week or over the summer.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.000
If a show was successful enough to run a hundred
episodes or so, it might be sold into syndication.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.800
This is where the studio that actually made
the show starts licensing the existing seasons

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.750
directly to local TV affiliates.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.479
These days, premium cable series sometimes
make the syndication leap to basic cable networks,

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.629
like when A&amp;E bought the rights to air a slightly
tamer edit of The Sopranos, which originally

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:45.629
aired on HBO.

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.050
Premium cable channels like HBO and Showtime
have set up their own streaming services too.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.970
That way, they can keep sole ownership of
their content and sometimes bypass cable companies

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.970
altogether.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.360
Now, in many ways, producing scripted television
and making feature films are remarkably similar.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.483
Writers write scripts, producers assemble
crews of cinematographers, gaffers, costume

00:06:02.483 --> 00:06:04.930
designers, and so on, directors oversee the
shooting of the scenes, and editors cut them

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:05.930
together.

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.889
In other ways, they’re fundamentally different.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.729
Most obviously, TV series are way longer.

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:14.849
A show might run anywhere from 6 episodes
per season on premium cable, to a whopping

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.729
22 episodes per season on a broadcast network.

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.490
And super successful shows like Friends or
Grey’s Anatomy might keep airing for more

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.490
than a decade.

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.069
That’s a lot of story, which means a lot
of scripts, locations, characters, and shooting

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:30.539
days, which means more writers, producers,
actors, and crew.

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:31.710
And longer shooting schedules.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.919
If film shoots are grueling, shooting a TV
series can be a full-on marathon!

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:41.080
Also, unlike feature films, the main creative
decision-maker on a TV series is a writer-producer

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.370
called a showrunner.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.920
Very often, the showrunner is also the creator
of the series and the sole writer of the show’s

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.550
pilot, a test episode that helps the network
choose which series to make.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.629
Showrunners can oversee everything from the
story direction and writing, to hiring directors,

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:56.360
and even editing the series.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.240
Most shows have a writers room, where a group
of writers gather to outline and write the

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
series’ episodes.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240
On broadcast network shows, the writers room
may have as many as 15 or 20 people.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.900
But for cable series, the writers room is
often much smaller.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.409
One season of Game of Thrones is regularly
written by only three or four people.

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:11.590
And on rare occasions, a single writer may
be responsible for an entire season.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.750
Michael Hirst writes every episode of Vikings.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.750
And Nic Pizzolatto wrote the first two seasons
of True Detective.

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.520
When it comes time to film the show, most
series divide their episodes among a number

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.789
of different directors.

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:25.340
Usually, the director of the pilot helps set
the look and feel of the series, and stays

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.360
involved as a producer to make sure future
episodes remain true to the original vision.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.159
On occasion, a season of a premium cable or
streaming series might all be directed by

00:07:33.159 --> 00:07:34.389
one person.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.089
Cary Fukunaga directed all eight episodes
of True Detective season one, giving that

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:41.150
story a cohesive quality that’s unusual
on television.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.860
For actors, working on a TV series can be
a major commitment.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.289
Most series are designed to last for several
seasons, so an actor might spend years playing

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:50.289
the same part.

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:53.819
That’s great for job security – something
many actors struggle with – but it can also

00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:56.280
make an actor feel trapped in a role or a
show.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.669
While film franchises do have recurring characters,
like Harry Potter, James Bond, or any of those

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:04.259
Fast and Furious drivers, they’re the exception
rather than the rule.

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.629
More and more, TV series are being produced
like feature films.

00:08:07.629 --> 00:08:11.569
This is especially true for single-camera
shows – everything from comedies like Atlanta

00:08:11.569 --> 00:08:16.360
or Master of None to mysteries like Castle,
sci-fi epics like The Expanse, or realistic

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.000
dramas like Friday Night Lights.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.169
They look and feel like movies, as though
each scene is happening in an actual location

00:08:22.169 --> 00:08:23.729
within the world of the story.

00:08:23.729 --> 00:08:27.139
They also allow for more control over the
shooting and editing of the show.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:30.669
Three-camera shows, on the other hand, are
about as far away from feature films as scripted

00:08:30.669 --> 00:08:31.669
TV gets!

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:35.390
They’re almost always sitcoms, and often
performed on a stage in front of a “live”

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:36.390
studio audience.

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.780
Think of Cheers or The Big Bang Theory.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.950
These shows look more artificial because…
well... they clearly are.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:46.380
Multiple cameras capture the action, the sets
are designed to only be shot from one direction,

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.440
and the editing mixes mostly wide shots with
pre-recorded or enhanced laugh tracks.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.840
They can be hysterically funny, but they don’t
seem that real.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.470
Across different types of productions, more
actors, directors, writers, producers, and

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.910
crew members are working in both TV and
film.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:07.030
We even have universes that crossover, thanks
to Marvel, and limited TV series like HBO’s

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:09.310
Big Little Lies that feel like extended movies.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:13.840
It’s an exciting time to be involved in
both movies and TV, as an artist and a viewer,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.460
where the only downside is there’s not enough
time to see it all!

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.290
Today we talked about the difference between
broadcast and cable networks, and how new

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.440
streaming services are changing the definition
of television.

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.730
We looked at how ratings impact what shows
make it to air, and how the subscriber model

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:31.810
of premium cable and the streaming services
allow them to make edgier shows.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:35.650
And we discussed how TV shows are actually
made, from the power of the showrunner to

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.090
the difference between single camera and 3-camera
shows.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.070
Next time, we’ll switch gears and start
watching and thinking critically about films

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.400
together, starting with Citizen Kane.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.630
