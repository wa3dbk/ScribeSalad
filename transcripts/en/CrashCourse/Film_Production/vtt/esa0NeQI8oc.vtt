00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.060
A movie, as you know, is basically a sequence
of shots.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.490
The shots themselves may be beautiful or strange,
kinetic or still, bright or dark.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.099
And, viewed individually, they might carry
some meaning.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.140
But the real power of narrative cinema comes
when you put those shots together.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.480
Suddenly they have context.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.850
They react to one another, surprising us or
putting us at ease.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.779
Cut together, these shots can create whole
new levels of meaning and evoke emotions in

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.100
ways only cinema can.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.830
And the person whose job it is to make those
cuts, to discover that emotional and narrative

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.220
alchemy, is… the editor.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:46.280
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.460
Like cinematographers, production designers,
costumers, and makeup artists, editors must

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.070
be part technician, part craftsperson, and
part creative artist.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.780
They are responsible for understanding the
technology of post-production, from editing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.940
software to integrating sound design, music,
and special effects.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.650
But they also need to have a deep understanding
of film grammar, a gut instinct for character,

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.930
and a powerful sense of timing.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.060
They are the final guardians of the story
and the emotional landscape of the film.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.780
A narrative film is a very fragile thing,
and one misplaced cut can drastically change

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
its meaning and impact.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.610
But as crucial as it is, the editor’s job
is also to hide their work.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.030
Usually, their goal is to make the cuts appear
so seamless that the audience doesn’t even

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.030
notice them at all.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.520
Like so many great artists, the best editors
make their work look effortless.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.900
But trust me, it’s not!

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.930
Among their duties, editors must be able to
sort through hours and hours of raw footage

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.570
to find the story.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.590
They must train their visual memories to remember
tiny differences between takes and shots,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.160
and imagine how they might be cut together.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.370
They must help the director separate the movie
they wanted to make, from the movie they

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.390
actually shot.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.281
They are fresh eyes, unencumbered by the challenges
of getting a shot or the heartbreak of a performance

00:01:50.281 --> 00:01:51.281
that didn’t turn out.

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:55.530
Editors must also have the taste to recognize
when the story isn’t working, and the skills

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.630
and experience to offer some solutions.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.000
Another way to think of this is that editors
are the first audience for a film.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.220
An audience with the power to change it and
make it even better.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.220
So how do they do it?

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.390
In the beginning, editors worked with razor
blades and tape to physically slice the film

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.240
into shots and then join those shots together.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.140
It was painstaking work.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.580
One cut could take several minutes, as opposed
to the seconds it takes today using editing software.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.800
It was also more difficult to experiment with
various cuts.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.990
There was no easy, quick way to go back and
undo a particular edit.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.870
Just more razor blades, tape, and time.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.610
An editing machine called a Moviola became
standard equipment for editors in the 1920s,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.700
and not a moment too soon!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.120
In addition to streamlining the process, the
Movila allowed editors to watch the film as

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.480
they were making their cuts.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.760
Then in the 1970s, flatbed editing systems
like the Steenbeck and the KEM arrived.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.920
Now editors could move the film backward and
forward to examine their edits, and listen

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.090
to the recorded soundtrack as they went.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.280
Flatbeds would remain the industry standard
until the 1990s, when digital editing systems

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.530
like the Avid emerged.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.980
We refer to physical film editing as linear
editing, because the process involves editing

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.590
your way through the scene or the film in
sequence, shot by shot, and choosing cut points

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.590
as you go.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.540
It’s also called destructive editing, since
the editor is literally cutting the film,

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.260
irreparably altering it with each transition
between shots.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.720
When you edit digitally using computer software,
that process is called non-linear editing.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.790
Here, you can scroll to any point in the scene,
or in the film, with the touch of a button,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.730
joining and re-joining shots in any order,
as many times as you want.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.510
It’s also called non-destructive editing.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.780
The main non-linear editing systems include
the Avid, Apple’s Final Cut Pro, and Adobe Premiere.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.940
Each system has its benefits and drawbacks,
and each editor must figure out what works

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.490
best for each project in terms of budget,
workflow, and ease of use.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.129
Now, when the footage comes in from the set,
the editor’s first step is to create an

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.129
assembly cut.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.790
This is a very rough version of the movie
that cuts each scene together in its most

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.790
basic form.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.090
They’re often very long and sometimes contain
multiple takes of a given shot.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.480
The goal of the assembly cut is for the director
and editor to see if they’ve captured the story.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.560
Are there any major plot points missing?

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.260
Can the desired tone be achieved with the
footage that they have?

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.319
Are there any technical problems with the
footage?

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.220
Do the characters make sense?

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.370
Where are the plot holes?

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.410
Watching an assembly cut for the first time
is often both a joyful and painful experience.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.610
There’s your film, all put together, coming
alive for the first time before your eyes.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.239
But it’s also usually a Frankenstein’s
monster of dead-ends, missed shots, and performances

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.049
that haven’t been properly paced yet!

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.049
But don’t panic!

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.049
Because there’s more work to do!

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.800
The next step in the process is to make a
rough cut, or several of them.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.990
This is the time for experimentation, for
re-thinking the structure of the film.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.469
What if this scene goes here?

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:28.469
What if we move this line to the next scene?

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:31.099
Do we even need this this subplot, or this
moment, or this shot?

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.939
How can we build the tension, liven a flat
scene, or make a joke funnier?

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:39.009
The editor uses rough cuts to focus on the
bigger parts of the movie that aren’t working.

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.589
It’s also where the filmmakers can begin
to get a sense of what the ultimate run time

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:43.620
of the movie will be.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.949
Once those issues have been solved, the editor
moves on to the fine cut.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.830
At this point, the issues are smaller, but
no less significant.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.700
It’s time to fine tune performances, maximize
emotional impact, trim some shots, and extend others.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.260
This is where you ask: When do we cut from
one character or another?

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.930
Is it better to extend this shot by one frame?

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.069
Two frames?

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.069
Five?

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.520
How can we hide our crappy, animatronic shark?

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.600
Two frames can make the difference between Jaws and Sharknado.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.000
Then we come to the final cut.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:14.710
At this point we are achieving a “locked
cut,” meaning no more changes to the duration

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.479
or order of any shot in the film.

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.349
Color correction is happening.

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:19.830
Visual and sound effects are coming in.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.779
Music is being composed, recorded, and selected.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.259
ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, is
being recorded and added to the film.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.979
And it’s all being mixed so that every image
and sound in the film exists in proper balance,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.540
fulfilling the vision of the director, who’s
now working through the editor and

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.480
the post-production team.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.020
Each step in this process is specific and
important, but not necessarily distinct.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.259
Every film is different, so often these stages
blend into one another.

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.470
The editor might have a brilliant re-structuring
idea in the fine cut stage, and open the film

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.939
back up to re-arrange some scenes.

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:54.469
Or the director might have a sudden desire
to extend a pivotal emotional beat just as

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.629
the film is locking picture.

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:58.940
However it happens, once all these steps are
complete, so is the movie.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.740
And at every step in this process, the editor
makes an indelible mark on the project … even

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:05.069
if it’s not always obvious.

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.749
One of the most powerful effects of the editor’s
work is the ability to shift a film’s perspective.

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:14.400
Who the film cuts to, at what moment, and
how long it remains on a character can influence

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.990
the audience’s identification with a character
and their experience.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.620
Editors spend a lot of time asking questions
like, “Whose scene is this?” and “Why?”

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.779
Usually followed by, “Does it have to
be that way?” and “What if we tried it

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:27.110
from another point of view?”

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.719
Very often the director is in the room for
these conversations, and if they can be open

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:34.919
to it, an editor’s ideas can sometimes change
the way they think of the film, opening up

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.430
new and exciting possibilities.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.069
The more films you make, the more you realize
that you can’t separate shooting and editing.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:41.279
They’re bound together.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:45.240
The shots inform the editing and allow for
all the experimentation that is to come.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.869
Cinematographers spend a lot of their own
prep time thinking and talking about how their

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.009
shots might get cut together.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.659
It’s all designed to tell the story and
evoke the desired emotions.

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.110
And so much of it comes down to when to
cut.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.139
And how the rhythm of those cuts contributes
to the emotional and narrative experience

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:01.139
of the story.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.760
The best editors collaborate very closely
with directors and bring out the best in their work.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.080
The great Thelma Schoonmaker has been editing
Martin Scorsese films since the earliest days

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:14.120
of his career, from the split-second cuts
of Raging Bull to the contemplative stillness

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.189
of Silence.

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:20.160
Stephen Spielberg has worked with editor Michael
Kahn ever since Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.659
Quentin Tarantino has long praised the late
Sally Menke for corralling his impulses and

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:28.229
bringing order to his films, from Reservoir
Dogs to Inglorious Basterds.

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:30.720
Walter Murch is one of the editing greats.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.169
He’s cut everything from Apocalypse Now
and The Godfather to The English Patient.

00:07:34.169 --> 00:07:38.759
He was among the first old-guard editors to
switch to a non-linear editing system, and

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.250
he wrote the book on film editing, called
In the Blink of an Eye.

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.639
In it, he lays out his six priorities for
cutting away from one shot to another.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.389
The first is emotion.

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:50.849
How does the shot affect the audience emotionally?

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:52.169
What do you want them to feel?

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.720
And does a cut add to that emotion, or take
away from it?

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.439
The second is story.

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:05.499
Does the cut move the story forward?

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.320
Each cut needs to advance the story, not bog
it down.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.920
Murch’s third priority is rhythm.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:34.100
Just like music, he believes editing must
have a beat, a rhythm, a sense of phrasing.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.070
Is a cut interesting here, or dull?

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:37.770
What does it do to the pacing of a scene?

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:38.770
Shake it up?

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:39.600
Or flatten it?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.100
Fourth is something he calls eye trace.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.080
How does the cut affect where the audience
focuses in the frame?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.520
The editor should be aware of where they want
the audience to be looking, and then use that

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.680
to surprise or confirm their instincts, depending
on what the scene is trying to accomplish.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:25.640
The last two priorities charge the editor
with being aware of both the two dimensional

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:28.910
place of the screen as well as three dimensional
space.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:33.180
These are fancy ways of saying the cut has
the power to maintain or disorient the audience

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.160
as to the physical space within the scene.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.330
All told, the editor should be conscious of
how the cut affects the audience’s understanding

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.480
of the world of the film.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.920
Editors are as vital to the filmmaking process
as they are low profile.

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:04.130
By the time the film is screening in a theater,
no one knows the footage, the emotional beats,

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.000
the pacing, and the performances better than
the editor.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.060
Without them, we’d just have a pile of random
footage.

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.880
With them, we have magic.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.240
Today we talked about the job of the editor,
as both a technician and an artist.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.700
We learned about the history of film editing,
from hand-cutting film to using digital editing software.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.880
And we explored the impact of the choices
an editor makes in collaboration with the

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.860
director, and how those cuts can bring a film
to life.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:32.870
Next time we’ll explore marketing, the surprisingly
creative work done after the film is edited,

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:35.770
as distributors try to pitch the film to its
intended audience.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.060
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.561
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:47.840
PBS Infinite Series, PBS Space Time, and It’s
Okay to be Smart.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.780
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.360
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
