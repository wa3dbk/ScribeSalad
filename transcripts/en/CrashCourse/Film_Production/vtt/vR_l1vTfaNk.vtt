00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:05.390
Movies are made up of series of images.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.390
Some are beautiful, some are harsh, and some
stick in our minds forever.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.040
Like the gently rolling spaceships in 2001
A Space Odyssey.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.170
Or Peter O’Toole riding out of the desert
in Lawrence of Arabia.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.080
Or Darth Vader emerging from the smoke in
Star Wars.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.289
But who actually takes these pictures?

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.089
If the director is the one who sets the vision
for the film, whose job is it to bring that

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.089
vision to life?

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.230
That’s the person who puts the pictures
in motion pictures.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.240
The cinematographer.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:42.380
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.120
Cinematographers must be artists, engineers,
photographers, and storytellers, all at once.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.650
Sometimes you’ll hear the cinematographer
referred to as the director of photography

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.650
or “DP.”

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.450
But don’t be confused, it’s the same job.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.140
In some parts of the world, they prefer one
title to the other, but generally speaking,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.620
the two titles are interchangeable.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.620
And no matter what they call themselves, their
basic job is to translate the director’s

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.140
vision into things like framing, lighting,
and camera movement, so that the film’s

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.140
story, emotions, and themes are conveyed visually.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.210
A cinematographer must not only possess great
technical skills, but also understand the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.180
fundamental narrative beats of the film, the
arc of the characters, and how the shots might

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.650
cut together in the editing room.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.270
And the job begins long before the cameras
start to roll.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.110
During pre-production, the cinematographer
assembles the camera department, plans shots

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.679
with the director, and determines any special
equipment that might be necessary for the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.320
shoot – from cranes and dollies to steadicams
and special lenses.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.609
They also help the director decide what kind
of film stock or digital cameras to use and

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:37.390
what the overall look of the film will be.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.289
During production itself, the cinematographer
oversees the lighting and shooting of the

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.380
film, shot by shot.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.520
This includes supervising the camera department
and working very closely with the lighting

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.520
department -- the head of which, you’ll
recall, is the gaffer.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.329
Since pictures are technically just a record
of light bouncing off objects, the gaffer

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.140
is fundamental to achieving the images that
make up the film.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.109
And when it comes to the lights themselves,
the cinematographer has a lot to choose from.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.740
For example, there are Fresnel lights, which
use special lenses called … Fresnel lenses

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.570
... to produce a wide, hard light that softens
at the edges.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.300
Commonly used for stage lighting, these lights
can get very hot very quickly.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.580
Fluorescent lights are much cooler and softer,
but they’re quite fragile, which matters

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.320
on a film set when the lights are being moved
around so frequently.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.471
LED lights create very little heat and are
favored by a lot of independent and DIY cinematographers

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:25.320
because they’re cheap and use less power.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.610
However, the colors and shadows they cast
can be unreliable and difficult to match,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.610
bulb to bulb.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.670
Incandescent lights, meanwhile, generate a
lot of heat, but they generally give a warm,

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.580
yellow light that can be very appealing.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.140
And then we have HMIs, or... this...

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.170
These are massive lights that give off an
enormous amount of heat.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.260
They’re so bright that they’re often used
to simulate daylight.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.360
As in, the sun.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.620
So, that’s the hardware, but in addition
to choosing which of these lights should be

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.000
used, the cinematographer also has a say in
how they’re arranged.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.230
The most basic style of lighting, used in
everything from formal interviews to fiction

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.420
films, is 3-point lighting.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.060
You start with a key light, which is the brightest
light, often positioned so that it shines

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.190
most directly on the subject of the shot.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.031
Then you add some fill light, which is a dimmer
and more diffuse light used to fill in the

00:03:11.031 --> 00:03:13.060
shadows created by the key light.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.150
Finally, back light, which is usually brighter
than the fill light, shines from behind the

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.670
subject of the shot.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.350
This creates a “halo” or “edge” of
light that outlines the subject and separates

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.350
it from the background.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.120
One of the questions the cinematographer grapples
with is figuring out where the light is coming

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.880
from in the world of the film.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.620
This will determine the direction, color,
intensity, and quality of light that illuminates

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.620
the shot.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.080
Sometimes cinematographers will use practical
lights, which are light sources you can actually

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.600
see in the shot, like desk lamps or windows.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.100
Other times they’ll deliberately use artificial
lights, or even turn to a more radical strategy

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.210
to light their films.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.540
Cinematographers Néstor Almendros and Haskell
Wexler famously shot Terrence Malick’s Days

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.930
of Heaven using natural sunlight, mostly that
brief period of the day immediately before

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.750
sunset, often called magic hour.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.330
While working on Catch-22, David Watkin said,
“I’m going to do something rather daring.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.720
I’m going to light the actors with only
explosions.”

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720
And he did!

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.910
Cinematographer Ellen Kuras relied on a unique
combination of practical and artificial lights

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.320
to create the unusual transitions and effects
of Jim Carrey’s memory loss in Eternal Sunshine

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
of the Spotless Mind.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.790
Malik Hassan Sayeed is a master of style,
shooting everything from Spike Lee’s He

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.070
Got Game to Beyoncé’s Lemonade.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.080
When Gordon Willis decided to light The Godfather
in such a way that Marlon Brando’s eyes

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.400
would often be in shadow, it was seen as a
risky and daring strategy.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.450
Cinematographers were supposed to light
a character’s eyes.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.270
That’s just how it was done!

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.160
Instead, Willis chose to use this lighting
“mistake” to illustrate the dark and unknowable

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.530
soul of Don Corleone.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.470
Now, the cinematographer also works closely
with the production designer, who’s the

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.470
head of the art department.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.810
The production designer is in charge of carrying
out the whole look of the film, particularly

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.980
the physical elements like sets, costumes,
props, hair and makeup, but also non-physical

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.980
elements like computer-generated images and
how they interact with the physical objects

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.980
on camera.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.320
The cinematographer and production designer
work closely on everything from the color

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.050
scheme of a set to how reflective its walls
should be.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.540
And for sure, in addition to the lighting,
cinematographers have to consider all kinds

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.450
of factors when setting up their shots.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.340
Not only do the shots need to cut together
to tell the story, but they’re often constructed

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.440
to have a beginning, middle, and end all their
own.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.480
The director and cinematographer must decide
how much of the frame should be in focus,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.730
using lens choice, film
stock, and aperture.

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.880
Related to that, the cinematographer has to
think about what’s featured in the foreground,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.430
middle ground, and background of the shot.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.790
The arrangement of these features within the
frame can have a profound impact on the audience.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.000
Color and contrast also fall within the cinematographer’s
aesthetic toolkit.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.130
Color can be used to draw our eye to or away
from one part of the frame, make narrative

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.050
or thematic links, or – as in The Wizard
of Oz – transport us to an entirely new

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.050
place!

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.820
Contrast, which refers to the ratio of the
darkest parts of the image to the lightest

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.050
parts, can perform many of the same functions.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.500
Before there was color in film, contrast was
a particularly powerful tool for cinematographers.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.860
Noir classics like Carol Reed’s The Third
Man use deep, dark shadows cut by bright shafts

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.440
of light to convey a sense of mystery and
menace .

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.960
Cinematographers might also decide to move the camera to evoke a particular feeling or

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.240
psychological effect.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.940
This movement might be as simple as a pan
or a tilt to follow the action, or as involved

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.419
as Citizen Kane’s dramatic crane shot in
through the top of a nightclub.

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.200
Moving the camera in toward a character can
convey a variety of emotions, from fear closing

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.590
in on them, to some kind of internal revelation.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.190
There are some pretty entertaining supercuts
of push-in shots on YouTube.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.850
It makes you realize this technique is used
everywhere.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.960
Now, what happens after the film is in the
can?

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.700
The job’s over, right?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:38.700
Of course not.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.610
The cinematographer is heavily involved in
a film’s post-production, too, because

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.090
the editing process offers a lots of opportunities
to manipulate the images that have been captured.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.990
If a movie’s been shot on film, there are
all kinds of options to change color or exposure

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.830
by altering chemicals and timing, as the exposed
negative is developed and processed.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.860
But whether the film was shot using traditional
film stock or a digital process, most feature

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.639
films are digitized at some point, to make
the editing easier.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.979
And once the images have been converted into
digital information, even more options open

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:07.370
up for manipulating the footage.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.680
Filters on photo apps like Instagram give
you some idea of how drastically you can change

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.520
a digital image after it’s been shot.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.820
In order to maintain the look of the film,
the cinematographer is almost always deeply

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.380
engaged in this process, working hand in hand
with the director, the editor, the post-production

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.650
supervisor who’s overseeing this phase of
the process, and the special effects department.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:28.120
So, yeah, it’s kind of a big job!

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.180
There’s a fantastic documentary called Visions
of Light that traces this history and art

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.180
of cinematography.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:37.120
It’s out of print, but if you can find a
copy of it, you can hear some of the original

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.760
masters of the medium share their stories
and see examples of their work.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.210
As with much of film production, there are
guidelines and customs when it comes to cinematography,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:46.520
but no actual rules.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.150
The right style of lighting or camera movement
for one film will be completely wrong for

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.150
another.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.230
It’s up to the cinematographer to work with
the director to realize their vision for the

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.120
film, translating int into images that will
cut together to tell the story.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.570
Today we learned about the multi-faceted job
of the cinematographer.

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.610
We covered the various roles of the camera
and lighting departments and how they work

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:07.919
together to realize a director’s vision.

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:11.650
And we considered some of the tools and strategies
available to the cinematographer.

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:16.040
Next time we’ll look at the fascinating
on-set work of set designers, costume designers,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.290
and special effects make-up!

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.419
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
