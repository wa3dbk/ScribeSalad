00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.180
Hi!

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.260
I’m not Craig.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.380
But you’re in the right place; this is still
Crash Course Film.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.120
My name is Lily Gladstone, and I’m excited
to spend the next fifteen episodes with

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.610
you exploring film production – how movies
actually get made.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.650
We’ll talk about all those jobs that are
listed in the credits, and how movies take

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.910
a huge amount of collaboration, whether
you have a crew of tens or thousands.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.881
We’ll go behind the scenes to see how movies
are planned, shot, and edited, and take a

00:00:24.881 --> 00:00:26.589
peek at all the equipment involved.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.980
And we’ll learn how films are marketed and
distributed, whether they go to movie theaters

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.980
or straight into your home.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.900
But, before we get anywhere near lights, camera, action...

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.680
We need to start with a road map that gives everyone in the cast and crew the directions they need to make a film.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.200
It’s time to talk about the screenplay.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:53.040
[Music Plays]

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.400
In most of these videos, we’ll be learning about how the vast majority of narrative fiction films get made.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.240
And to do that, we need to start with the
screenplay.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.579
A screenplay is a written version of a movie.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.120
Think of it as a blueprint.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.060
It’s not the final product; it’s a set
of plans to guide a team of artists, craftspeople,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.950
and engineers as they produce a film.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.280
Every screenplay is formatted with three basic
elements: sluglines, action, and dialogue.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.540
Each new scene begins with a slugline.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.120
It’s written in all-capital letters and
acts as a code to convey information to the crew.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.060
A slugline might look something like this:
INT.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.780
Here the INT. stands for interior, meaning

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.500
this scene takes place inside.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.390
If the scene takes place outside, the slugline
would start with EXT. for exterior.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.090
The second word tells us where the scene
takes place, which is important information

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.290
for a lot of the crew.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.650
The location scout needs to find somewhere
to film the scene, the production designer

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.380
alters the location to make it fit the world
of the film, and the cinematographer decides

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.380
how to light it.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.590
But before any of that happens, the line producer
uses the location to help figure out how much

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.590
the film is going to cost.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.400
The same goes for the last word in the slugline,
which describes when the scene takes place,

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.660
usually either day or night.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.130
Besides giving information to the crew, this
can affect the cost of the movie, partially

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.250
because shooting at night is more expensive.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.870
After the slugline comes the action.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.140
These are short, assertive sentences that
describe who’s in the scene and what they’re doing.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.380
Since you watch a movie unfold over time,
the action is written in present tense.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.879
So instead of writing: “Iron Man flew
across the sky,” you’d write:

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.170
“Iron Man flies across the sky.”

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.189
The action is also limited to what the audience
can see and hear.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.569
In a novel, you can describe what a character
is thinking and feeling.

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.950
Something like: “Luke Skywalker feels miserable.”

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.709
In the screenplay, you’d have to write an
action to show us how he feels, like:

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.660
“Luke Skywalker hangs his head and wipes away a tear.”

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.159
There are a lot of guidelines and tricks to
writing action lines, but the most important

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.019
rule is: show, don’t tell.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.959
Remember that this is where the thoughts,
feelings, and themes of the screenplay are

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.590
turned into actions you can see.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.859
And the final piece of a screenplay is the
dialogue.

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:43.599
These are the words spoken by characters.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.689
Feature-length screenplays are usually between
90 and 120 pages.

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:49.609
And each page typically becomes about a minute
of the final film.

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.259
This is more of an average than a hard rule,
by the way.

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.780
Some dialogue-heavy pages will likely be shorter
than a minute, while some pages with lots

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.760
of action may end up longer once the film
is shot and edited.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.349
Now, some stories are better suited to the
screen than others.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.780
Different media have different strengths,
so what makes a good poem or graphic novel

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.170
won’t necessarily make a good movie.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.980
A film creates an immersive visual world – that
“illusion of reality” we keep talking about.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.900
And within that world, it can tell a story
packed with complex ideas and emotions.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.959
Movies tend to focus on three main things:
a protagonist, which is the film’s main

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.251
character; a goal or objective, which is something
the protagonist wants; and obstacles, which

00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.579
is whatever’s standing between the protagonist
and their goal.

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.819
Think about a heist movie.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.310
Maybe a master criminal wants to steal the
world’s biggest diamond, but finds herself

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.990
facing off against a rival thief.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.670
Or a romantic comedy, where an awkward-but-loveable
introvert wants to date their outgoing neighbor,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.279
but is afraid to leave the comfort of his
routine.

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:42.299
Protagonist.

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:43.310
Goal.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.330
Obstacle.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.390
These are the building blocks of a screen
story, and it’s from these that everything

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.430
else emerges, like setting, character, theme,
and tone.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.090
Now, the protagonist doesn’t necessarily
have to be the story’s hero.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.359
Films are full of anti-heroes like Travis
Bickle in Taxi Driver, or accidental villains

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.450
like William H. Macy’s
character in Fargo.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.520
Usually, a movie’s protagonist will grow
or change in some way in pursuit of their goal.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.920
The master criminal might learn humility as
she attempts to steal the diamond.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.590
Or maybe the introvert overcomes his social
anxiety to befriend his love interest.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.380
But the most important thing for the screenwriter

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.079
is finding ways to make all of this come across visually.

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.860
One way to do that is by following what’s
known as the “Hero’s Journey.”

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.650
This is a template for character development
that was popularized by the American mythologist

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.650
Joseph Campbell.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.340
By looking at myths from cultures all over
the world, Campbell identified twelve common

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.100
steps taken by main characters as they transform
over the course of a story.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.070
These range from resisting the call to adventure
and meeting their mentor, to facing their

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.920
biggest fear and surviving a final ordeal,
armed with everything they’ve learned along the way.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.100
The Hero’s Journey was famously used by
George Lucas when writing Luke Skywalker’s

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.480
journey from Tatooine farm kid to Jedi knight.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.970
Some screenwriters love it, while others think
it’s a stale, overused formula.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.010
But if you’re looking to write your first
screenplay, it’s not a bad place to start.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.170
Once you have some characters and plot points,
you need to throw some conflict in the mix.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.510
Conflict moves a story forward, and helps
us identify with the protagonist as they’re

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.750
struggling against their obstacles.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.380
And screenplays can have different kinds of
conflict.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.000
External conflict occurs whenever the protagonist
encounters physical obstacles.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.440
Take the first Lord of the Rings film, The
Fellowship of the Ring.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.040
Our protagonist, Frodo, has a goal: to destroy
the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.500
No problem, right?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.110
Except, in order to get to Mount Doom, he
has to travel across the known world, avoid

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.680
an endless army of orcs and monsters, and
outwit this powerful fiery eye that’s searching for him.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.360
Not to mention, he’s the shortest guy in
the movie and they make him walk barefoot

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.390
the whole way.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:37.580
They don’t even give the poor guy shoes!

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.330
On the other hand, internal conflict is when
the protagonist wrestles with some emotional

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.830
or psychological obstacle.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.430
For Frodo, that could be his ignorance of
the wider world, a lack of faith in himself,

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:50.930
or even his jealousy and selfishness.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.660
Usually, the more conflict the protagonist
faces, the more they transform to overcome it.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.800
But that doesn’t mean that the fate of the
world has to be at stake in every single screenplay.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.040
The writer should scale the conflict to fit
the kind of story they’re telling.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.420
Like, in Bridesmaids, Kristin Wiig’s character just wants to be a good maid of honor to her best friend.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:12.880
She faces a lot of external conflict, from
a rival bridesmaid to some severely undercooked Brazilian food.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.560
And internally, she feels conflicted
about her best friend getting married, the

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.610
loss of her bakery, and her self-worth.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.750
The universe isn’t going to implode if she
doesn’t succeed, but we still empathize

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.360
with her as she struggles to achieve her goal.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.100
Now, once you have some ideas for the story
you want to tell, how are you supposed to

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.310
organize them all?

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.800
Screenwriters often use something called Three
Act Structure, which is based on theories

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.010
by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle
from more than 2,000 years ago.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.210
The idea is simple: that every story has a
beginning, middle, and end; and that certain

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.270
kinds of events happen in each section.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:49.250
Act One sets up the world of the screenplay,
introducing us to the characters, and identifying

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:50.650
the protagonist and their goal.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:53.560
In the Wizard of Oz, most of Act One takes
place in Kansas.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.860
It’s the black-and-white part.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.550
We get external conflicts between Dorothy
and that mean lady down the street, as well

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.800
as Aunt Em.We also learn that Dorothy is unsatisfied
with her life and dreams of something more

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.460
exciting, somewhere over the rainbow.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.620
Once she’s transported to Oz, she meets
her antagonist, the Wicked Witch of the West,

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:11.870
and we learn that her goal is to find the
wizard so she can go home.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.740
In Act Two, the protagonist faces increasingly
difficult conflicts as they pursue their goal.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.300
They meet allies, encounter successes and
setbacks, and are often brought to a point

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.300
of hopelessness.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.220
For Dorothy, this is when the wizard refuses
to take her home unless she can defeat the

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.220
Wicked Witch.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.360
To get what she wants, she’ll have to face
her fears and do the seemingly-impossible.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.690
Finally, Act Three contains the climax of
the film.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.740
There’s usually some epic face-off between
the protagonist and antagonist, the person

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.150
who most directly opposes them.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.860
That confrontation usually decides whether
or not the protagonist achieves their goal.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.710
And in most Hollywood screenplays, they do.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.180
Dorothy gets back to Kansas.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.620
Luke Skywalker blows up the Death Star.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.060
Simba defeats Scar and restores the circle
of life to the Pride Lands.But the guidelines

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.130
of the Three Act Structure are just that.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.130
Guidelines.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.590
Foreign and independent movies can have more
ambiguous endings, from the open-ended final

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:07.200
shots of The Wrestler or Birdman, to the heartbreak
of Brokeback Mountain or The Death of Mr. Lazarescu.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.200
Films like M*A*S*H, Traffic, or Magnolia split
their stories up among different protagonists,

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.340
while movies like Pulp Fiction and Memento
scramble time, telling their stories out of order.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.860
And films like Mulholland Drive, Rashomon,
or Man with a Movie Camera seem to reject

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.650
the Three Act Structure altogether.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.620
Remember: screenplays are one part of a longer
process; they’re a blueprint.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:31.240
Whether they follow more traditional rules
or invent their own, the clear, concise, visual

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.140
language of a screenplay provides the foundation
for all the work that is to come.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:38.660
Today we learned about the format of screenplays
and why they look the way they do.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.319
We talked about the essential building blocks
of a film story, and we broke down the traditional

00:08:42.319 --> 00:08:44.770
Three Act Structure: what happens when and
why.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.540
Next time, we’ll talk about pitching and
pre-production, as the cameras get ready to roll.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.279
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:55.810
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.649
Coma Niddy, It’s Okay to be Smart, and Physics
Girl.

00:08:58.649 --> 00:09:02.740
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.720
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team, is Thought Cafe.
