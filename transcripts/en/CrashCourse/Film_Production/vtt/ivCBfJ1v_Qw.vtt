00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.440
Hey, you! Yeah, I’m talking to you. But,
I’m actually talking to a camera.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.470
A camera is a collection of parts that can

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.500
help you tell a visual story. It takes in
light through a lens and captures images,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.980
creating that illusion of reality we keep
talking about.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.080
You could even use your cell phone camera
to make a movie! But filmmakers usually have

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.670
equipment that gives them a lot more control.
So, let’s look through the eyes of a cinematographer,

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.880
and see how they combine camera technology
and the language of film to get that perfect shot

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:39.560
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.120
Let’s start with the tool that focuses light
into a camera: the lens.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.360
Some cameras have a lens that’s permanently
attached, but others have a separate body

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.899
with a lens mount, where you can swap out
different lenses for more creative control.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.130
For instance, low-budget filmmakers can rent
great lenses for cost-effective cameras to

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.740
improve their footage quality. Or they might use older lenses to make a period piece feel more authentic.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.620
All lenses have either a fixed or variable

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.080
focal length, which is the distance from the center of the lens to where the image is in focus.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.030
And focal length determines your field of view,

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.259
which is how much you can see in frame.
It’s usually measured in millimeters, and

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.479
a 50mm lens is generally thought to be closest
to how our eyes frame the world.

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.539
A fixed focal length lens can be called a
prime lens. It tends to have higher quality

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.219
glass because it’s specialized for just
one focal length.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.979
On the other hand, a variable focal length
lens is more versatile. It’s also called

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.360
a zoom lens, because it can zoom in and out.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.540
Now, you can also control how much light

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.159
gets into the camera body through a hole called
the aperture.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.980
It works like the iris and pupil in your eye,
becoming wider or narrower to let more or

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.409
less light through the lens. Aperture is measured
in f-stops. That lowercase “f” stands

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.820
for focal length, because it’s the ratio
of the focal length compared to the diameter of the aperture.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.240
An f/1.2 lens, for example, can open wider

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.390
than an f/5.6. So when you “stop down”
your aperture, you’re making that diameter

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.480
of the opening smaller, letting less light
in, and changing that ratio.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.400
But, as you stop down, you'll notice that the number is actually getting larger.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.539
And to control how long the film or sensor
inside is exposed to light, you can adjust

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.729
the camera’s shutter speed. You can think
of a typical shutter as a door in the lens

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.140
that opens and closes really quickly.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.049
If you have an aperture that can open wider,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.200
like in a f/1.2 lens, you can let more light
in, and have a faster shutter speed.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.959
Usually your shutter speed is about double your frame
rate. So if you’re shooting 24 frames per

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.680
second, for instance, your shutter speed would
be 1/50 seconds.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.080
But there’s one little problem with shutters
that work like a door: they click. Which can get noisy.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.820
So on some movie film cameras, you’ll have a shutter angle instead of a shutter speed.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.060
These shutters are rotary
discs that spin, to control the amount of

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.799
light that enters an opening into the camera.
A smaller shutter angle works like a faster

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.719
shutter speed: the image will be exposed more
quickly, and it’ll look crisper! With a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.400
larger shutter angle or slower shutter speed, the image will be smoother and have more blur from any motion.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.379
How light gets turned into an image depends

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.170
on what kind of camera you’re using.
In a film camera, the light hits the chemical-coated

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.370
film strip at an opening called the gate,
which exposes it so it retains an image.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.659
In a digital camera, the light heads to an
electronic sensor, which translates the light

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.219
energy into a digital image. The camera that’s
filming me right now has what’s called a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.260
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor, or
CMOS, sensor.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.820
Other digital cameras might
have a Charged Coupled Device, or a CCD, which

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.680
uses more power, but produces better images
than earlier CMOS sensors.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.110
Both film and digital sensors also have a
property called ISO. The higher the ISO number,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.200
the more sensitive they are to light.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.760
The name comes from the International Standards Organization,

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.160
which created the scale filmmakers
use.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.760
Generally, the lower your ISO, the cleaner and richer your images will look.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.600
But, if you’re in a room without a lot of light, your image will be pretty dark.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.700
In this case, it’s
tempting to just bump your ISO way up to like

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.360
1600, to increase sensitivity to available light.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.940
You’ve gotta be careful with that, though.
Depending on the camera or film stock, raising

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.900
the ISO to compensate for low light just brightens
everything in frame, and can result in grainy,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.609
lower-quality footage.
So, instead of raising your ISO, you might

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.670
wanna add more light to the scene and open
the aperture to allow as much of it in as possible.

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.890
Now, imagine you’ve put everything we’ve

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.540
talked about to use. You’ve adjusted your
lens, aperture, shutter speed, and ISO, and

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.800
captured some beautiful footage.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.180
All that
footage is stored on what’s called the media.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.360
In a film camera, the media is the film itself. As long as you don’t lose or ruin it, you’ll always have what you shot.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.760
In a digital camera, the media is a data storage

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.389
device like tape, drives, or cards. And you’ll
have to decide on a codec.

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.590
“Codec” is a portmanteau of “coder”
and “decoder.” Because that’s what it does.

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.280
It’s a program that can compress what
the camera has shot onto your storage device,

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.340
and then decompress that footage when you
need to work with it in post-production.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.030
Basically, it’s like a little package of
digital information. You might recognize a

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.760
codec like H.264. Or mp3!

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.100
Shooting in raw
means the images don’t get packaged or processed.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.080
You get higher quality footage, but you need
a bunch of storage because those image files get huge.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.740
Now, understanding how a camera works is only part of a filmmaker’s job.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.340
Film sets
have an entire team of talented artists working

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.090
to create the visual story of a movie.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.251
The Director of Photography, or cinematographer,
is the head of the camera department. They

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.840
create the shot list with the director, to
plan how everything in the screenplay will be captured visually.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.840
The camera operator is the person who actually

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.660
controls the camera and frames the shots.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.660
Sometimes you need a static shot, so the camera

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.780
operator uses a tripod. The cool kids call
this a camera “on sticks.”

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.639
Or, sometimes you want a moving shot, so the
operator uses a handheld camera, or attaches

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.449
one to a mechanical cart called a dolly. There’s
also a device called a steadicam, which makes

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:15.440
a shot smoother than handheld, but not as
smooth as a dolly.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.069
Now, the person who manages all this equipment
and sets up the camera is the First Assistant

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:23.449
Camera, or 1st AC. They work under the main
camera operator. Sometimes, you’ll hear

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.630
this job referred to as Focus Puller because
the 1st AC controls the camera lens to focus

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.280
on the actors as they move through the scene.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.380
It might sound simple, but for decades focus pullers couldn’t look through the camera lens while doing their job,

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.900
because the camera operator was looking through the lens.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.480
Nowadays, the 1st AC will usually have a monitor,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.180
but they also have to rely on detailed marks
from rehearsal and a whole lot of skill.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.310
The 2nd AC takes all the camera notes for
each shot and operates the slate, or clapper,

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.440
to mark each scene.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.960
...ooof... Soft Sticks.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.180
They also haul equipment
around, from cameras to media.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.620
If you’re shooting film, a 2nd AC is the
film loader, who changes the camera magazines

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:01.330
with rolls of film inside. And if you’re
shooting digital, the 2nd AC is responsible

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.050
for getting any storage devices to the Digital
Imaging Technician, or DIT, who manages all the media.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.409
Now, you might understand the nuts and bolts

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.380
of a camera, but it’s all for nothing if
you’re not using these tools to tell a story.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.940
Making the audience feel something because of moving pictures – that’s what makes movies magic!

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.760
From a voyeur shot through a window in a horror movie,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.300
to the subtle push on the love interest
in a melodrama, there’s a language and an

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.640
artistry to framing, angles, and camera movements.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.560
Take the rule of thirds, which is a general way to think about composing a frame.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.760
The
idea is to divide it up into vertical and 
horizontal thirds,

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.880
and then stick what you
want people to focus on where those lines intersect.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.699
What or who dominates a frame can affect how

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.580
an audience views a scene. And what’s in
or out of focus can steer our attention even more.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.740
For instance, in the film Road to Perdition,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.560
the cinematographer Conrad Hall combined these
storytelling tools really beautifully.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.569
In one scene, a character played by Daniel
Craig is dominating the frame, but the other

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.479
two men walking away from him, played by Paul
Newman and Tom Hanks, are the ones in focus.

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.640
So our attention is on Daniel Craig’s character
because he’s front and center in the scene.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:03.039
But because the other men are kept in focus,
we can feel that he’s thinking about them

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.060
– all through the visual storytelling.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.960
Even if you can compose what looks like the perfect frame,

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.580
it’s important to remember that cameras
aren’t static!

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.720
Camera movements have their own language
too. This is a pan, moving left to right.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.420
A push is when the camera is literally pushed
closer to the action in a scene.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.620
It’s like we’re leaning in, and builds intensity.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.259
And a pull is the opposite! The camera physically
moves back. This could reveal something that

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:26.629
we couldn’t see before, or help us leave
a scene and lessen our connection.

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:30.790
Pushes and pulls are often achieved by using
a dolly to move the camera closer and farther

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.229
from the action. They have a different look
to them than just changing the focal length

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:35.229
of a zoom lens.

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.949
If you want to get really fancy, you can use
a tracking shot to move the camera with

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:42.740
your actors, like by moving a camera on a
dolly parallel to the action.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:47.000
Now, even how a camera is set up can affect
the visual storytelling in a movie. A camera

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.780
on a tripod is “locked down” and can make
a scene feel safe and stable, like when a

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.289
character who craves adventure is sitting
at home in their regular life. But when they’re

00:07:54.289 --> 00:07:57.780
introduced to whatever’s going to rock their
world, and jump up, the camera might move too.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:01.220
On the other end of the spectrum are handheld
cameras. Think of those horror movies with

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.980
shaky cameras – they’re harder to see
and understand, but feel more chaotic and unstable.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.199
The real job of the camera is to capture visuals

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.889
that let us enter the worlds of movies, and
feel what the characters feel.

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:15.600
Knowing how a camera works can help strengthen
your storytelling, but a lot of it comes down

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.900
to becoming fluent in the language of film.
And that, like all of these jobs, comes with

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.000
a ton of practice.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.040
Today, we talked about the guts of the camera

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.930
and how they come together to make a versatile
piece of equipment. We learned about the positions

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.509
in the camera crew, and how the poetry of
framing, angles, and camera movement are what

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:34.500
make it a powerful storytelling tool.
And next time, we’ll talk about the counterpart

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.420
to the camera’s visuals: sound.

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:40.641
