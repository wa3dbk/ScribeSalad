00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.880
So you want to make a movie!

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.859
Let’s say you’ve already written a screenplay
you want to shoot, or found a story you’d

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:08.870
like to adapt.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.179
Or maybe you just have an idea that you think
would make a good film.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.179
What’s next?

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.309
There are a few steps you should take to sharpen
your idea and get all the pieces into place

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.860
to make production go as smoothly as possible.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.460
Most filmmakers go through this process one
way or another, whether you’re making a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.500
big-time studio blockbuster or a no-budget
indie with your friends.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.600
It all begins with an awesome pitch.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:38.600
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.640
A pitch is a brief, verbal description of

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.950
a project you’d like to make.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.760
It’s supposed to be persuasive: You’re
trying to get people excited about your idea,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.010
usually because you need their help.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.210
We pitch things all the time.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.770
Kids try to persuade their parents to buy
them a dog or a car.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.750
Employees make a case to get a promotion or
a raise.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.380
And people try to convince their friends to
see the new Superman movie.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.900
But in addition to getting people on board
with your project, a pitch can be a great

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.800
way to help you figure out if your story works
in the first place.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.320
Is the concept compelling?

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.350
Is the climax satisfying?

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.100
Do the characters feel real and three-dimensional?

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.750
By gauging someone’s response, you might
decide to alter the plot, or re-think the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.010
entire film.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.220
And you can pitch an idea to just about anyone!

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.000
The late screenwriter, author, and educator
Blake Snyder suggested telling your film idea

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.440
to as many strangers as possible – bank
tellers, Uber drivers, the person waiting

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240
in line behind you at the grocery store.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.460
He believed that you’d get a more honest
reaction by pitching your story to someone

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.460
you don’t know.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.000
Your mom might love whatever you tell her.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.680
The woman sitting next to you on the plane?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:33.680
Not so much.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.120
On the other hand, sometimes you might need a little encouragement.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.721
And even if your parents and friends don’t
give you honest critical feedback, the act

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.750
of telling your story out loud can help you
understand it better.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.080
A lot of filmmakers even pitch their movie
ideas to themselves: in the shower, in the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.480
car, or pacing around a room while talking
to their cat.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.010
Bottom line is, stories get better the more
you tell them.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.780
You can identify the pieces that work and
figure out weaknesses before you start producing anything.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.740
On the practical side, a pitch can get you
thinking about the resources you’ll need

00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:00.680
to bring your story to the screen, and help
get your film made.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.890
Screenwriters might pitch an idea to a producer
or a studio executive, in hopes that person

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.619
will pay them to write the script.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.060
Directors might pitch a project to a studio
or an investor to raise money to shoot it.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.590
And filmmakers often pitch their movies to
well-known actors, hoping to persuade them

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.590
to star in the film.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.950
Developing a pitch can also help you ballpark
your film’s budget.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.480
Not just in terms of money, but also how much
time it will take, how big a crew you’ll

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.230
need, and what sort of special effects or
extra equipment you’ll require.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.480
So how do you craft a movie pitch?Well, there’s
not a single formula, but there are a few

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.459
ingredients that most good pitches have.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.430
First of all, you should deliver your pitch
with excitement and confidence.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.409
You want your passion for your movie to be
infectious, and you want whoever’s listening

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.939
to believe you can pull it off.

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.909
Second, you might compare your film to other
successful movies that explore similar worlds

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.129
or have similar tones.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.370
We call these comparisons, or comps for short.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.790
Like, you might pitch The Martian as Cast
Away on Mars.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.419
Or maybe The Edge of Tomorrow as Groundhog
Day by way of Independence Day.

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.620
Comps aren’t meant to limit your story or
make it seem like a copy of something else.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.419
The goal is to convey the scope, genre, and
tone of your film.

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.680
Another thing most pitches include is a logline.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.769
This is a one-sentence summary of your movie
that includes the genre, a description of

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.349
the protagonist, and a concise outline of
the plot.

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.150
The logline for Jaws, for instance, might
go something like this:

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.549
when a killer shark starts eating members
of a tourist beach town, the new chief of

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.519
police must overcome his fear of the water
to save his community.

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.879
Next, your pitch should include some information
about the characters and story.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.590
This isn’t a painstaking scene-by-scene
description – just the main plot points,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.409
key character moments, and enough of the emotional
arc to communicate why the story matters.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:32.510
Some pitches can include visual aids: posters,
photographs, or even pre-designed trailers.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.129
These work best when the film is set in another
time or place, like fantasy or science-fiction

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.939
movies that need a lot of world-building.

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:40.959
Your pitch could also suggest some casting
ideas.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.970
Would Reese Witherspoon be great for your
satirical comedy?

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.239
Is your gritty noir perfect for a brooding
Idris Elba type?

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.519
Even if you don’t expect to have A-list
actors in your film, it can give your listener

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.209
a clearer idea of what the movie will look
and feel like.

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.639
Plus, you never know.

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.370
Lucy Liu might be their second cousin!

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.139
Finally, the pitch should tell us who you
think will watch the film.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.430
How big is the potential audience?

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.739
What kind of resources will you need to market
and distribute it?

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.129
Is it a short film that you hope to screen
at film festivals, or a blockbuster that will

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.329
open in two thousand theaters?

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.290
Preparing a pitch that covers all these points
can improve your chances of getting your movie

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.359
made, while also making the story clearer
and stronger.

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.639
Now, let’s say you’ve honed your pitch,
written your script, and collected all the

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.580
resources you need to make the film.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.650
Next, you have to get ready to shoot it.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.520
We call this part of the process pre-production.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.919
It’s the unglamorous work of making all
the creative decisions and logistical plans

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.550
you can before the cameras start to roll.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.050
Depending on the size and scale of your film,
there are hundreds or even thousands of choices

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.050
to make.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.949
During pre-production, you’ll cast your
film.

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.530
Whether you’re convincing family and friends
to act for you, or working with a casting

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.290
director and watching audition tapes, you’ll
need a person to play every character.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.389
That includes lead actors, supporting actors,
and background actors to be extras – pedestrians

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.259
on the street, diners at a restaurant, or
fans at a baseball game.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.160
You’ll also need to assemble your crew.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.440
These are the artists, technicians, and craftspeople
who will physically make the movie, from

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.259
a cinematographer to oversee the camera department,
to an assistant director to make sure you’re

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:06.919
staying on schedule and on budget.

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.970
There are a ton of people that can be a
part of the crew, and we’ll talk about all

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.210
these roles in more detail in later episodes.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.480
And besides assembling a dream team of people,
you’ll also need to establish the look of the film.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.840
You have to figure out things like the color
scheme, the lighting plan, and when it takes place.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.860
To tell your story, will you need unique props
or costumes?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.660
Are there special effects involved, and how
do you need to plan for those during the actual shoot?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.699
You’ll also need to find and secure all
of your locations during pre-production – whether

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.750
you need to build futuristic spaceship sets,
or if you can just shoot in your mom’s basement.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.889
And that’s only a fraction of the questions
you should be considering:

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.830
Does your lead actor need a dialect coach
to learn a Dutch accent?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.159
Do you need a stunt coordinator to plan your
big action sequence?

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.319
How many sandwiches will you need to order on day three to feed your cast and crew?

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.669
Pre-production can be an exhausting process,
but also an exhilarating one.

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.780
Even though you haven’t shot a single frame
yet, you’re already making your movie!

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.300
And one of your biggest assets while making
all these decisions is that screenplay you’ve

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:01.300
polished to perfection.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.490
Either you or your line producer will do a
breakdown of the script.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.780
This is essentially a big list of every character,
location, prop, costume, vehicle, and any

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:09.830
special needs of your film.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.580
If you’re doing this on your own, a handy
trick is to take a highlighter and mark every

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.540
single noun in your script.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.569
That way, you can make sure you’ve accounted
for all the things you need to gather to

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:21.000
make your film, no matter how incidental they
may be.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.259
Once you have a breakdown, you can figure
out the film’s shooting schedule, which

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.949
details what scenes you’re going to film
and when.

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.509
Like, let’s say you’re making a movie
based on the board game Clue.Armed with the

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:35.060
breakdown and shooting schedule, you’ll
know things like: on day five, you’re going

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.719
to be shooting Scene 14.

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:40.700
You should plan out when and where the cast
and crew are expected to arrive on set, down

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.439
to details like meal breaks and transportations
times.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.860
You’ll need most of your leading actors:
Colonel Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Mrs. White,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.860
and Mr. Boddy.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.560
You’ll need your actors to be fully costumed,
and you’ll also need some props: a candlestick,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.930
a lead pipe, and a knife.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.920
You’ll need some fake blood too, because
this is the scene where Mr. Boddy’s been stabbed.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.860
And it all takes place in the “Study”
location, so that needs to be ready to go too.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.520
Now, all this information will be compiled
into a call sheet.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.009
This is a document given to every member of
the cast and crew before the next shooting

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:11.469
day, so they have everything they need to
get prepared to work.

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:16.090
Call sheets also include a weather forecast
for each location, times for sunrise and sunset,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.310
the addresses of nearby emergency services,
and maps from the set to things like the hair

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.320
and makeup trailer or the restrooms.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.909
Finally, call sheets have contact information
for nearly everybody in the crew.

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.870
This comprehensive document is a culmination
of all the work of pre-production.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.039
Armed with it, you’re finally ready to get
down to business and make your movie!

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:36.620
Today we talked about what goes into a movie
pitch and who you might share it with.

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.939
We learned the basic steps of pre-production,
from assembling your crew to building your

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:40.939
schedule, to best set you up to start making
your film.

00:07:40.939 --> 00:07:45.440
And next time, we’ll visit the set and explore
what the crew actually does once the cameras

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.440
start rolling.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.199
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
