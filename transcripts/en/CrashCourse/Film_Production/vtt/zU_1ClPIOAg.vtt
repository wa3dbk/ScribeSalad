00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.132
No movie in the entire history of film has
been made without a producer, whether or not

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.210
they were credited as one.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.420
But no one ever seems to know what they do.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.049
To be fair, it’s a little confusing.

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.640
There are different kinds of producers, and
people earn the title of producer for different reasons.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.720
But the job is really hard work.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.740
They’re the driving force of a movie: getting
a film crew off the ground, keeping everything

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.150
running, and making sure it gets shared with
the world.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.690
If a film doesn’t get finished... well,
chances are, it could’ve used a team of producers.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:42.000
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.760
Let’s start with a wide lens and then zoom in.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.560
See what I did there? Film jokes!

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.340
An executive producer, or EP, oversees the
whole filmmaking process and other producers

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.360
involved in the project.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.059
This person might be independent and run a
small studio, like with Crash Course.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.000
Or they might work for a larger company, and
represent the studio or the money person – the financier.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.239
An executive producer ensures a film has the
funding it requires, and usually sets the

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.960
budget and overall schedule.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
They can be deeply influential on the style
of the film, too.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.720
Think of movies that were executive produced
by Steven Spielberg.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.020
Or Judd Apatow.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.020
Or Tina Fey.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.990
They’re all different from each other, but
distinct to their EP.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.700
While the job can be highly demanding, sometimes
people are honored with the title because

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.920
they’re lending their well-known names to
a production they believe in.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.580
These honorary executive producers might not
be involved in the daily grind, but they’re

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.460
very important in helping it get made.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.560
If you have student loans, you’ll understand
when I say that an honorary EP can be like

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.700
a really wonderful co-signer.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.440
They’re standing behind your project and
promising to the world that you’re going

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.590
to deliver a film that’s up to their standards.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.510
Even when a film has honorary EPs, it’ll
still have an executive producer who’s keeping

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.299
things running on a macro scale and looking
towards the future: a movie they can sell

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.390
and get to an audience.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.330
Now, an EP is one kind of producer, and
there are lots of different producer roles

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.330
that we’ll get to soon.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.350
But the simple title of “producer” is
usually where the job description seems the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.600
most... nebulous.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.670
Like, “what-the-heck-do-they-do” kind
of nebulous.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.140
Turns out, there’s no one thing that a producer
is or does.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.450
Really, the title can be given to anyone
who was essential in making sure the film

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.450
got made.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.670
This could mean they found funding and resources.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.510
Or maybe they developed the idea, balancing
big picture stuff.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.530
Or they might have brought the creative team
together, and hammered out the details that

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.650
make a film set run well.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.800
So things can get a little confusing when
you’re reading the credits of a film.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.280
But, not to worry, there’s a code that we
can decipher.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.660
The person who we think of as THE producer will be listed in the credits after the phrase

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.660
“produced by”.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.739
This is the person, or sometimes couple
of people, with the seemingly never-ending

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.760
list of responsibilities.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.170
They’re the point of contact through every
stage of the film, and ultimately responsible

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.321
for the movie becoming a movie at all.

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:42.350
In pre-production, the producer finds a project
and develops it with a writer.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.060
Then, they gather the resources and hire the
key crew members for production.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.820
During production, they oversee filming, and
help run the shoot.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.520
And in post-production, the producer works
with the director, editor, and composer to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.720
finish the film.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.390
They can even have the editor cut scenes or
schedule reshoots – if that’s what the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.390
film needs to come together.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.960
Their ultimate goal is to crystallize the
vision of the filmmaker and find a way to sell it.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.500
To be clear... not in a skeezy way.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.629
Filmmaking is really expensive.

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.780
So financiers will pay for a movie up front,
and you want to pay them back for their investment.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.320
Plus, selling the film to distributors is
the only way to get all your hard work out

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.320
into the world.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.440
And it’s not really a movie until an audience
sees it.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.300
So, okay.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.740
Now that we have a handle on producers, what
in the world is a co-producer?

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.629
This title is actually great, because it’s
descriptive!

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.920
A co-producer is part of a producing team.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.129
Two or more co-producers will produce a film
as a unit.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.349
Sometimes, a co-producer will have another
role in the film.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.680
Like, maybe they’re also a writer or an
actor, so they’re not involved in all the

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.930
producing responsibilities.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.770
An assistant or associate producer works under
the head honcho producer.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.430
On a large production, the producer delegates
work to one or more of them.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.209
Associate producer, like executive producer,
can also be an honorary title given to someone

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.200
who helped get the film made, like because
they lent their name to the project, or funded it.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.080
Now, let’s talk about specific producer
titles and their duties.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.489
The line producer reports to the producer.

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.819
And all the department heads report to the
line producer.

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.299
The line producer plans and orchestrates the
logistics of the entire production, including

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.750
scheduling, staffing, and managing how the
budget is used.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.260
Does this sound kind of familiar?

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.940
On lower-budget films, the line producer and
the unit production manager might be the same person.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.391
But if they’re not, the line producer plans
all the budgets and other minutia, while the

00:04:15.391 --> 00:04:17.599
UPM carries out the line producer’s plans.

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:21.119
Sometimes, usually on a TV show or a series
like Crash Course, you’ll see the title

00:04:21.119 --> 00:04:23.249
supervising producer, or senior producer.

00:04:23.249 --> 00:04:28.099
They help guide the whole project both logistically
and creatively, and report directly to the

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:29.099
executive producer.

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.210
So, now that we’ve got the basic scoop on
what producers do, here’s a puzzle for you.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.919
And, honestly, for the Academy of Arts and
Sciences too.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.840
Who accepts the Oscar for best picture?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.440
See, the director is often thought of as “the
filmmaker,” but they’ve got their own

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.789
category: best director.

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.939
So the winner of best picture is the producers!

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:48.369
They’re usually the ones who chose to make this particular movie and who hired all

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:49.379
the creative leads.

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:51.439
So, they deserve some recognition too.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.740
Sometimes you’ll see a director or writer
run up on stage to accept the Oscar, because

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.819
they were also producer.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.369
And there are a lot of reasons why someone
would want to wear so many hats, even though

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:01.379
it’s difficult work.

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:02.569
One is control.

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.370
What we think of as the creative roles – like
writer, director, or even actor – ultimately

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.629
answer to the producers.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.870
So if you’re one of those producers, you
have more control over the film.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.050
This can mean creative control, because you’re
helping move the film through production.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:17.849
Or it might mean financial or marketing control,
because producers typically help decide what

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.089
festivals and audiences the film will reach.

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:23.819
Secondly, if someone has proven themselves
to be multi-talented, studios will sometimes

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:26.030
prefer to pay one person to do multiple jobs.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.879
Because, remember, filmmaking is expensive!

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:33.289
A lot of the time, director/producers or writer/director/producers
are highly experienced auteurs who have the

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.050
best understanding of a project.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.199
So if they wear multiple hats, it can really
help the movie’s success.

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.699
That said, it’s extremely rare for there
to be just one producer on a project.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:45.610
There’s still THE producer with the “produced
by” credit, and the line producer organizing

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.479
the production, not to mention any other producers
and executive producers on the team.

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:52.939
That way, if the director-producer needs to
focus their whole attention on directing

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.509
at some point, they can!

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:55.659
And the production will go on.

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.520
Oddly enough though, the producing team
doesn’t really seem to scale like other departments.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.849
Like, a couple episodes ago we had a note
comparing the scale of two movies starring

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.169
Felicity Jones, Rogue One and Like Crazy.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:08.899
Across the board, there were a lot more people
and departments working on Rogue One.

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:14.110
For instance, the art department for Rogue
One included 174 credits, while Like Crazy’s

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.259
was just 4 people.

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:17.319
But that wasn’t true for producers.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.759
Rogue One credited 10 producers, while Like
Crazy credited 13.

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.940
So, how does a movie with a much smaller crew
and budget justify having three more producers

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.149
than one with a massive team and 800 times
the budget?

00:06:28.149 --> 00:06:32.179
Well, there are a couple possibilities.For
one, a filmmaker can need an army, but you

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:35.149
can also make a movie with a small group of
multi-talented people.

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:38.779
While anyone on a film set is most likely
going to be a hard worker, on a low-budget

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:42.810
film you end up relying on a few heroes who
really go above and beyond.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.990
Often, those people are thanked with a producer
credit of some kind.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.659
Another option is that sometimes people who
usually fill a different role on film projects,

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.439
like a makeup artist or sound mixer, want
to get into producing.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.539
And they’d do that by starting out small,
and producing a low-budget film.

00:06:55.539 --> 00:06:59.629
Third of all, independent films usually benefit
most from an honorary executive producer lending

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:00.629
their clout.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.110
So, more producers might be credited for name
recognition reasons.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.550
Fourthly, it’s a good way to stretch your
budget.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.179
Like, if you can’t afford a lead actor’s
salary, you might ask them to be a producer

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:11.080
too, so the project will be worth their while.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.849
They’ll have another credit on their resume,
a foot in the door to a new job in the industry,

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:17.139
plus more control over the film.

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:20.669
Any of these reasons could be why a small,
independent film such as Like Crazy would

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:22.270
have more producers than Rogue One.

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:25.699
But, after looking a little closer at their
credits, here’s a different guess.

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:29.909
You see, one of THE producers – one of the
people Rogue One was produced by –

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:30.909
was Kathleen Kennedy.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:35.360
She’s a very, very experienced producer
and has led Lucasfilm since 2012.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.809
Think of some of the biggest blockbusters from the last 35 years, chances are Kathleen Kennedy was

00:07:39.809 --> 00:07:40.809
a producer on it.

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:41.900
Jurassic Park?

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.900
Yep.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:43.900
Back to the Future?

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:44.900
Yep.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.900
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.900
The Sixth Sense?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.900
Indiana Jones?

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.800
Yep, yep, yep.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.599
And that goes to show how critical good producers
are to the success of a film.

00:07:52.599 --> 00:07:55.930
Even though it might be a little confusing
what they do, because they do so many things,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.989
it’s all incredibly important work.

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:01.580
Today we learned about lots of ways a person
can earn the title of producer.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:05.300
We broke down some different roles, from executive
producers to line producers, and talked about

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.110
how they each help a film get made.

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:11.240
And next time we’ll talk about the person
who most influences what a film will be:

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.240
the director.

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:15.669
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:08:15.669 --> 00:08:19.490
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

like Deep Look, Artrageous with Nate, and
PBS Space Time.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:27.719
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.840
with the help of these nice people and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
