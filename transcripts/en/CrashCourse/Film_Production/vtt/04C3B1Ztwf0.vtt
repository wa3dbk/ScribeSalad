00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.440
Let's say you made a movie.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.820
You wrote a script, prepared the shoot, assembled
a cast and crew, shot the film, edited it,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.150
and sound mixed the thing until it’s ready
for the world.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.420
And it’s awesome.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.420
Congratulations!

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.160
Now… you just have to convince an audience
to come see it.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.660
These days, that’s more important than ever.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.990
With hundreds of films, TV series, and online
videos competing for our attention, filmmakers

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.059
and distribution companies need to find creative
ways to make their content stand out.

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.110
From posters and trailers to celebrity press
junkets, let’s take a peek at the world

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.720
of marketing.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:43.800
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.710
In the earliest days of film, movies were

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.710
the marketing.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.600
People bought tickets just to see pictures
move on a screen.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.670
As it became clear that film was going to
endure as a source of mass entertainment and

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.079
communication, a permanent infrastructure
emerged – things like movie studios and

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.079
theater chains.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.910
Those studios started making more movies to
keep up with demand.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.489
And, suddenly, moviegoers had options!

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.650
Audiences also became more sophisticated viewers.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.790
They wanted stories, and they wanted stars.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.250
Film studios and distributors were faced with
greater competition and needed to find ways

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.200
to persuade people to see their film, instead
of somebody else’s.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.670
That’s where marketing comes in.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.420
And, in fact, many of the elements of cinema’s
earliest marketing campaigns are still with

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
us today.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.230
In the 1910s, the studios that made and distributed
films noticed that more people bought tickets

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.030
for movies starring actors like Florence Lawrence,
Mary Pickford, and Lillian Gish.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.120
So they began to market their films based
on celebrities, which helped create the star system.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.229
Celebrities continue to be a powerful weapon
in a film’s marketing arsenal to this day.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.420
They can be deployed to talk shows, magazine
spreads, or press junkets, where hundreds

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.650
of journalists are wined, dined, and given
a few precious moments to interview a personality.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.040
Today’s celebrities also leverage their
own social media to increase hype around their movies.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.950
But as flashy as the star system is, in many
ways, the cornerstone of film marketing is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.460
the poster or one sheet.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.170
Whether they’re organized around an iconic
image from the film, or covered with the movie’s

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.229
most famous actors, these graphic designs
can be used in print ads, transformed into

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170
billboards, or displayed outside theaters.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.710
The best posters represent a movie in a single,
powerful image.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.380
Think of the shark rising up toward the swimmer
on the Jaws poster, or the moth over Jodie

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.450
Foster’s mouth from The Silence of the Lambs.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.730
Posters often include taglines as well – brief,
memorable catch-phrases that sum up the theme

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.730
of the movie.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.499
Like Alien: “In space, no one can hear you
scream.”

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.319
Or The Shawshank Redemption: “Fear can hold
you prisoner, hope can set you free.”

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.439
Posters might also feature quotes from film
critics.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.510
Remember, this is all an act of persuasion,
so if critics are raving, people might get

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.860
curious enough to see a movie for themselves.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.750
Trailers or previews were another early development
in film marketing.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.440
The earliest trailers appeared at the end
of serials, early short films that told a

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.719
longer story in weekly installments.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.680
Each episode would end with some kind of cliffhanger,
and include a shot from the next week’s film.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.920
Once feature films became the norm, studios
would mine a film for shots of its most famous actors.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.120
Then, they would pair those shots with title
cards – or after the advent of sound, a

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.240
narrator – to tell the audience how incredible
the movie was going to be.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.559
In the 1960s, American movie trailers began
to break this mold.

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:14.249
Alfred Hitchcock famously starred in the trailer
for Psycho, in which he gave the audience

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.000
a walking tour of the film’s set, describing
where various grisly murders took place.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.359
In 1964, Stanley Kubrick made his own trailer
for Dr. Strangelove.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.930
It’s a funny, fragmented creation, intercutting
very short clips from the movie with title

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.000
cards that ask the movie’s big questions.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.080
Since the 1970s, films have also advertised
on television.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.280
Jaws was among the first, featuring a shortened
version of the theatrical trailer.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.549
And during this time, another big change came
to Hollywood marketing.

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.449
Before the 1970s, the marketing departments
of major movie studios began their work after

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:59.479
a film was done.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.779
The studio produced the movie, and then the
marketing people sold it to an audience.

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:07.419
But by the 1980s, those studios had all been
purchased by big multinational corporations,

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.379
where the marketing professionals were consulted
before many products were fully developed.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:15.700
That strategy trickled down, and by the mid-1980s
the in-house marketing departments of places

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.540
like Paramount, Warner Brothers, and 20th
Century Fox began weighing in on which films

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.180
should actually get made.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.870
Studios like Marvel have taken this to a whole
new level, staking out release dates and creating

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.960
promotional material for movies before they’ve
developed a script, hired actors, or picked

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960
a director.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.270
Meanwhile, sponsorships and product placements
have existed in some form since the dawn of

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.040
movies, but in the 1980s, they reached a whole
new level.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.680
Companies like Coca-Cola or Frito-Lay would
pay to have their products featured in movies

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.900
aimed at an audience they hope to reach.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.900
And it often worked!

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.590
For instance, after Hershey’s agreed to
spend $1 million marketing Stephen Spielberg’s

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.840
E.T. in exchange for a prominent use of Reese’s
Pieces in the film, sales of the candy jumped

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.680
by a whopping 65% in just two weeks!

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.760
And the Internet has revolutionized movie
marketing in many ways.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.120
Not only is it cheaper to deliver trailers
over the web, but marketing departments can

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.040
now target their material to very specific
audiences.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.420
And savvy use of social media can amplify
the marketing team’s message.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.520
So rather than paying to advertise on every
major television network, the marketing team

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.270
of a new animated film can aim ads directly
at, say, people whose browser histories indicate

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.300
that they have young kids.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.480
Now, when you’re marketing a film, first
you’ll have to figure out how much you’ll

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.600
need to spend.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.880
Generally speaking, marketing costs about
an additional quarter to a half of a film’s budget.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.590
So if you’ve made a new comic book movie
for $150 million, you might have to spend

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.580
another $75 million to make sure people know
it’s coming out.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.670
And the problem is, now your movie has to
make $225 million just to break even!

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:38.800
So where does all that money go?

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.640
Well, the biggest chunk of a marketing budget
falls under something called Prints and Advertising,

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:43.860
or P&amp;A.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.060
Marketing departments will often buy print
ad space in local newspapers and on billboards,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.550
advertise on the radio, or make a series of
teasers and trailers.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.140
And depending on /how/ you release your film,
the cost of P&amp;A can change.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.150
Each of these avenues has different marketing
requirements, expenses, and strategies.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.500
A theatrical release is generally pricier.

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.120
The film itself has to be physically delivered
to theaters – which used to cost more when

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.290
that meant hauling around heavy metal cans
full of physical film.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.630
But there are benefits, too.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.430
There’s still some prestige attached to
having your film play in a movie theater.

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.920
And films have to have at least a small theatrical
release to be eligible for major awards like

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.180
the Oscars, for instance.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.870
And if you make a big enough marketing splash
when your film opens in theaters, by the time

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.740
it comes out on other platforms, people might
remember hearing about it.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.050
Other films find release on cable television.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.970
Marketing these films is somewhat less expensive,
and the audience is easier to find –

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.460
because they're already watching the channel!

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.310
Channels like HBO, Showtime, and even the
History Channel have produced and distributed

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.080
movies and miniseries to great success in
recent years.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.780
Then, there are paid streaming services like
Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.180
They not only distribute films that have had
a theatrical run, but also let you stream

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.870
original movies on your television, tablet,
or phone whenever and wherever you want.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.890
These companies know more about who their
audience is than anyone else.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.840
They know what you’ve watched before, what
you’ve searched for, and what you might

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.460
be interested in seeing next.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.980
This level of detail is a dream for movie
marketing executives… and a little bit

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.560
creepy if you think about it too much.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.300
Some movies get released on free streaming
services, like YouTube or Vimeo.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.110
These films often aim their marketing materials
at prominent users of a platform, hoping that

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:14.830
someone with a few million followers will
spread the word about their movie.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.500
This kind of marketing can be less expensive,
but more time-consuming.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.780
Movies also get released on home video formats
like DVD and Blu-ray, and by film festivals,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.120
both live and online.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.390
Some movies use a successful film festival
run to market their films to buyers – distribution

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.730
companies who will then release the film theatrically
or through video-on-demand.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:36.550
These distribution companies, from the major
studios to independent companies like A24

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.640
or Magnolia Pictures, will use their expertise
and infrastructure to execute a marketing

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.170
strategy and help the film find its audience.

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:47.070
Film festivals also offer movies a chance
to be seen by critics, whose reviews can boost

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.640
interest in a film and provide marketing departments
with quotes they can put on the posters and

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.640
DVD art.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.889
Needless to say, different kinds of movies
aimed at different audiences require very

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:56.990
different marketing and distribution strategies.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.530
And while a film’s success relies on more
than just its marketing, every film does

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:01.590
need to find its audience.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.360
For big-budget movies with a theatrical release,
the opening weekend box office is key to their success.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.750
The money and good press from a big opening
weekend can lead all the way to massive home

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.800
video sales, successful sequels, and even
theme park rides.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.150
So there’s a lot riding on the marketing
departments of major studios to get people

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.280
buying tickets for their films right out of
the gate.

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.080
They have some help, because many huge Hollywood
movies are based on characters or stories

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.530
that people are familiar with.

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.590
Sequels, prequels, and reboots, oh my!

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.430
Since audiences are already pre-aware of these
stories, the job of the marketing department

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:33.700
is to use tools like trailers, posters, commercials,
or talk show appearances to make people want

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.710
to see these movies right away.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.310
Big-budget marketing efforts create a vicious
cycle, though, since the high cost of a national

00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.459
campaign means the film has to make even more
money at the box office to break even.

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:47.600
Smaller, independent movies don’t have the
resources to throw 100 million dollars into

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.649
marketing, but they don’t necessarily need
to.

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:53.149
These movies are often made for much less
money, so they don’t need to break box office

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:56.009
records on their opening weekend to be a success
and pay back investors.

00:08:56.009 --> 00:09:00.559
So whether you’ve made the latest Marvel
movie or a DIY indie on your cell phone, marketing

00:09:00.559 --> 00:09:04.120
is an essential piece of the filmmaking puzzle
when it comes to finding an audience and getting

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.569
them excited to see your film.

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:08.809
Today we talked about the history of marketing,
from the earliest days through innovative

00:09:08.809 --> 00:09:10.360
online campaigns.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.050
We looked at the ways marketing professionals
use things like posters, trailers, and celebrity

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:16.480
interviews to drive awareness of films.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.120
And we explored the costs and benefits of
various strategies for marketing large-scale

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.689
blockbusters versus micro-budget indies.

00:09:22.689 --> 00:09:26.240
Next time we’ll spend some time exploring
that age old question: should you go to film

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.449
school, or not?

00:09:27.449 --> 00:09:31.140
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.620
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest shows, like

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.930
Deep Look, Eons, and Infinite Series.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.499
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
