00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.540
‘Mise-en-scene’ literally means “placing
on stage.”

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.410
But in film, mise-en-scene encompasses everything
the camera is capturing.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.980
It’s the set and how it’s lit.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.539
It’s how the subjects are framed.

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.840
It’s the actors and how they look and what
they’re wearing.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.840
It’s the props they’re holding and the
set dressing they’re moving through.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.740
Just as every line of dialogue and every shot
should be helping to move the film forward,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.210
everything in frame should be helping to build
the mise-en-scene.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.120
From the overall look and feel of the sets,
to the details in makeup on the actors’

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.720
faces, everything in a film is designed and
captured for a reason.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:45.839
[Intro Muic Plays]

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.149
Sometimes mise-en-scene is pretty obvious:
think of the German expressionist film The

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.170
Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, or any film by Tim
Burton or Wes Anderson.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.729
These films are clearly stylized -- the audience
can tell that the sets, costumes, and makeup

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.160
were all created and crafted by someone.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.400
But sometimes the mise-en-scene is more subtle,
like in the realist film Winter’s Bone,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.510
or films by Lynne Ramsay or Kelly Reichardt.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.090
The world portrayed in realist films might
make the audience wonder what a production

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.530
designer even did to build the world, because
the scenes look so much like the world we

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.530
live in.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.060
But look carefully at the world of a realist
film.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.800
Just as the cinematographer uses the language
of the camera to help tell the story, the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.060
teams creating the mise-en-scene structure
the set and the actors in specific ways to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.549
bring the director’s vision to life.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.530
The production designer creates the physical
world of the film.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.840
This person leads the art department, which
builds and decorates the sets.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.850
Early in pre-production, the production designer
is hired to work with the director to develop

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.409
the look of the film.

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.720
Depending on when and where the script is
set, they’ll probably have to research what

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.130
to include, and exclude, when building their
world.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.679
For example, I was in a film that took place
in the 1970s, and there was a scene shot next

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.880
to a building with corrugated metal siding.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.110
Because of his experience and research, the
production designer knew that the shape of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.930
that metal corrugation wasn’t developed
until the 1980s.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.229
So to make the scene accurate to the time,
he had the art department bring in old corrugated

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.880
metal and hung it over the new metal.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.039
This might seem silly.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.190
I mean who, besides the production designer,
is going to know what year corrugated metal

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.240
changed shape?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.300
But, even if we don’t know the year, subconsciously
we feel the differences.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.890
Imagine a scene in a classroom from your childhood.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.860
If you grew up in the 1990s and a film about
your childhood years included students writing

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.540
on chalk slates or if you grew up in the 1960s
and the film included a smart board, both

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.730
those things would feel wrong.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.390
So, as soon as the production designer gets
the script, they begin researching the time

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.980
period and the location where the story takes
place, to get the feeling just right.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.500
It might even be a time period in the future
or a make-believe place.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.900
But they still start with research.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.390
After that, the production designer prepares
plans and drawings for the sets that need

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.390
to be built.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.610
And they go on early location scouts with
the director so they can begin planning how

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.720
they’ll use a location.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.640
Then they’ll present the director with their
ideas for designing the setting.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.990
Once they’ve agreed upon a plan with the
director, the art department gets to work.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.190
They work with the set decorator, also called
a scenic designer, to research and implement

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.780
every detail they’ll bring into the world
of the film.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.820
While the production designer is creating
the look of the film overall, the set decorator

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.340
is choosing the details and designing the
sets.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.600
The production designer also works with the
art director to budget and organize the department.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600
They hire buyers who buy or rent set dressing
and props.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.150
Once the set is designed, the art department
builds anything that doesn’t already exist

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.990
for the set itself, as well as any special
props that are needed.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:25.060
The art department masterminds what the physical
world of the story looks like, but if the

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.240
characters don’t look and feel like they
belong in that world, then it’s all for nothing.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.280
The costume designer and the wardrobe department,
along with the hair and makeup departments,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.040
also play pivotal roles in creating the mise-en-scene.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.280
And the work of any designer starts, again,
with research.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.360
The costume designer uses pre-production to
study the setting and the time period, including

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.970
the season when the film takes place.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.270
The costume designer’s most important job,
though, is to understand the characters and

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.890
how they grow throughout the film.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.820
By developing a signature look for a character,
the designer can help convey the story’s

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.960
plot and themes.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.150
Maggie Smith plays both Professor McGonagall
in the Harry Potter series, and Miss Shepherd

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.420
in The Lady in the Van -- two very different
characters with different backstories and

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.420
goals.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.070
The wardrobe of the character can convey more
about them than their opening lines.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.710
And as characters change over the course of
the story, that change is often shown outwardly

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.840
-- and not just in makeover montages.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.820
In Jurassic World, for example, Bryce Dallas
Howard’s character Claire starts out in

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.100
nearly all white clothes, implying that she
never is outside with the dinosaurs and is

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.600
disconnected from the reality of the park
she works in.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.180
But the costume designer played with what
the audience already knew of the original

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.901
Jurassic Park, and mapped out Claire’s wardrobe
changes to quote those of Laura Dern’s character

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:36.960
from the 1993 film.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.620
That way, she becomes more connected with
the story and thus more capable in our minds.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.790
Design decisions like this help the audience
get pulled into the film, but they also help

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.090
the actors get into the minds of their characters.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.900
The director Tom Ford, who started his career
in the fashion industry, has even sewn labels

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.560
into his actors’ costumes so that they never
feel like costumes, but like the characters’

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560
clothes themselves.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.340
This extra detail isn’t something the camera
or the audience will ever see, but when your

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.460
job as an actor is to believe in a pretend
world while you’re surrounded by crew and

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.660
lights, it makes the world a little more real
and your job a little easier.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.130
This is true not just of the clothes actors
wear, but also the makeup they use and how

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:15.130
their hair is styled.

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.840
Hair and Makeup, or HMU, are usually referred
to as a single unit on set, and they often

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.290
share a trailer, but they’re two separate,
specialized careers.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.590
As with production and costume designers,
pre-production is all about research and planning.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.230
Hairdressers work with the director to develop
how they’ll style the actors’ hair.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.750
They’ll prep any dyes, wigs, extensions,
or bald caps they might need.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.340
Because films are rarely shot in order, hairstylists
need to be organized and plan how to maintain

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.750
continuity throughout the film.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.000
This is often a reason wigs are used instead
of dying hair.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.460
If scheduling demands that an actor play a
grey-haired version of their character on

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.980
either side of a dark-haired version, for
example, then it can be easier to work with

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:52.710
wigs than back-to-back dying.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.030
And making a wig look just as realistic as
real hair can be tricky.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.120
If it’s a period piece, they’ll need to
know how to create a time-appropriate look,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.370
but with the safety and health standards of
the current times.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.580
This is true for makeup artists, too.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.450
Makeup artists need to understand each actor’s
skin and create a plan that keeps the actor

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.389
as comfortable as possible while also creating
the look the film demands.

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.919
Makeup is similar to lighting or editing,
in that it usually has to be seen, but not

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:16.919
noticed.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.080
Whether you’re making a beautiful person
camera ready, or building a look out of latex

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.020
and airbrushing, the audience needs to be
connecting with the character and their internal

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.180
life, not getting distracted by their makeup.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.050
Some makeup artists specialize in special
effects makeup.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.190
But all makeup artists need to know how to
create certain illusions, like cuts, bruises,

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.790
scars, bad teeth, and tattoos.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:39.110
Of all the departments on set, makeup, hair,
and wardrobe spend the most time with the

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.110
actors.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:43.580
Each department has a trailer at basecamp,
but will also send a representative to set

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:44.580
with the actors.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:48.940
When the 1st AD calls “Last looks,” they’re
telling these three people to check the actors’

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.419
makeup, hair, and clothing to make sure it’s
camera ready.

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.180
It’s their job to make sure the actors don’t
have to think about these things and can focus

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.270
on their work of being present in the scene.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.250
And of course, all the designers working on
a film need to communicate between departments

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.639
to create the mise-en-scene and help tell
the story.

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.980
A really bright example of how this can all
come together is the character Clementine,

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.620
in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.790
The costume designer, hair and makeup team,
and the production designer worked together

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.650
to make the audience associate the color orange
with Clementine.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.590
Whether it’s her hair color or her bright
orange sweatshirt, they took inspiration from

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.580
her name and the script and brought it into
the mise-en-scene.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.930
And if you pay close attention, they give
us a big hint about the end of the movie by

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.070
aligning her character with that color.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.530
That movie came out over ten years ago, so
I don’t think I’m spoiling anything by

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.010
saying that it’s about removing the memory
of Clementine from the brain of her ex boyfriend,

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.010
Joel.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.900
The costume designer and the set decorator
took great care in making everything in Joel’s

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.590
world appear in greys and blues.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.070
But, when Joel wakes up from having his memory
erased, everything in the scene is grey or

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.500
blue except one orange vase.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.960
Like every real character we come to love
in our favorite movies, Clementine isn’t

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.060
completely erased.

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:57.830
Today we discussed the teams that play the
biggest roles in creating the mise-en-scene

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:58.830
of a film.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:02.520
We talked about how the art department creates
the world the film takes place in, and how

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.910
the wardrobe department interprets the character
and the story through their clothes.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.570
And we learned how the hair and makeup departments
transform the actors into their characters

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.570
on screen.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.550
Next time, we’ll talk about Grip and Electric,
one of the largest crews on a set and the

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:16.630
teams that add that final touch of the mise-en-scene:
lights.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.900
