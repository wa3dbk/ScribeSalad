You know what can make even the most entertaining
YouTube video really frustrating?

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.040
Bad sound.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.880
That is, for audiences who don't rely on closed captioning.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.570
Like, what if my voice was all garbled with
static, or if my words weren’t synced up

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.789
to the video right now?

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:16.789
Annoying, right?

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.380
You might look away from a screen if the visuals
are jarring, but you pretty much always hear

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.700
a film – whether it’s dialogue that was
recorded on set, or a sweeping score added

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.700
in post-production.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.420
And the sad thing is: you don’t often notice
really good sound recording and design.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.380
Even though it takes just as much technical
know-how and artistry as visual storytelling does.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.520
When sound production is most successful,
you’re not thinking about the quality of

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.550
the sound at all.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.550
You’re feeling it.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.380
You’re pulled into the story and living
in the world of the film.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:53.980
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.040
Let’s start with the basics: the audience
is gonna want to hear the characters they’re watching.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.719
And that all starts with the sound department
on set, which is usually a small crew of two

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:02.719
to three people.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.170
Its head is the Sound Mixer, also known as
the Production Sound Mixer, Location Sound

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.030
Recordist, Sound Engineer, or just the “sound
guy.”

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.030
This person usually supplies all the sound
equipment for the production, and is responsible

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.890
for recording all the sounds on set.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.110
Every space has unique acoustics, so a good
sound mixer will try to record as much as

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.740
possible to make the world of the film feel
real.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.120
That includes the sounds actors make in the
scene being filmed – like dialogue...

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.600
Batman: Where's Dent?
Joker: Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.280
Joker: But I know the truth. There's no going back.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.860
Joker: You've changed things... forever.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.920
...slurping their tea...

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.900
[slurp]

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.120
...or foot stomps as they jog down
a street.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:56.420
[footsteps as Marion chases Indy]

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.320
Plus, it includes wild sound, which is any
extra lines that are said or noises that are

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.799
intentionally created without the camera
rolling, to be added into the movie in post-production.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:10.119
And lastly there’s room tone, the atmospheric
sound in a space filled with silent actors,

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.730
crew, and set dressing.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.290
Having room tone helps the sound editors make
the world feel authentic and consistent.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.180
The sound department’s second-in-command
on set is the boom operator, or boom op, for short.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.080
This is the person you’ll see holding a
microphone on a long boom pole out over the actors.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.460
Actors will often have small body mics, also known as lavalier mics,

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.840
This is mine... it's not hidden.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.860
But the boom op is working to capture sound
from everyone and everything in each scene.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.900
To do their job well, they have to really
know the script and the blocking, or how the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.780
actors will physically move through a scene.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.190
That way, they can position the boom in the
best place to pick up sound, while keeping

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.410
the mic and its shadow out of the camera’s
view.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.480
On larger sets, there might be a third person
on the sound crew: the utility sound technician,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.280
also known as the second assistant sound.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.800
This person helps with a bunch of stuff, like:
equipment maintenance, mic placement, cable

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.930
management, keeping everyone quiet while filming,
or even operating a second boom.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.560
Now, I already mentioned the two main mics
you’ll find on a film set: the boom mic

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560
and the body mic.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.250
But you have to think about a lot more than
just where you put a microphone.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.770
When you’re speaking, you’re pushing air
through your vocal folds out into the world.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.620
That vibrates other air molecules, making
sound waves.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.090
So, microphones nearly always have a windscreen
to help record clean sound, and not just loud,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.420
whooshing noises from the air.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.160
It muffles air being blown directly at it
without affecting the mic’s ability to pick up sound.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.680
A small windscreen is usually enough on an
enclosed set, or on a soundstage, like this one.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.750
Outdoors, you might need more intense windscreens.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.650
And here’s a perfect example of how great
film crews are at naming things:

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.560
The big ones are called dead cats… because,
well, just look at them.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.890
The sound department not only has to make
sure they’re recording good sound, but they

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.700
have to pay close attention to what they don’t
want to capture.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.610
And they can do that with microphone patterns.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.050
A microphone pattern is a shape around a mic
where it picks up sound best, and there are

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.340
a few standard types.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.849
Just like the camera department has to change
lenses, the sound department might have to

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.660
change mics from scene to scene.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.590
First, you have omni-directional mics, meaning
the mic is recording sound coming at it from

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.590
every direction.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.610
There are a lot of situations where this is
ideal, like for recording a conversation where

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.440
people are sitting and talking all around
a table.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.480
But on a set, you only want to hear the actors
on camera, and not all the crew behind the scenes.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.660
So this mic wouldn’t be the best choice.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.699
Bidirectional mics pick up sound directly
in front of and behind them, while rejecting

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.319
sound coming from the sides.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:24.960
Their sensitivity pattern looks kind of like
a figure 8.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.669
These mics are useful for interviews or duets
– any time when two people are directly

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.560
across from each other, with the mic in the
middle.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.940
Then, there are cardioid mics, named because
their pattern is kind of shaped like a heart.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.569
They pick up more sound in the direction you’re
pointing them, plus a little bit from behind

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:39.569
and on the sides.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.150
A cardioid pattern is good for recording lines
from one person at a time, up close.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.159
So lavalier mics – the ones physically attached
to actors – are usually cardioid or omnidirectional.

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.680
If you want something a little wider than
a typical cardioid, but not as wide as an

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.020
omnidirectional, there are subcardioid mics.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.550
Or, say you’re trying to record a conversation
where a bunch of people are huddled together

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.520
and talking.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.820
So you have several mics near each other,
and you want each one to only pick up one person.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.599
In this case, a supercardioid or hypercardioid
might be your best options, because they have

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.159
even more directional pickup.

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.099
But the downside is that they also have more
sensitivity directly behind them, so they

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.630
can pick up things you don’t want to hear
in the final film, like chatter from the crew.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.119
If you need something even more directional,
like for the end of a boom pole, you can put

00:05:20.119 --> 00:05:24.479
something called an interference tube over
a supercardioid or a hypercardioid mic.

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:29.060
This ideally makes unwanted sound waves from
the sides cancel out, and creates a lobar

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.099
pattern: you can aim them more precisely,
and pick up sound from farther away.

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:36.250
Because these mics are long and narrow, they’re
called shotgun mics.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.089
So on a typical set, there’s probably a
shotgun mic on the boom pole, and a handful

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.810
of lavaliers on different actors or hosts.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.529
Each of those microphones is picking up part
of the overall sound in a scene, and each

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.469
one feeds into its own track on the audio
recorder where the sound mixer is.

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.349
There, the sound mixer can adjust the mic
sensitivity and the recording levels.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.360
So in the final film, the audience can hear
a soft whisper...

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.600
Gandalf: Fly you fools.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600
...and understand loud shouting.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.440
Stansfield: Benny? Bring me everyone.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.360
Benny: What do you mean, "everyone?"

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.280
Stansfield: EVERYONE!!!

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.149
And 
all this is just production sound!

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.690
We still have a whole world of post-production
to explore.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.969
Before editing anything, the very first thing
you need to do is sync the sound with the

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:23.969
camera footage.

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.349
And if you prepare during production, it’s
pretty easy to do.

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:27.619
Remember the 2nd AC?

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.740
They’re responsible for the slate, which
marks each take with both a visual and an

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.740
audio cue.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.809
To help keep track of media, the scene, shot,
and take number are written on the slate for

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:39.960
the camera to see, and are called out for
the microphone to hear.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.490
Nick: Scene 21 take 25!

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.680
And then, the 2nd AC claps the slate shut.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.520
If you don’t have a slate, you can clap
your hands in front of the camera and the

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:49.710
mic to get the same effect.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:50.710
[clap]

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.969
The goal is to make the audio levels spike,
while the camera catches the exact moment

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:56.039
the clapper and the board of the slate come
together.

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.240
That way, in post-production, you can manually
match up that audio and visual cue and...

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240
voilà!

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240
Your sound is synced.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.939
If you want a faster way of syncing audio
and video, we’ve got you covered too.

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:08.360
One way is through a timecode sync, if you’re
using a digital slate.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.169
The moment the clapper hits the board, a signal
is sent from the slate to the camera and the

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:13.169
audio recorder.

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:16.830
And the timecode of this exact moment is recorded
on both devices, which you can use to sync

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.830
everything up.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.440
The second way is if your camera is recording
audio too, which won’t be used in the final

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.009
mix, called a guide track.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.840
That way, in your editing software, you have
your video footage, camera sound, and sound

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.199
from the audio recorder.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:31.259
And an audio waveform sync program can match
them all up.

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:35.179
Typically, an assistant editor syncs up the
sound with the visuals, and then the editing

00:07:35.179 --> 00:07:36.789
team cuts together the film.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.520
Once the film editor and director agree on
a picture lock, meaning the visual and story

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.480
edit of the film is finalized, it’s time
for the post-production sound team to get to work.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:49.160
Like the film editor, the sound editor makes
decisions based on things like story and the

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:50.169
actor performances.

00:07:50.169 --> 00:07:53.449
The best takes for camera aren’t always
the best takes for sound, though, technically

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:54.889
or artistically.

00:07:54.889 --> 00:07:58.360
And it’s up to the sound editor to make
sure the best sound takes for the film make

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.469
it into the final mix.

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:03.009
On a bigger film, some sound editors will
be dedicated dialogue editors.

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:06.949
Like the name suggests, their job is to cut
for the best dialogue from production sound.

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:10.060
Ideally, the audio and video from the same
take will both be great.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.239
That makes their job easy.

00:08:11.239 --> 00:08:15.649
Often though, the dialogue editor has to borrow
sound from other takes or wild sound, and

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:18.339
sync the best takes for sound with the best
takes for camera.

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:21.969
This only works if the audience can’t tell
it’s been done, like if the camera is on

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:25.529
another character, so it takes a lot of skill
and creative editing.

00:08:25.529 --> 00:08:29.340
If there’s not a great sound take, the crew
will bring actors back into a studio and do

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.229
some Automated Dialogue Replacement, or ADR.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:33.839
Some actors relish ADR.

00:08:33.839 --> 00:08:37.979
Meryl Streep famously loves it because mixing
separate visual and audio performances can

00:08:37.979 --> 00:08:40.659
add complexity to what her character is conveying.

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.889
Of course, dialogue isn’t the only sound
in a film.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:46.620
Sound Designers work with sound mixers and
foley artists to create the sound effects

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:50.020
that make the world of the film feel rich
and whole, from birds chirping

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.620
to the *pew pew* of lasers.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.120
And music supervisors and composers work with
the director to either curate or create the

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.120
music of the film.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.940
Adding music frequently comes at the end of
post-production.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.360
And when it’s done well, it’s the finishing
touch that solidifies the entire film and

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.380
brings it to life.

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.910
From an actor’s whispered lines to the final
score woven throughout a film, sound helps

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.279
us go from watching a story with relatable
characters, to feeling what they feel and

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.420
living in their world.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.910
Today we learned about all the artists involved
in production sound, and how different microphone

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:20.690
patterns are best for different situations.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.810
We talked about the importance of post-production
sound and the role it plays in deepening our

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.089
experience of a film, and making the movie
the best it can be.

00:09:28.089 --> 00:09:31.790
Next time, we’ll talk about the people who
see everything, from the bigger picture to

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.610
tiny details that could get overlooked on
a film set: producers.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.920

association with PBS Digital Studios.
