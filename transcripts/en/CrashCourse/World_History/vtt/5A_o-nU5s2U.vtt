Hi, I’m John Green. This is Crash Course
World History. And apparently it’s Revolutions

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.060
Month here at Crash Course, because today
we are going to discuss the often-neglected

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.800
Haitian Revolutions. The Haitian Revolutions
are totally fascinating and they involve two

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.000
of my very favorite things:
1. Ending slavery, and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.760
2. Napoleon getting his feelings hurt. I can’t
help myself, Napoleon. I like to see you suffer.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:30.600
[theme music]

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.360
So, the French colony in Saint-Domingue began
in the 17th century as a pirate outpost. And

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.540
its original French inhabitants made their
living selling leather and a kind of smoked

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.020
beef called boucan. All that beef actually
came from cattle left behind by the Spanish,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.260
who were the first Europeans to settle the
island.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.090
But anyway, after 1640, the boucan-sellers
started to run low on beef. And they were

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.960
like, “You know what would pay better than
selling beef jerky? Robbing Spanish galleons,”

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.980
which as you’ll recall were loaded with
silver mined from South America. So, by the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.469
middle of the 17th century, the French had
convinced many of those buccaneering captains

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.389
to give up their pirating and settle on the
island.

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.540
Many of them invested some of their pirate
treasure in sugar plantations, which, by 1700

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.840
were thriving at both producing sugar and
working people to death. And soon, this island

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.789
was the most valuable colony in the West Indies,
and possibly in the world. It produced 40%

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.600
of Europe’s sugar, 60% of its coffee, and it was
home to more slaves than any place except Brazil.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.500
And as you’ll recall from our discussion
of Atlantic slavery, being a slave in a sugar-production

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.520
colony was exceptionally brutal. In fact,
by the late 18th century, more slaves were

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.520
imported to Saint-Domingue EVERY YEAR— more
than 40,000— than the entire white population

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.009
of the island. By the 19th century, slaves
made up about 90% of the population.

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.169
And most of those slaves were African born,
because the brutal living and working conditions

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:50.349
prevented natural population growth. Like,
remember Alfred Crosby’s fantastic line,

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:54.859
“it is crudely true that if man’s caloric
intake is sufficient, he will somehow stagger

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.469
to maturity, and he will reproduce?” Yeah,
well, not in 18th century Haiti, thanks to

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.259
Yellow Fever and smallpox and just miserable
working conditions. So, most of these plantations

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.959
were pretty large, they often had more than
200 slaves, and many of the field workers—

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.209
in some cases, a majority— were women.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.860
Colonial society in Saint-Domingue was divided
into four groups, which had important consequences

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.069
for the revolution. At the top, were the Big
White planters who owned the plantations and

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.829
all the slaves. Often these Grand Blancs were
absentee landlords who would just rather stay

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.730
in France and let their agents do, you know,
the actual brutality.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.140
Below them were the wealthy free people of
color. Most of the Frenchmen who came to the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.540
island were, you know, men, and they frequently
fathered children with slave women. These

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.549
fathers would often free their children. Wasn’t
that generous of them. So, by 1789, there

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.920
were 24,800 free people of color along with
about 30,000 white people in the colony. The

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.120
free people of color contributed a lot to
the island’s stability. They served in the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.209
militia, and in the local constabulary, and
many of the wealthier ones eventually owned

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.030
plantations and slaves of their own.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.940
And then, below them on the social ladder were
the poor whites, or the petit blancs, who worked

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.840
as artisans and laborers. And at the bottom were
the slaves who made up the overwhelming majority.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.409
I know what you’re thinking: this is a recipe
for permanent social stability. No, it wasn’t.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.290
Okay, so when the French Revolution broke
out in 1789, all these groups had something

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.280
to complain about. The slaves, obviously,
disliked being slaves. The free people of

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.469
color were still subject to legal discrimination,
no matter how wealthy they became.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.959
And the poor whites, in addition to being
poor, were resentful of all the privileges

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.109
held by the wealthy people of color. And the
Grand Blancs were complaining about French

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.030
trade laws and the government’s attempts
to slightly improve the living and working

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.989
conditions of slaves. Basically they were
saying that government shouldn’t be in the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:35.379
business of regulating business. So everyone
was unhappy, but the slaves were by far the worst off.

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.799
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! You’re always saying
how much slavery sucks, but is it really any

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.299
worse than having to work for, like, subsis...

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.620
Yeah, I’m gonna stop you right there, Me
from the Past, before you further embarrass

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.829
yourself. You often hear from people attempting
to comprehend the horrors of slavery that

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.340
slavery couldn’t have been all that bad,
and that it wasn’t that different from working

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.389
for minimum wage. And that we know this because
if it HAD been so bad, slaves would have just

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.840
revolted, which they never did. Yeah. Well,
1. equating slavery to poor working conditions

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.480
ignores the fact that if you work at, like,
Foxconn, Foxconn doesn’t get to sell your

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.040
children to other corporations. And
2. As you are about to see, SLAVES DID REVOLT.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.400
So, the unrest in what became Haiti started
in 1789 when some slaves heard a rumor that

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.379
the King of France had freed them. Even though
it was across the ocean, word of the changes

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.280
in France reached the people of Haiti, where
The Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen,

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.949
while terrifying to planters, gave hope both
to free people of color and to slaves.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.729
At the same time, some petit blancs argued
that there was inadequate discrimination against

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.210
blacks. They identified with the third estate
in France, and they called for interest rates

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.000
to be lowered so they could more easily pay their debts.
And they began lobbying for colonial independence.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.580
The psychology here shows you the extent to
which slaves were not considered people. I

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.610
mean, these radical petit blancs thought that
they were the oppressed people in Saint-Domingue

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.360
because they couldn’t afford to own slaves.
And they thought if they could become independent

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.419
from France, they could take power from the
people of privilege and institute a democracy

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.500
where everyone had a voice-- except for the
95% of people who weren’t white.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.610
Then in 1791, these radical petit blancs seized
the city of Port-au-Prince. You’ll remember

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.830
that by 1791, France was at war with most
of Europe, and just like with the 7 Years’

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.960
War, the wars of Revolutionary France played
out in the colonies as well as at home. So

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.060
the French government sent troops to Saint-Domingue.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.690
Meanwhile, urges toward liberty, fraternity,
and equality were only growing in France,

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.960
and it didn’t seem very equitable to grant
citizenship based solely on race. So in May

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.940
of 1791, the National Assembly gave full French
citizenship to all free men of color. I mean,

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.460
if they owned property, and had enough money,
and weren’t the children of slaves. The

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.629
petit blancs weren’t thrilled about this,
and that led to fighting breaking out between

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.389
them and the newly French free people of color.

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:42.039
And then in August of 1791, the slaves were
like, “Um, hi, yes. Screw all of you.”

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.759
And a massive slave revolt broke out. Among
the leaders of this revolt was Toussaint Breda,

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.660
a former slave of full African descent, who later
took the name Toussaint L’ouverture. L’Ouverture

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.980
helped mold the slaves into a disciplined army
that could withstand attacks from the French troops.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.360
But again, the context of the wider revolution
proves really important here. So, the Spanish

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.580
had consistently supported slave revolts in
Saint-Domingue hoping to weaken the French.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.759
But, by 1793 they were offering even more
support. In fact, L’Ouverture became an

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.839
officer in the Spanish military because the
emancipation of the slaves was more important

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.379
to him than maintaining his rights as a French
Citizen.

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.580
So then, in October of 1793 the British, whom
as I’m sure you’ll recall were also at

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.169
war with France, decided to invade Saint-Domingue.
And at that point, the French military commanders

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:28.099
were like, We are definitely going to lose
this war if we fight the British, the Spanish,

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.860
and the slaves, so let’s free the slaves.
So they issued decrees freeing the slaves

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.750
and on February 4, 1794 the National Convention
in Paris ratified those decrees.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.030
By May, having learned of the Convention’s
actions, L’Ouverture switched allegiances

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.949
to the French and turned the tide of the war.
Thus, the most successful slave revolt in

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.349
human history won freedom and citizenship
for every slave in the French Caribbean. But

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:53.259
emancipation didn’t end the story because
the French were still at war with the Spanish

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.860
and the English in Saint-Domingue. Luckily
for France, L’Ouverture was an excellent

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.330
general, and luckily for the people of the
island, L’Ouverture was also an able politician.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.470
And between 1794 and 1802, he successfully
steered the colony toward independence.

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.970
So, although slavery was abolished, this didn’t
end the plantation system because both L’Ouverture

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:14.979
and his compatriot André Rigaud believed
that sugar was vital to the economic health

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.599
of the island. But now at least people were
paid for their labor and their kids couldn’t

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:21.349
be sold. Now you can compare it to Foxconn.

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:24.569
But soon, L’Ouverture and Rigaud came into
conflict over Rigaud’s refusal to give up

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:28.509
control over one of the Southern states on
the island, and there was a civil war, which

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:32.879
L’Ouverture, with the help of his able lieutenant
Jacques Dessalines, was able to win after

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:36.229
13 months of hard fighting. L’Ouverture
then passed a new constitution, and things

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:40.940
were going pretty well on Saint-Domingue with
the small problem that it was still technically part of

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.380
France, which meant that it was about to be ruled by
Napoleon Bonaparte. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.860
So, in 1799, Napoleon seized power in France
in a coup. And, his new regime, called the

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:54.509
Consulate (because he was the First Consul
à la the Roman Republic) established a new

00:07:54.509 --> 00:08:00.759
constitution that specifically pointed out its
laws did not apply to France’s overseas colonies.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:05.500
Napoleon had plans to reconstruct France’s
empire in North America that it had lost most

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.509
of in the 7 Years’ War, and to do this he
needed tons of money from France’s most

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:15.849
valuable colony, Saint-Domingue. And the best
way to maximize profits? Why, to reintroduce

00:08:15.849 --> 00:08:19.629
slavery, of course. That’s certainly what
the former slaves thought was the plan when

00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:25.539
in 1802, a French expedition commanded by
Napoleon’s brother in-law Charles-Victor-Emmanuel

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:28.499
“I-Have-Too-Many-Names” Leclerc showed
up in Saint-Domingue.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.640
This started the second phase of the Haitian
revolution, the fight for independence. So,

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:36.440
Leclerc eventually had L’Ouverture arrested
and shipped to France where he died in prison

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.080
in 1803. But this itself did not spark an
uprising against the French because L’Ouverture

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.820
wasn’t actually that popular, largely because he wanted
most blacks on the island to continue to grow sugar.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.760
Instead, the former slaves only started fighting
when Leclerc tried to take away their guns,

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.260
thus beginning a guerrilla war that the French,
despite their superior training and weapons,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.320
had absolutely no chance of winning. Although
the French were exceedingly cruel, executing

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.510
women as well as men and importing man-eating
dogs from Cuba, the Haitians had the best

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:10.500
ally of all: Disease, specifically in the
form of Yellow Fever, which killed thousands

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.880
of French soldiers, including Leclerc himself.
Oh, it’s time for the Open Letter?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:22.160
Stan! Where is my chair? Stan, you’re telling
me the yellow chair has been lost? The yellow

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:29.100
chair is the star of the show. The stars,
in order, are 1. me, 2. yellow chair, 3. the

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.940
chalkboard, 4. Danica, 5. Meredith the Intern,
6. you, Stan. You’re sixth. Oh, I’m mad.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.000
Let’s see what’s in the secret compartment
today. It’s a giant squid of anger!!! I’M

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.440
A GIANT SQUID OF ANGER!!!! Oh, no. It broke.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.100
An open letter to disease. Dear disease, why do you
always put yourself at the center of human history?

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:52.080
Most of you are just tiny, little single-celled
organisms, but you’re so self-important

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:56.310
and self-involved that you’re always interfering
with us. Admittedly, sometimes you work for

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.520
the good guys, but usually you don’t. It
seems like even though you’re constantly

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.280
interfering with human history, you don’t
even care about it.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.560
I just hate when people, and also microbes,
are super self-involved. Like, don’t tell

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.610
me you gotta take a day off to go to your
mom’s birthday party, Stan. That’s not

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.830
imagining me complexly. I’ve got needs over
here.

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:13.380
Best wishes, John Green.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.520
So continued defeat and the death of his troops
eventually convinced Napoleon to give up his

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:22.620
dreams of an American empire and cut his losses.
He recalled his surviving troops, of the 40,000

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.900
who left, only 8,000 made it back. And then,
he sold Thomas Jefferson Louisiana. And that

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.400
is how former slaves in Haiti gave America
all of this.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.160
On January 1, 1804, Dessalines who had defeated
the French, declared the island of Saint-Domingue

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.540
independent and re-named it Haiti, which is
what the island had been called by the native

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.170
inhabitants before the arrival of Columbus.
The Haitian Declaration of Independence was

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.950
a rejection of France and, to a certain degree
of European racism and colonialism.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:54.260
It also affirmed, to quote from the book Slave
Revolution in the Caribbean, “a broad definition

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.320
of the new country as a refuge for enslaved
peoples of all kinds.” So, why is this little

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:03.380
island so important that we would devote an
entire episode to it? First, Haiti was the

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:07.150
second free and independent nation state in
the Americas. It also had one of the most

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.240
successful slave revolts ever. Haiti became
the first modern nation to be governed by

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:16.540
people of African descent, and they also foiled
Napoleon’s attempts to build a big new world empire

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.490
Of course, Haiti’s history since its revolution
has been marred by tragedy, a legacy of the

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.990
loss of life that accompanied the revolution.
I mean, 150,000 people died in 1802 and 1803

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.440
alone. But the Haitian revolutions matter.
They matter because the Haitians, more than

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.460
any other people in the age of revolutions,
stood up for the idea that none should be

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.310
slaves, that the people who most need the
protection of a government should be afforded

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:43.620
that protection. Haiti stood up for the weak
when the rest of the world failed to.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.340
The next time you read about Haiti’s
poverty, remember that.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.900
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:54.400
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:58.910
The show is ably interned by Meredith Danko.
And our graphics team is Thought Bubble. Oh,

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:03.310
right, I write it with my high school history
teacher Raoul Meyer. Actually, he does most

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.720
of the work, who are we kidding.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.480
Last week’s phrase of the week was “fancy
footwear.” If you want to guess this week’s

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.010
phrase of the week or suggest future ones,
you can do so in comments, where you can also

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.820
ask questions that will be answered by our
team of historians.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.240
Thanks for watching Crash Course, and as we
say in my home town, Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
