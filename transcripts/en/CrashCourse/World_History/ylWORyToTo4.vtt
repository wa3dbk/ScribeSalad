00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.180
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course World History,
and today we’re going to talk about China, which

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.480
these days is discussed almost constantly on television
and in newspapers - wait, are they still a thing?

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.180
So, we used to print information on thinly
sliced trees and then you would pay someone

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.830
to take these thinly sliced trees and throw
them onto your front lawn, and that’s how

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.730
we received information. No one thought this
was weird, by the way.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:28.480
[theme music]

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.220
Right, but anyway, you hear a lot about how
China is going to overtake the U.S. and bury

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.340
us under a pile of inexpensive electronics,
but I don’t want to address those fears

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.840
today. Instead, I want to talk about how the
way you tell a story shapes the story.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.120
China was really the first modern state – by
which I mean it had a centralized government

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.550
and a corps of bureaucrats who could execute
the wishes of that government. And it lasted,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.500
in pretty much the same form, from 150 BCE until 1911
CE, which is technically known as a long-ass time.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.720
The Chinese were also among the first people
to write history. In fact, one of the Confucian

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.640
Classics is called the Shujing, or Classic
of History. This is great for us, because

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.610
we can now see the things that the Chinese
recorded as they were happening, but it is

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.690
also problematic because of the way the story
is told.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.640
So even Me From The Past with his five minutes
of World History knows that Chinese History

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.520
is conveniently divided into periods called
Dynasties.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.159
Mr. Green, I didn’t even say anything. That
doesn’t seem very fair --

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.560
Shh! What makes a dynasty a dynasty is that
it’s ruled by a king, or as the Chinese

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.860
know him, an emperor, who comes from a continuous
ruling family. As long as that family produces

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.560
emperors -- and they are always dudes --

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.140
No they aren't. First off, there were several
empress dowagers who wielded tremendous power

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.490
throughout Chinese history, and there was
one very important full-fledged empress, Empress

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.950
Wu, who WU-led China for more than 20 years
and founded her own freaking dynasty!

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.770
-and those emperors keep ruling, the dynasty
gets to be a dynasty.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.150
So the dynasty can end for two reasons: either
they run out of dudes (which never happened

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.180
thanks to the hard work of many, many concubines),
or the emperor's overthrown after a rebellion

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.479
or a war. This is more or less what happened
to all the dynasties, which makes it easy

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.579
for me to go over to camera two and describe them
in a single run-on sentence: Hi there – camera two.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.800
Leaving aside the Xia dynasty, which was sadly
fictional, the first Chinese dynasty was the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.119
Shang, who were overthrown by the Zhou, which
disintegrated into political chaos called

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.180
the Warring States period, in which states
warred over periods - oh, no, wait, it was

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.800
a period in which states warred - which ended
when the Qin emperor was able to extend his

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.830
power over most of the heretofore warring
states, but the Qin were replaced by the Han,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.599
which was the dynasty that really set the
pattern for most of China’s history and

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.450
lasted for almost 400 years after which China
fell again into political chaos – which

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.060
only means there was no dynasty that ruled
over all of China – and out of this chaos

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.810
rose the Sui, who were followed quickly by
the Tang, who in turn were replaced, after

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.900
a short period of no dynasty, by the Song,
who saw a huge growth in China’s commerce

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.110
that was still not enough to prevent them
from being conquered by the Yuan, who were

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.230
both unpopular and unusual... because they
were Mongols- [mongoltage] - which sparked

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.680
rebellions resulting in the rise of the Ming,
which was the dynasty that built the Great

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.300
Wall and made amazing vases, but didn’t
save them from falling to the Manchus, who

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.200
founded a dynasty that was called the Qing,
which was the last dynasty because in 1911

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.690
there was a rebellion like the ones in, say,
America, France or Russia, and the whole dynastic

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.260
system which at this point had lasted for
a long-ass time, came to an end.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.050
And... breathe. So that's what happened, but
what's interesting, as far as capital-H History

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.690
is concerned, is why it happened, and especially
why the people who were writing history at

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.360
the time said it happened. Which leads us
to the Mandate of Heaven.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.400
So the concept of the Mandate of Heaven dates
from the Zhou Dynasty, and current historians

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.069
think that they created it to get rid of the
Shang. Before the Zhou, China didn’t even

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.840
have a concept of “Heaven” or T’ian,
but they did have a “high god” called Shangdi.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.530
But the Zhou believed in T’ian, and they
were eager to portray the idea of heaven as

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.230
eternal, so they ascribed the concept of the
Mandate of Heaven back to a time even before

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.090
the Shang, explaining that the Shang were
able to conquer the Xia only because the Xia

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.040
kings had lost the Mandate of Heaven. This,
of course, would have been impossible, partly

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.180
because the Xia kings had no concept of “heaven”,
and partly because, as previously noted, they

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.519
didn’t exist, but let’s just leave that
aside.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.260
The Shujing is pretty specific about what
caused the Xia kings to lose the Mandate,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.849
by the way, explaining: “The attack on Xia
may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao.”

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:08.159
Sadly, the Shujing is woefully short on details
of these orgies, but orgies are the kind of

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.700
behavior that is not expected of a ruler,
and therefore Heaven saw fit to come in, remove

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.350
the Mandate and allow the Shang to take power.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.680
But then the Shang lost the Mandate. Why?
Well, the last Shang emperor was reported

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.940
to have roasted and eaten his opponents, which,
you know, bit of a deal breaker as far as

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.100
the Mandate of Heaven is concerned. Of course,
that might not actually have happened, but

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.490
it would explain why Heaven would allow the
Zhou to come to power.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.970
So basically the fact that one dynasty falls
and is replaced by another in a cycle that

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.710
lasts for 3000 years is explained, in the
eyes of early Chinese historians, by divine

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.820
intervention based on whether the ruler behaves
in a proper, upright manner. It’s after-the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.020
fact analysis that has the virtue of being
completely impossible to disprove, as well

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.150
as offering a tidy explanation for some very
messy political history. And even more importantly,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.400
it reinforces a vision of moral behavior that
is a cornerstone of Confucianism, which I

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.780
will get to momentarily.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.900
But first, let’s see an example of the Mandate
of Heaven in action. The Qin dynasty on lasted

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.810
only 38 years, but it's one of the most important
dynasties in Chinese history, so important

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.120
in fact that it gave the place its name, “Chin-
uh.” (laughing) Can I just tell you guys,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.400
that we literally just spent 20 minutes on
that shot? We shot it like 40 times. Stan,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.050
you are in love with puns.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.740
The accomplishment of the Qin was to re-unify
China under a single emperor for the first

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.210
time in 500 years, ending the warring states
period. As you can imagine, the making of

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.400
that particular omelette required the cracking
of quite a few eggs, and the great Qin emperor

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.509
Qin Shi Huangdi and his descendants developed
a reputation for brutality that was justified.

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.380
But it was also exaggerated for effect so
that the successor dynasty, the Han, would

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.150
look more legitimate in the eyes of Heaven.
So when recounting the fall of the Qin, historians

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.150
focused on how a bunch of murderous eunuchs
turned the Qin emperors into puppets, not

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.180
literal puppets, although that would have
been awesome. And these crazy eunuchs like

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.550
tricked emperors into committing suicide when
they started thinking for themselves, et cetera.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.600
So the Mandate of Heaven turned away from
these suicidal puppet emperors, which set

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:09.449
up a nice contrast with the early Han emperors,
such as Wen, who came to power in 180 BCE

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.350
and ruled benevolently, avoiding extravagance
in personal behavior and ruling largely according

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.729
to Confucian principles.

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:19.229
Under Wen, there were no more harsh punishments
for criticizing the government, executions

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:23.509
declined, and, most importantly for the Confucian
scholars who were writing the history, the

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.139
government stopped burning books. Thus, according
to the ancient Chinese version of history,

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.770
Emperor Wen, by behaving as a wise Confucian,
maintains the Mandate of Heaven. So who is

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.080
this Confucius I won’t shut up about? Let’s
go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.220
Confucius was a minor official who lived during
the Warring States period and developed a

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.470
philosophical and political system he hoped
would lead to a more stable state and society.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.870
He spent a great deal of his time trying to
convince one of the powerful kings to embrace

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.250
his system, but while none ever did, Confucius
got the last laugh because his recipe for

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.419
creating a functioning society was ultimately
adopted and became the basis for Chinese government,

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:00.620
education, and, well, most things.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.060
So Confucius was conservative. He argued that
the key to bringing about a strong and peaceful

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.310
state was to look to the past and the model
of the sage emperors. By following their example

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:17.180
of upright, moral behavior, the Chinese emperor
could bring order to China. Confucius’ idea

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.940
of morally upright behavior boils down to
a person’s knowing his or her place in a

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.919
series of hierarchical relationships and acting
accordingly.

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:28.940
Everyone lives his life (or her life, but
like most ancient philosophical traditions,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.120
women were marginalized) in relationship to
other people, and is either a superior or

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.930
an inferior. There are five key relationships
- but the most important is the one between

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.580
father and son, and one of the keys to understanding
Confucius is filial piety - a son treating

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.300
his father with reverential respect.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.440
The father is supposed to earn this respect
by caring for the son and educating him, but

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.430
this doesn’t mean that a son has the right
to disrespect a neglectful father. Ideally,

00:07:55.430 --> 00:08:00.430
though, both the father and the son will act
accordingly: the son will respect the father,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.759
and the father will act respectably.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:08.960
Ultimately, the goal of both father and son
is to be a “superior man” (Junzi in Chinese).

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.919
If all men strive to be Junzi, the society
as a whole will run smoothly. This idea applies

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:19.090
especially to the emperor, who is like the
father to the whole country. Oh, it’s time

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.949
for the Open Letter? Alright.

00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:28.690
God, that’s good. But first, let’s see
what’s in the Secret Compartment today.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:34.709
Oh, an iPhone? Stan, this doesn’t factor
into Chinese history until much later. An

00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:36.709
Open Letter to the Xia Dynasty.

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:39.529
Dear Xia Dynasty, Why you gotta be so fictional?

00:08:39.529 --> 00:08:43.569
You contain all of the most awesome emperors,
including my favorite emperor of all time,

00:08:43.569 --> 00:08:49.910
Yu the Engineer. There are so many The Greats
and The Terribles among royalty and so few

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:55.660
The Engineers. We need more kings like Yu
The Engineer: Peter The Mortgage Broker; Danica

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:02.649
The Script Supervisor; Stan The Video Editing
and Producer Guy. Those should be our kings!

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:06.699
I freakin’ love you, Yu The Engineer. And
the fact that you’re not real – it breaks

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:13.519
my heart, in a way that could only be fixed
by Yu The Engineer. The circularity actually

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.160
reminds me of the Mandate of Heaven.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.879
Best wishes, John Green

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:20.160
But back to the Junzi: So how do you know
how to behave? Well, first you have to look

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.319
to historical antecedents, particularly the
sage emperors. The study of history, as well

00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:30.339
as poetry and paintings in order to understand
and appreciate beauty, is indispensable for

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:34.839
a Junzi. The other important aspects of Junzi-ness
are contained in the Confucian ideas of ren

00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:39.259
and li. Ren and Li are both incredibly complex
concepts that are difficult to translate,

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:41.009
but we’re going to do our best.

00:09:41.009 --> 00:09:44.699
Ren is usually translated as “propriety”.
It means understanding and practicing proper

00:09:44.699 --> 00:09:48.589
behavior in every possible situation, which
of course depends on who you’re interacting

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:53.050
with, hence the importance of the five relationships.
Li is usually translated as “ritual” and

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.509
refers to rituals associated with Chinese
religion, most of which involve the veneration

00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:57.410
of ancestors.

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:00.939
Which brings us back, in a very roundabout
way, to the fundamental problem of how early

00:10:00.939 --> 00:10:05.019
Chinese historians wrote their history. Traditional
Chinese historians were all trained in the

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:10.999
Confucian classics, which emphasized the idea
that good emperors behaved like good Confucians.

00:10:10.999 --> 00:10:14.839
Would-be historians had to know these classics
by heart and they’d imbibed their lessons,

00:10:14.839 --> 00:10:19.600
chief among which was the idea that in order
to maintain the Mandate of Heaven, you had

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.569
to behave properly and not engage in orgies
or eat your enemies or eat your enemies while

00:10:25.569 --> 00:10:27.079
engaging in orgies.

00:10:27.079 --> 00:10:31.989
In this history the political fortunes of
a dynasty ultimately rest on one man and his

00:10:31.989 --> 00:10:36.569
actions - whether he behaves properly. The
Mandate of Heaven is remarkably flexible as

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:40.579
an explanation of historical causation. It
explains why, as dynasties fell, there were

00:10:40.579 --> 00:10:46.069
often terrible storms and floods and peasant
uprisings... If the emperor had been behaving

00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:47.670
properly, none of that stuff would have happened.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.839
Now, a more modern historian might point out
that the negative effects of terrible storms

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:57.529
and floods, which includes peasant uprisings,
sometimes lead to changes in leadership. But

00:10:57.529 --> 00:11:00.929
that would take the moral aspect out of history
and it would also diminish the importance

00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:02.600
of Confucian scholars.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.649
Because the scholars can tell you that one
of the best ways to learn how to be a good

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:12.110
emperor, and thereby maintain the Mandate
of Heaven, is to read the Confucian Classics,

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.160
which were written by scholars.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.489
In short, the complicated circularity of Chinese
history is mirrored by the complicated circularity

00:11:18.489 --> 00:11:22.589
of the relationship between those who write
it and those who make it. Which is something

00:11:22.589 --> 00:11:26.160
to think about no matter what history you’re
learning, even if it’s from Crash Course.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.749
Next week we’ll talk about Alexander the
Grape— really, Stan, for an entire episode?

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:34.389
That seems excessive to me. They’re just
like less sour, grapey-er lemonheads - ohhh

00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:40.360
Alexander the GREAT. That makes more sense.
Until then, thanks for watching.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.480
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.929
Our graphics team is Thought Bubble, and the
show is written by my high school history

00:11:47.929 --> 00:11:49.910
teacher Raoul Meyer and myself.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.480
Last week’s phrase of the week was "Right
Here In River City". If you wanna guess at

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.980
this week’s phrase of the week or suggest
future ones, you may do so in comments where

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.700
you can also ask questions about today’s
video that'll be answered by our team of historians.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.380
Thanks for watching. As we say in my hometown,
don't forget to be awesome!
