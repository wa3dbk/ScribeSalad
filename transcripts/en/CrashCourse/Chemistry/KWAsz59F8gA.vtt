00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
Apparently, it can turn you into a superhero
or into a mutant zombie.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.440
It's the plot device for probably half of
the sci-fi movies made in the last 60 years

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.600
and it's even the name of the song that welcomes you to the new age, to the new age, welcome to the new age.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.580
Presumably this new age occurring after some
kind of apocalypse.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.640
As principles of chemistry go, few figure more prominently in the popular imagination than radioactivity,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.760
but at the same time few are as completely
misunderstood.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.200
Most people think of radioactivity as just some thing that mutates genes and melts faces off.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.700
And yes, some forms of radioactivity can do
those things.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.660
But all the more reason to understand it,
right?

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.340
And also we can harness it to produce lots of electricity to fuel our rock and roll lifestyles without contributing to global warming,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.500
though as Fukushima has taught us it comes
with some of its own problems,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170
which we'll explore more next episode.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.520
Before we get into the nuts and bolts of nuclear
chemistry,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.180
like nuclear fission and why it's so awesome as well as fusion and why it's so hard to do,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.880
we'll first get to know radioactivity.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.590
What it is, what different kinds there are,
and why you don't really need to fear it.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.890
At least, you know, not all the time.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:17.440
[Theme Music]

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.900
So, radioactivity doesn't actually have a
lot to do with chemistry in the sense that

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.820
we've been talking about for most of this
course.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.159
Chemical reactions happen when an atom's outermost
electrons do stuff,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.780
and the protons and neutrons and even the inner electron shells are usually completely unaffected.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.840
But the protons and neutrons are still part of the atom, of course, still part of the chemicals,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.100
and their interactions are important.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.130
When protons and neutrons get directly involved
in reactions and their numbers do change,

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.170
huge amounts of energy can be released.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.729
Far more than by the transfer of electrons
that we've learnted about in other reactions.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.960
When these changes happen to the nucleus of an atom we rather logically call their study: Nuclear Chemistry.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.180
Now it's probably occurred to you already that changing the nucleus of an atom can completely change it's nature.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660
Protons are the key to an atom's identity

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.480
so any change that affects the number of protons will turn one element into a completely different one.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.000
An alchemist's dream, right? Lead to gold.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.320
So as you might expect, that's not something that usually happens in a typical chemical reaction.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.880
The same can be said of that other component
of the nucleus, neutrons.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.480
Atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons are isotopes.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.960
So changes in the number of neutrons in an atom create different isotopes of the same element.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.660
Both of these kinds of changes, changing one
element to another,

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.849
or changing one isotope to another are known
as transmutation.

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.690
And it is, indeed, possible to transmute lead
to gold.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.040
Its just so ridiculously expensive that the tiny amounts of gold produced could never pay for the process.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.560
But the very fact that it is possible, should clue you in that nuclear chemistry is an entirely different flavor of chemistry sauce.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.000
Though, as with non nuclear chemistry, the
changes that take place in a nuclear reaction

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.940
all come down to the atom's desire to have
what we all want in life, stability.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.860
Just as atoms are most stable when their outermost
electron orbitals are full of electrons,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.450
certain combinations of protons and neutrons
make the nucleus more stable.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.160
And just like when an atom gains or loses or shares electrons to stabilize it's outer shell,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.680
when the numbers of protons or neutrons aren't
ideal,

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.360
the nucleus releases some of them to try to
reach a stable configuration.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.120
When a nucleus decomposes in this way to form
a different nucleus that's radioactive decay.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.709
And just like with other chemical reactions
we've talked about,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.920
we need to know more about a nuclear reaction than just what's reacting and what's being produced.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.340
Probably the most important thing to learn is how much of the product is being made and how fast.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.600
Now you've heard of half life, it's the measurement
that tells us just that.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.170
The time it takes for exactly one half of
the sample to decay.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.220
Different nuclei have different half lives.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.560
By knowing the half life, we can calculate how much of a sample will be gone in a given amount of time.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.620
For example, the half life of phosphorus-32
is 14.3 days.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.900
So if you start with a 100 gram sample, after
about 2 weeks you'll have 50 grams left.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.300
After another 2 weeks, half of the remainder would decay leaving only 25 grams of undecayed phosphorus, and so on.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.400
Now you might be asking, if radioactive elements are always decaying in to more and more stable isotopes

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.660
that are eventually no longer radioactive,
why are they still around at all?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.139
Fascinating question, you seem to have brought
your clever pants today.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.740
Well it's fairly simple, given enough time all radioactive elements would decay in to non radioactive forms.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.320
Even ultra stable bismuth, with it's half
life longer than the age of the universe.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.180
But elements with short half lives are around because they were decayed in to by elements that recently decayed in to them.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.659
The chain of decay from the element originally
produced in whatever supernova created them,

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:44.360
to the elements that exist on Earth now last
billions and billions of years.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.020
Also, I should note that some radioactive
isotopes like carbon-14 in the atmosphere

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.460
are constantly being renewed by cosmic rays.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.780
Now radioactive decay occurs when a nucleus has a higher energy level than a potentially more stable version.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.020
Typically this difference in energy is released
as what's called ionizing radiation.

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.209
Which you know as radioactivity.

00:05:03.209 --> 00:05:09.380
It's ionizing because it has enough energy to knock electrons out or add electrons to other atoms.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.160
Essentially creating ions.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.380
There are three general types of radioactive
decay,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.479
each named for exactly what is released from
the nucleus as it decays.

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.919
Let's take a look at what may be the most
famous radioactive element, uranium.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.300
By far the most common naturally occurring
form of uranium is the isotope uranium-238.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.680
More than 99% of the natural uranium in the
world is in this form.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.620
U-238 spontaneously decays in to thorium-234, in a process that releases something called an alpha particle.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.060
This is called alpha decay and the particle that it emits is basically the same as a helium nucleus:

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.160
two protons and two neutrons.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.540
We even describe it that way when writing
it.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.550
So right away you can see that the math checks
out when it comes to the protons and neutrons.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.720
92 minus 2, is 90.
And 238 minus 4, leaves you with 234.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.279
But you'll note, that we don't write the charges.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:02.260
The helium nucleus obviously has a plus 2 charge, and the thorium atom would have a negative charge as well.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.039
While its not incorrect to write them,

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.770
these charges are often omitted to emphasize
what's going on in the nucleus.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.069
Now alpha particles have relatively low energy,
they're pretty heavy as particles go.

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:14.539
So while I try not to make a habit of walking
around with a hunk of uranium in my pocket,

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:18.249
alpha particles can be stopped by nothing
more than a sheet of paper or cloth.

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.539
The second type of radioactive decay is beta
decay, which simply emits electrons.

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.800
It has somewhat higher energy than alpha radiation,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.889
but it can still be stopped by a sheet of
aluminum foil or the top layers of your skin.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:32.649
So that thorium-234 that formed when uranium
underwent alpha decay?

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:37.249
It can continue to decay on its own, and when
it does it undergoes beta decay.

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:40.049
Releasing an electron and an atom of xenon.

00:06:40.049 --> 00:06:43.529
Notice that again, the way we write this is
a little different.

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:48.420
Even though the thorium emits an electron
we don't use the usual symbol for electrons.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.960
Instead we write it in nuclear notation form, with the mass number at top and the atomic number at the bottom.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.320
Since its an electron, and not a proton, we
put a negative 1 for the atomic number.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.220
That probably seems a little weird right now,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.419
but next week when we talk about nuclear equations,
you will see why it's useful.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:09.309
The third type of decay, is a little different,
because it only emits energy, not a particle.

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:13.789
Its called gamma decay, and it releases electromagnetic
radiation similar to visible light,

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.680
or UV radiation,
but higher on the energy scale.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:22.880
Because it's just energy, gamma radiation has no mass and contains no protons, neutrons, or electrons.

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:24.830
So it's written with two zeros.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:29.620
This form of radiation is often released when electrons transition from an unstable excited state,

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.599
to a more stable state that has a lower energy.
That's called the ground state.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:38.640
Depending on how much energy the electron loses, the extra energy can be released in the form of visible,

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.139
or ultraviolet light, x-rays,
or gamma waves.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:44.419
Let's take the example of nickle-60.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.060
Imagine there's an atom of nickle-60 with one or more of its electrons in an excited state.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.300
That's what the little asterisks designates.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.260
Atoms can get to this state when they are
themselves the products of radioactive decay,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:00.080
or if they get bombarded with radiation from other reactions pushing their electrons in to a higher energy level.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.360
Now when all those electrons drop down to
the ground state,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.719
that atom is going to release some gamma radiation.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.740
This kind of transition can also take place where other kinds of nuclear reactions are going on.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.539
So gamma decay often occurs along with some
other form of decay too.

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:16.499
So for example, if that uranium atom is at
an excited state when it decays in to thorium,

00:08:16.499 --> 00:08:21.129
it can simultaneous release gamma waves as
well as the alpha particle I already mentioned.

00:08:21.129 --> 00:08:23.649
Now you might have heard of gamma radiation
more than the other kinds I've mentioned

00:08:23.649 --> 00:08:25.899
because it can actually do some serious harm.

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:28.520
Like potentially turning you in to a giant
green rage monster

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.499
that doesn't obey the laws of conservation
of matter.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.539
Unlike the particles emitted by other kinds of radiation, gamma rays can penetrate your skin,

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.550
your cell membranes, and ultimately the organelles
within your cells.

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:42.979
So gamma radiation can not only cause skin
burns, nausea,

00:08:42.979 --> 00:08:46.060
other symptoms we associate with radiation
poisoning,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.360
it can also alter your DNA causing mutations
and cancer.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.160
OK, but to turn the frown upside down.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.750
There's one more type of radioactivity that
I'm happy to say is really simple.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:01.180
It's called spontaneous fission and it occurs when an atom simply breaks in to 2 smaller atoms without any outside help.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.519
This occurs at a ridiculously slow rate in
most cases.

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:10.240
In fact, the only substances that does it at a rate that sufficient to serve any purposes is Californium-254.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.160
And that purpose is to produce neutrons for
use in other nuclear reactions.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.060
But we'll talk more about that when we go
in to fission, fusion,

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.800
and how scientists use and control nuclear
reactions.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.410
In the meantime, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.800
If you listened carefully, you learned what
radioactivity really is.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.060
And about transmutation among elements and
among isotopes.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:33.200
And how to make calculations based on an elements
half life.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.040
You also learned about different types of
radioactive decay: alpha, beta, and gamma.

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.000
And about spontaneous fission.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.329
