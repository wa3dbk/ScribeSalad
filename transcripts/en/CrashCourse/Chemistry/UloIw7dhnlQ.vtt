00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.519
You've heard this before, but it bears repeating.
Carbon is the element of life.

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:08.499
So much so that when we explore other planets the first thing we look for is compounds that contain carbon.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.760
In fact, there was a time when we thought carbon compounds could only be produced by living things.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.060
So early chemists called them, as we still
do today organic compounds.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.920
Scientists back then considered biological
molecules to be almost mystical in origin.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.640
Until, 1828 when German chemist Friedrich Wöhler discovered that urea, a component of urine,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.280
could be synthesized simply by heating ammonium
cyanate, an inorganic compound.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.700
That proved biological molecules were just chemicals that could be created and manipulated in the lab.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.929
Suddenly a new branch of chemistry was born,
organic chemistry. It's like my favorite chemistry.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.010
So what is it about carbon though, that makes
it so special? Well, a lot of things.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.510
Like silicon, which we talked about a few weeks ago, carbon is in group 14 on the periodic table,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.460
and like all of the elements in that group,
it has 4 valence electrons.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.559
In carbon those 4 electrons can bond to other
atoms in a really promiscuous number of configurations

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.180
to form all kinds of structures.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.930
Which is why carbon is to biology, which silicon
is to geology.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.990
Just as silicon forms the basis, not only
for sand,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.920
but also most of the rocks on earth, carbon
is the foundation of most biological molecules.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.260
Really all biological molecules...right? Yup.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.859
The simplest organic molecules are pure hydrocarbons
containing only carbon and hydrogen. Hydro-carbon.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:33.689
They are where we're going to start our six
week exploration of organic chemistry.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.589
And they're a good place to start, partly because they play by the most straight forward rules.

00:01:38.589 --> 00:01:42.949
When all carbons in a pure hydrocarbon are bound to the maximum number of atoms, 4 atoms each,

00:01:42.949 --> 00:01:48.500
so that there are no double or triple bonds anywhere; these compounds are considered to be full or saturated.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.960
That means that all the carbons have 4 bonds, either with other carbon atoms or with hydrogen atoms,

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.460
in which case the hydrogens are bound to one
carbon.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.189
No questions,
no exceptions.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.880
These are the simple rules that govern some of the world's most useful, or at least, used compounds.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.880
The hydrocarbons that we use as diesel fuel,
gasoline, methane, propane.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.300
You're gonna learn what these and other compounds
look like, what they're names mean,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.200
and how they take part in the reactions that
fuel our lives.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.620
Welcome to organic chemistry!

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:24.480
[Theme Music]

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.920
The fully saturated hydrocarbons I just described are usually called by the much simpler name, alkanes.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.800
The simplest of the alkanes is one you've heard of before, methane, or CH4, the main compound in natural gas.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.380
The next simplest alkane contains 2 carbons side by side, each one of them in bonded to 3 hydrogen atoms.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.240
This is ethane, C2H6. Another gas, and it's
mostly used in the production of plastics.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.400
If we add another carbon and enough hydrogens
to fill all those spaces we get our next alkane:

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.480
propane, C3H8.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.700
Also a gas at room temperature and normal
atmospheric pressure,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.870
propane is a common fuel for cooking, heating,
and vehicles,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.980
as well as a propellant for everything from
aerosol cans to paintball guns.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.190
And we could do this all day, adding carbons
to the chain and giving each compound a name,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.260
but that would be pretty boring.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.760
Things get more interesting, though, with
the next alkane, butane, C4H10,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.170
because there are two different forms of it.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.790
The first is what you'd expect:

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.500
just a chain of carbons with hydrogens stuck wherever they're needed to make each carbon have 4 bonds.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.180
This is called normal butane or n-butane.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.700
But you can also arrange the 4 carbons differently
by making a chain of 3

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300
and then branching the fourth one off the
center of the chain.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.110
This is called isobutane or i-butane.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.320
And even though it has the same chemical formula as n-butane, its structure gives it different properties.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.780
For example, n-butane boils at -0.5 degrees Celsius while isobutane boils at -11.7 degrees Celsius.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.980
These different structures for compounds that have the same molecular formula are called isomers.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.800
As you add more and more carbon atoms to the molecule, there are more and more ways that you can arrange them.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.940
So the number of atoms is butane only allows
for 2 isomers, n-butane and isobutane.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.820
But pentane, C5H12, has 3 possible isomers
and C6H14, known as hexane, has 5.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.730
Again, I could do this all day.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.630
But looking at this table of the number of possible isomers you could see that that escalated quickly.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.220
The take away here is that molecules that have the same mass and number of atoms can form different structures.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.370
And as their structure changes, their properties
also change.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.470
As a general rule, the larger and more complex alkanes are, the more densely their molecules can pack together,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.380
which means that they tend to be liquid or
solid instead of gaseous at room temperature.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.280
So alkanes with 5 to 18 chains of carbon atoms like octane and gasoline are liquids at room temperature

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.670
and those with more than 18 carbon atoms like
paraffin or other waxes are solids.

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.230
Now you're probably picking up on a lot of words that you've heard before, even outside of chemistry class:

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:52.380
octane, propane, methane, paraffin, and so
on.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.810
You can chalk that up to the enormous popularity
of these compounds in our daily lives.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.960
Like I said, hydrocarbons are super useful because of the types of reactions they can take part in,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.740
which I will explain more in a bit.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.730
But first, I think it's high time you know
what these names actually mean.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.310
Much like the general language of chemistry
that we talked about months ago,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.760
organic nomenclature has its own system of
prefixes, suffixes, and numbers

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.570
that tell you what's in the compound being
named.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.120
Now you gotta know the prefixes because they
indicate how many carbon atoms are present.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.520
Here's one that I know you've heard before:
meth.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.340
Meth- in a name always indicates a molecule
or branch containing one carbon atom.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.060
So the difference between amphetamines doctors
prescribe

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.340
and methamphetamines that are sold on the
streets is that

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.940
methamphetamine has a methyl group, CH3 with
one carbon,

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.180
where amphetamine just has a single hydrogen
atom.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.800
Hopefully, that's helpful to you.
Don't do drugs.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.600
Eth- in a name means 2carbon atoms.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.840
Prop- means 3.
But- means 4.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.139
From there, most of the prefixes will be familiar
from geometry class

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:55.010
and you can review them in tables and learn
them.

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.850
I'm not gonna go through them all. There are
a few naming rules that are specific to alkanes.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.840
First, alkanes are always named based on the longest possible continuous chain in their structure.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.780
For example, even though this looks like a 5 carbon chain intersecting with a 6 carbon chain,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.580
it actually contains an 8 carbon chain if
you look at it close enough.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.880
So this is considered an octane with two carbon
chain attached to one of its carbon atoms.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.300
When shorter carbon chains are attached to longer ones like this, they're still named using the same prefixes,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.800
but we stuff a little -yl onto the end to
show that they're just attachments.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.010
Since this attachment has two carbons, we
call it an ethyl group.

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.920
And the attachment with just one carbon that turns amphetamine into methamphetamine, that's the methyl group.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.480
Attachments are also given a number to show
you where along the chain they're attached.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.070
The long chain is always numbered carbon by
carbon

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.400
in the direction that gives the attachments
the lowest numbers possible.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.730
So, if we number the chain the right way,
the ethyl group will end up at position 4.

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.550
But if you do it the wrong way, it's in position
5.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.340
Low numbers win so it's numbered from left
to right in this case.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.199
So when we put it all together, this compound
is called 4 ethyl octane.

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:01.980
Congratulations! You just named an organic
compound.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:05.810
Now particularly astute and studious students
would have noticed something here.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:11.250
Earlier, I introduced you to isobutane, a compound with four carbons that are not all in a chain.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.900
They call that isobutane and it is an isomer
of butane,

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:19.060
but according to these all important rules of nomenclature, it's not actually any sort of butane at all.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:24.440
The longest carbon chain is just 3 carbons long, so it's propane with one methyl group sticking off of it.

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:28.180
If we wanted to give a technical name for
it, isobutane would be 2-methylpropane.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:33.100
Though, since the second carbon is the only place where the methyl group can go without the molecule,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.140
once again becoming butane, properly proper
chemists just drop the two and call it methylpropane.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:43.880
Now suppose you have more than one of the
same size group attached to the same chain,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.060
like two methyl groups on the same alkane.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.660
In this case, you put a number for both of
them

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.650
and then prefixes like di- and tri- are used
to indicate multiple attachments.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.300
So for instance, if an octane chain has methyl
groups attached with second and fifth carbons,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.400
it's called 2,5-dimethyloctane.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.000
On the other hand, if you have attachments
of different lengths,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.440
you just name and number each one separately,
being sure to list them in alphabetical order.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.130
The structure we just used had a methyl group
on it and an ethyl group on its fifth,

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.700
it would be 5-ethyl-2-methyloctane.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.060
This is super useful for several reasons.

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:20.199
One, because there are trillions of ways that
organic compounds can come together.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:25.300
But also because you can work backwards from
a name and build a structural formula from it.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:30.840
Let's try that out.
We're gonna build 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylnonane.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:35.800
Start with the main chain, nonane. The prefix
non- indicates 9 carbons.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:43.480
Then, add an ethyl group, a 2 carbon chain on number 4 and then methyl groups, just 1 carbon on carbons 3 &amp; 5.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:48.519
Our final step is to add enough hydrogen atoms
to give every carbon atom 4 bonds.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:52.930
And now, the molecule is complete.
It's like a puzzle that we got to make.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:55.930
Of course these compounds don't exist in isolation.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:00.009
Like any other compound, they can undergo
a whole variety of reactions.

00:09:00.009 --> 00:09:04.860
But there are 3 types of alkane reactions that are important enough for us to cover right now right here.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.899
The first is the kind that made alkane the
most common fuel for combustion or burning.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.980
You'll note here that I'm saying burning, a common misperception, even among chemistry students,

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.779
is that combustion somehow equals explosion.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:20.629
While that would definitely make things more
interesting, also more dangerous,

00:09:20.629 --> 00:09:22.629
those two things are not synonymous.

00:09:22.629 --> 00:09:27.240
Combustion is the type of reaction that powers
your car and your propane grill,

00:09:27.249 --> 00:09:29.649
even candles among many other alkane fuels.

00:09:29.649 --> 00:09:35.220
The general reaction for combustion requires a hydrocarbon, oxygen, and a source of heat energy.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:39.460
In this example, we're using methane, but
it works the same for any pure hydrocarbon.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.839
The only thing that changes is the coefficients.

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:45.600
The products of a complete combustion
of a pure hydrocarbon are always

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.990
carbon dioxide and water vapor,
just those two things.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.339
The next major reaction that alkanes experience
is halogenation,

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:57.940
when halogen atoms like fluorine or chlorine are substituted for one or more hydrogen atoms in the alkane.

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:03.639
For example, the rather well-known compound
chloroform is more correctly called trichloromethane.

00:10:03.639 --> 00:10:06.579
It's a molecule of methane that is reacted
with a chlorine gas,

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:10.119
resulting in three of the hydrogen atoms being
replaced with chlorine atoms.

00:10:10.119 --> 00:10:14.290
The final reaction type is dehydrogenation,
and it, somewhat obviously,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.420
is the removal of hydrogen atoms from alkanes.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.050
For example, ethane can be dehydrogenated
by this reaction,

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:26.260
and as you can see, the result is that the carbon atoms are no longer saturated with hydrogen, thus,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:31.340
requiring the formation of double or triple bonds to give the atoms the 4 bonds that they need.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.440
Hydrocarbons that contain double or triple
bonds have

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.420
their own specific groups with different rules,
reactions, and properties than alkanes.

00:10:38.429 --> 00:10:41.079
And those are the topic of next week's episode.

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:44.160
For now though, thank you for watching this
episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.000
If you were listening, you learned about some of the different classifications of organic compounds,

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:51.480
the structure and properties of the simplest
alkanes.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.460
You also learned about isomers and why they're important, how to name an alkane based on its structure,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:59.179
and how to build an alkane structure from
its name.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:03.429
And finally, you learned a few important types
of chemical reactions that alkanes experience:

00:11:03.429 --> 00:11:06.249
combustion, halogenation, and dehyrdogenation.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:09.999
