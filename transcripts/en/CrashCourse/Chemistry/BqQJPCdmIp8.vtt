00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.480
At the risk of sounding like I'm on drugs,
aren't liquids like, super weird?

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.820
Like, the idea that there is stuff out there
that doesn't have a shape?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.559
How did they get away with not having a shape?!

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.360
And there aren't that many of them.
Like, name a liquid.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.020
My first thoughts were juice, milk and blood, and it's weird that I went from milk to blood, but not that weird!

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.930
They're both produced by the body, and both
were consumed in great quantities by the Mongols.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.100
[Mongoltage]

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.080
I've gotten off-topic; my point is that all
those things are just stuff dissolved in water.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.980
The only pure non-water liquid that the average
person in pre-modern times would run into

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.830
would be liquid fats, produced only by plants
and animals.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.310
Liquids are super weird and super rare.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.040
Only 2 of the 100-something known elements are liquid at room temperature -- bromine and mercury.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.920
Though there are a few that are nearly liquid
at room temperature.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.040
Check this out; this is a little nugget of
gallium that I got on eBay.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.220
Number 31 on the periodic table, gallium is
a non-toxic brittle metal, not very useful.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.300
When it is 10 degrees above the temperature
of this room, it will melt.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.380
Don't believe me?

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.300
Well, you probably do, but if you don't, if I wait long enough, this will actually melt in the palm of my hand,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.720
but I don't want to wait for that, so what's
warmer than the palm of my hand?

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.109
Everyone, I'm going to put this gallium in
my mouth.

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.660
It's cold right now. I really hope I don't
accidentally break the Saran wrap.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.720
It's gonna take a little while for all the heat from my mouth to get into that little nugget,

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.799
but every solid has a temperature and a pressure
at which it will melt and become a liquid.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.159
Diamonds are liquid at 3,600 degrees Celsius.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.280
And every gas, likewise, has a temperature and a pressure at which it will condense into a liquid.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.240
Titan is so cold that methane is liquid on
its surface.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.939
It falls as rain and runs through riverbeds
into methane seas.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.260
Also, I should've mentioned that I'm a trained
professional idiot.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.509
Do not do this at home.
This is an extremely weird feeling.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.500
It's starting to liquefy in my mouth, and
it's like water, but way heavier.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.540
It's like, rea--it's metal, so it's heavy.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.899
OK, I think, I feel like it's totally done
now.

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.529
So there we have it.
Liquid gallium.

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:18.510
Suddenly, the power of my body and it becomes
how liquids are really weird, right?!

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.190
Like, gallium, what the heck are you even
thinking?

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:30.490
[Theme Music]

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.340
So it's time now to actually figure out for
ourselves what's happening at a particle level

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.749
that makes liquids liquid.

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.239
First, we have to consider that no molecule
is an island.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.279
Molecules and atoms interact with each other
within substances.

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.499
It's happening because of what we call "intermolecular
forces."

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:50.579
They're weaker than the forces that cause
ionic or covalent bonds between atoms.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.400
That's why molecular substances like ice and water can be physically broken or separated into portions,

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.419
while only a chemical reaction can break apart
the molecules themselves,

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.599
like how water can be split into hydrogen
and oxygen using electricity.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.209
But, do not get me wrong, here. I'm not saying
that intermolecular forces aren't important.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.400
On the contrary, liquids and solids could
not exist without them.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.719
There are basically 2 main types of intermolecular
forces.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.980
There may be 3, depending on how you count
them.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.939
The first is called "London dispersion forces,"
which are most common in London.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.129
I'm lying to you; they're named for the physicist
Fritz London.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.109
These are the weakest of the intermolecular
forces

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.019
because they are based on the temporary clustering
of electrons that takes place inside of molecules.

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.309
They are most notable in noble gases like
helium and neon,

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.989
and non-polar molecules like carbon dioxide
or any kind of oil.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.260
And it's not that London dispersion forces
are especially strong in these substances,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.160
it's just that there's nothing else holding them together, so even these tiny forces are noticeable in them.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.799
So what makes them work?

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.719
Occasionally, in the course of their movements
around their individual nuclei,

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.189
electrons in a molecule become clustered together.

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.430
The region where they cluster briefly acquires
a slight negative charge,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.209
while other regions in the molecule experience
a slight positive charge.

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.829
Those positive and negative charges, although small, are strong enough to affect other nearby molecules.

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.389
The positive side of the molecule attracts
electrons on adjacent molecules,

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:16.409
while the negative side repels any electrons
that are close to it.

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.180
These individual attractions are extremely
weak and don't last very long

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.060
because the clustering of electrons itself
is short-lived,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.050
but the overall effect of this force is super
important.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.740
London dispersion forces are the only thing
that makes non-polar substances

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.410
like methane and even otherwise non-reactive
stuff like helium

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.100
stick together well enough to condense from
gases into liquids.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.780
And we should all remember the lesson of London
dispersion forces:

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.840
small, weak things can have important jobs,
too!

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.090
Which makes it sound like I think London is
small and weak.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.300
I don't; London is awesome.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.100
The other main type of intermolecular forces
are "dipole-dipole forces."

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.700
As you should recall from our lesson on polar and non-polar molecules, a dipole is a separation of charges,

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.830
like areas of partial positive and partial
negative in a polar molecule such as water.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.930
Dipole-dipole forces occur when the partial charges in these molecules attract or repel each other.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.700
The molecules orient themselves so that the attraction is maximized and the repulsion is minimized.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.240
It's like 2 colleagues whose very different personalities improve each other's work, like Holmes and Watson.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.530
They’re a great team, even though they get
on each other's nerves.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.860
For instance, partial charges occur in hydrogen
bromide

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.860
because the electrons are more attracted to
the bromide than they are to the hydrogen.

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.550
But the negative charges around the bromines
are attracted to

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.850
the positive charges around the hydrogens
on other hydrogen bromide molecules,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.010
and that helps to hold the molecules close
to each other.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.630
Then, there's hydrogen bonding, a special
type of dipole-dipole force,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.530
one that occurs on polar molecules that contain
hydrogen

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.470
and a strongly electronegative element such
as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.880
Because of the very small size of the hydrogen atom and the extreme attraction of its electron to those other atoms,

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.650
the dipoles in these molecules are extra strong,
so we actually it a bond.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.570
Really though, hydrogen bonds aren't chemical bonds in the same sense that ionic and covalent bonds are,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.400
but they are the strongest interactions that
occur between molecules.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.800
Water, for example, is very well-known for
its tendency to form hydrogen bonds.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.000
These intermolecular forces, while relatively
weak, are why phases of matter exist,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.020
and, in fact, it's the relative weakness of
these forces that allows a substance to change

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.030
from one phase to another fairly easily.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.490
So, the molecules of a solid are just stuck
in one spot, spinning and vibrating.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.930
Intermolecular forces are what's holding them
there.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.010
But there are always ways to break free.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.640
What phase a material is in has a lot to do with its kinetic energy, and kinetic energy can come from heat.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:35.020
So, if enough thermal energy is added to a solid, the kinetic energy of the particles increases enough

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:40.420
to allow them to overcome some of those intermolecular
forces and flow more freely.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.120
This is the liquid state.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:47.020
Like, I can smash some ice with a hammer all day if I want to to break it into smaller and smaller pieces,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.120
but only a big enough increase in heat will change its kinetic energy enough to make it change phases and become water.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.860
The particles in a liquid are still pretty
close together, though.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.140
Both liquids and solids are known as "condensed states" because there's a lot of interaction among the molecules.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:06.760
But, if the particles in a liquid acquire enough kinetic energy to escape the surface of the liquid,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:11.350
usually by absorbing thermal energy, those
freed particles comprise a gas.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.490
And the particles in a gas experience intermolecular
forces, too,

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.389
it's just that the forces are far weaker than
in the condensed states,

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:21.340
so they allow them to spread much further
apart and interact very little.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.960
Because the gas particles are so far apart,
gases have low density and are highly compressible.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.800
Conversely, the particles in a solid are very
close together,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.480
so they have high density and can be compressed only a teeny tiny bit, even under huge amounts of pressure.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.560
Obviously, liquids fall between these 2 extremes, but they're much more similar to solids than to gases.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:46.080
Most liquids are less dense and more compressible than their corresponding solids, but only slightly so.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.580
Makes sense when you think about it,

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.880
because the amount of energy it takes to move particles just far enough apart that they can flow past each other is

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.880
much less than the energy needed to separate
them completely.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.040
Now, the attraction or "cohesion" between the molecules in liquids give them some important properties.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:04.200
For one thing, because all of the particles
are pulled toward the others,

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:10.120
they tend to merge into the most compact shape possible, which, just floating in the air, is a sphere.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:14.500
But when a liquid can't form a perfect sphere
because it's not in space,

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.520
like when it's resting on a surface or filling
a container,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:22.300
its free edge will curve as much as possible
to approach that spherical state.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.800
This is easy to observe by overfilling a glass
of water.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.480
Liquid will pile up on top as long as it can,

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:33.499
until the weight of the water is greater than
the intermolecular forces holding it in place.

00:08:33.499 --> 00:08:36.139
The overall effect of this behavior
-- called "surface tension" --

00:08:36.139 --> 00:08:41.219
is so strong in water that small objects like
paper clips can actually rest on top of it.

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:43.120
Cohesion manifests itself in other ways, too.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.020
For example, in molecules with very large intermolecular forces -- like the molecules in honey,

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.080
which have tons of oxygens and hydrogens just itching to form hydrogen bonds with each other --

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.960
the cohesion is so great that it makes the
liquid flow very slowly.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:03.420
That resistance to flow is called "viscosity," and you can see it in liquids like honey, syrup, oils, glycerol.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:10.020
A third effect of cohesion can be observed by placing one end of a very narrow tube, called a "capillary tube" in a liquid.

00:09:10.029 --> 00:09:14.699
If the liquid isn't too viscous, it will spontaneously
rise into the tube.

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:17.209
This is called "capillary action," and happens
partly

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:22.889
because the molecules of liquid that are outside the tube are attracted to the ones that are inside of it,

00:09:22.889 --> 00:09:24.410
so they sort of follow them in.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.110
The capillary action also depends on another
phenomenon known as "adhesion,"

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.069
or the attraction of molecules in the liquid
to the container.

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:34.050
The liquid can't rise in the tube if it's
too attracted to itself.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:37.839
It must also be attracted to the glass, causing
it to cling to the sides.

00:09:37.839 --> 00:09:41.680
If the molecules in the liquid are more attracted
to the container than each other,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.100
they will form a concave meniscus or a crescent-shaped curve at the surface as we see here with water in glass.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.240
And if the molecules in the liquid are more
attracted to each other than to the container,

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:54.970
as is the case with mercury and glass, they'll
form a convex meniscus.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.930
So, once again, mystery is answered.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.399
The bizarre reality of liquids understood
at the most basic level.

00:10:02.399 --> 00:10:06.110
Final question for you all, an opportunity
to use your critical thinking skills:

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:13.189
Why, do you think, are liquids so much more rare than solids and gases? Discuss in the comments.

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:15.220
And thank you for watching this episode of
Crash Course.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.699
If you paid attention, you learned that intermolecular
forces,

00:10:17.699 --> 00:10:21.209
including London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole
forces,

00:10:21.209 --> 00:10:26.220
and hydrogen bonds attract molecules to each
other, especially in solids and liquids.

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:30.940
You learned about some of the effects of these forces, like cohesion, where one substance is attracted to itself,

00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:32.869
and adhesion, where it's attracted to something
else,

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:38.000
and that those effects cause some unique behaviors in liquids, like viscosity, capillary action, and surface tension.
