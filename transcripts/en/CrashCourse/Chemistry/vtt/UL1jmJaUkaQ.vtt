00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
By now, you're probably starting to see how
chemistry can change your view of the world.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.219
Chemistry explains everything you can see, how it looks, the way it feels, why it behaves the way it does,

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.549
by describing everything that you can't see.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.309
It helps us understand the biggest stuff in the universe by helping us understand the tiniest.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.670
And that's why chemistry can be kind of hard
to understand sometimes.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.130
Because we are, on a chemical scale, huge.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.830
Chemistry traffics in infinitesimal particles,
but we are made of quadrillions of those things.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.930
They are the building blocks of mass; we are
literally massive.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.390
So mass is how we massive beings tend to understand
the world.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.600
In our day-to-day dealings with substances,

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.500
we need to have some sense of how much of it there is before we can use it or predict how it's going to act.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.340
For example, chemistry will be happy to tell me that the atomic structure of the sugar in this packet is

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.700
12 carbon atoms, 22 hydrogen atoms, and 11
oxygen atoms in every molecule.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.960
But I don't have any idea how many molecules
of sugar I want to put in my tea!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.100
Or how that one molecule will react with other
chemicals in my body.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.080
To understand that kind of stuff, I need to know the mass of the sugar that I'm dealing with.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.320
In other words, I need to measure it.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.030
And that, is why there's stoichiometry,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.710
the science of measuring chemicals that go
into and come out of any given reaction.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.729
In Greek, it literally means measuring elements,

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.289
and, in essence, it allows us to count up
atoms and molecules by weighing them.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.949
Stoichiometry, yes, contains a fair bit of math, but it's one of the most important decoders that we have as chemists.

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:40.299
It's what we use to translate from the very
small to the very big,

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.340
to parley the stuff that we can't see into
the stuff that we can.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.460
And because of that, chemists use it all the
time.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.880
Including, yes, for sweetening your tea.
Ow... hot. It's... it's quite hot.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:05.580
[Theme Music]

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.060
Now if you've been with me for a couple of weeks, and I do hope you have, you're probably thinking to yourself,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.440
"Wait, wait, now, don't... don't we already
have a way of measuring elements?"

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.880
And you're right.
We do.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.640
The real coin of the realm when it comes to measuring stuff in chemistry is relative atomic mass.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.420
The average atomic mass of all of the naturally
occurring isotopes of a given element.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.210
So for example, all of the natural carbon
on earth occurs as one of 3 and only 3 isotopes:

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.730
C-12, C-13, and C-14.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.750
They all have six protons, but the number
of neutrons vary.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.300
And these isotopes show up on our planet in
totally different proportions.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.080
So the relative atomic mass of carbon is a weighted average of these three masses, which comes out to 12.01.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.569
But 12.01 what?

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.629
Well, remember when we're talking about units of measurement, we're talking about arbitrary talk.

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.489
Most, units, except for the ones that we use to measure time, aren't based on any real, objective value.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.089
We just pick a unit, like the kilogram, and we agree for a standard on what a kilogram is, and then we run with it.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.620
The same goes for atomic mass. We measure
atomic mass in atomic mass units.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.880
We made them up, and the value for a
single amu is -- bear with me now --

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.280
1/12th of the mass of an atom of carbon-12.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.240
Why?
Funny story.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.900
Until the mid-1800s, chemists in different parts of the world used different yardsticks for measuring elements.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.800
One of the most intuitive and therefore most common was to use the smallest, simplest element, hydrogen, as a base line.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.320
But in the 1850s, some chemists, led by German
Wilhelm Ostwald, proposed using oxygen instead.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.140
They preferred oxygen mainly because it combined
readily with so many other elements,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.459
so they figured it would be easier to determine
the weights of lots of compounds.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.660
So a bunch of guys stroked their beards, agonized
over this for years,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.360
until in 1903, they decided that atomic weight, as it was called, should be measured in 1/16ths of an oxygen atom.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.760
Until in 1912, isotopes were discovered and
chemists realized that you can't talk about

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.620
an element like it's all the same thing!

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.620
It turned out there was an oxygen-16, and
an oxygen-17, and an oxygen-18!

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.320
And suddenly, everyone was walking around like, "I don't know how much this such weighs anymore!"

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.019
This was so crazily disruptive that it took
another 50 years of strokey-beard meetings

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.830
for everyone to decide to use another standard
-- carbon-12.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.669
Like oxygen, carbon is common, and kind of promiscuous, when it comes to what it bonds with.

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.549
And since it has 12 protons and neutrons,

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.229
the mass of other, similar elements would
be expressed as some fraction of it.

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:32.520
So, since 1961, science has pegged one amu
as 1/12th of an atom of carbon-12.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.560
Which means that carbon has a relative atomic
mass of 12.01 amu.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.339
Oxygen, 16 amu, and hydrogen, 1.008 amu.
So that's how we way atoms.

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:46.119
But, none of this solves my tea sweetening
problem.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.660
Like, I don't know how many amus of these molecules together are going to make this taste good to me,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.819
or how many other molecules of sugar I can consume while maintaining my slim yet robust physique.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.400
This doesn't happen by itself, you know.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.969
And in order to make these calculations and
predict reactions,

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:07.360
I first need to be able to convert the atomic mass of this sugar, into a standard amount of substance.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.659
Not weight, not volume, just purely, objective
amount of stuff. You heard me, stuff.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.840
That, my friends, is what moles are for. Not
those moles, though those are nice-looking moles.

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.059
A mole is arguably the most important unit
in all of chemistry,

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:26.999
because it allows us to express a chemical's
atomic mass in terms of grams.

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:32.539
And to define what a mole is, no matter what
it's a mole of, we use our old standby, carbon-12.

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:38.089
There are 6.022 x 1023 atoms in 12 grams of
carbon-12,

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:42.549
and by definition, that number of anything
is a mole of that thing.

00:05:42.549 --> 00:05:48.529
That's a lot, and it is known as Avogadro's number, one of the most important constants in chemistry,

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:51.770
and although Avogadro isn't the one that arrived
at this number,

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.889
it's named in his honor because he used this
basic principle of comparing amounts of substances

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.509
to first weigh atoms and molecules.

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.300
So there are this many carbon atoms in a mole
of carbon-12

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.189
and there are the same number of anything
in a mole of anything else.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:11.189
Like a dozen roses is twelve roses, but a
mole of roses is 6.022 x 1023 roses,

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.659
which would be enough roses to cover the surface
of the earth quite deep.

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:20.839
A mole of sand would be 6.022 x 1023 grains of sand and if they were each one millimeter long,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:25.159
a mole of them would stretch 100 quadrillion kilometers.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.820
So you get the picture, it's a big number,
but in chemistry the thing to remember is this:

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:37.760
a mole of any element contains 6.022 x 1023
atoms of that element no matter what.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.099
This is what lets us translate number of atoms
into grams. It lets us weigh the elements.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.619
All right, follow me here.

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:49.849
One mole of carbon-12 contains 6.022 x 1023
atoms and weighs 12 grams, right?

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.369
So one mole of oxygen also contains 6.022
x 1023 atoms but because oxygen atoms are

00:06:55.369 --> 00:07:02.320
more massive it weighs 16 grams and you'll recall that oxygen's relative atomic mass is 16 amus.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.080
The number of atoms per mole remains the same,

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:08.979
but the mass of a mole depends on the average
mass of the element.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.499
This simply means that one mole of any element
equals its relative atomic mass in grams.

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:19.919
So now you've got it, 1 mole of hydrogen weighs
1.008 g, a mole of iron is 55.85 g,

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.380
and a mole of natural carbon is 12.01 grams.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.700
This is known as an element's molar mass.

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:30.499
And now that we know the molar mass of elements
we can calculate the molar mass of any compound.

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:34.719
All we have to do is add up the molar masses
of its component elements.

00:07:34.719 --> 00:07:39.759
So for instance, the formula for this sugar
or sucrose is C12H22O11.

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:44.779
One mole of sucrose, by definition contains
6.022 x 1023 molecules,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:50.660
and since each molecule contains 12 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms and 11 oxygen atoms,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:57.580
then one mole of sucrose contains 12 moles of carbon, 22 moles of hydrogen, and 11 moles of oxygen.

00:07:57.589 --> 00:08:01.489
Multiply the number of moles of each element
by its molar mass and add them all up,

00:08:01.489 --> 00:08:03.440
that's the molar mass of the whole compound.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.140
See, the mole is like our chemical Rosetta
Stone;

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.640
with it, we can translate anything from the level of atoms and molecules to the level of grams and kilograms.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.940
And we can use it to describe not only elements
and compounds, but reactions.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:20.199
And you don't need a lab full of samples to
do it, just a pencil and a calculator.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:24.620
To get back to my tea problem, let's say, y'know, hypothetically, that I'm watching my weight,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.120
so I want to know what it'll take for me to
burn a certain amount of sugar that I consume.

00:08:29.129 --> 00:08:31.479
That's a reaction!
And it's a pretty simple one.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:37.120
My body uses sucrose by combining it with oxygen to create energy plus CO2 and H20 as waste.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.779
You can write this out as an equation,

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:41.860
in which the reactants combine on the left
to yield the products on the right.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:45.819
But there's a problem here: this equation
doesn't reflect chemical reality.

00:08:45.819 --> 00:08:49.279
During a reaction, bonds are broken and new
ones are formed but the number of atoms of

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.819
each element remains the same.

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:53.930
The sugar and oxygen molecules may be busted
apart and mixed up,

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:59.260
but the number of each kind of atom that you start with ends up being exactly the same after the reaction.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.880
Conservation of mass, yo.

00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:02.629
So when writing a reaction out as an equation,

00:09:02.629 --> 00:09:06.519
the number of atoms of each element has to
be exactly the same on both sides.

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:10.060
Reconciling the reactants with the products
is called equation balancing,

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.600
and it's a good bit of what stoichiometry
is all about.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:16.290
Because from a chemical perspective an unbalanced
equation is pretty useless.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.149
It doesn't tell you how much is going in and
how much is coming out.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:21.850
Without balancing the equation it's like saying,

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:26.460
"When a mommy and a daddy love each other very much, a baby appears and that's all you need to know."

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.980
But that's not all you need to know!

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.670
So how do you do it? Not make a baby, balance
an equation. I did biology last year.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:37.709
Well the best way is to start with the most
complicated molecule, which in this case is,

00:09:37.709 --> 00:09:39.139
of course, the sucrose.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:43.779
For every molecule of sucrose that goes into the reaction, you know that you're gonna have 12 carbon atoms,

00:09:43.779 --> 00:09:49.259
so right off the bat you know that you're gonna have to end up with at least 12 molecules of CO2 as a product,

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:52.320
because that's the only molecule where those
carbon atoms end up.

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:53.930
Now let's deal with the hydrogen,

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.379
because that also shows up in only one molecule
on both sides of the equation so that's easier.

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:01.660
You know that at least 22 atoms of hydrogen
go into the reaction

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.160
and the product contains some multiple of 2 hydrogen atoms (that's the H2 in the water molecule).

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.750
So if there were 11 water molecules produced,

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.930
that would balance the hydrogen with 22 hydrogen
atoms on each side.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.610
Finally, the oxygen.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.480
Since we know we have 12 CO2 molecules and
11 water molecules as products so far,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.430
we also know that we're gonna end up with
thirty-five oxygen atoms.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.889
If you look at your reactants, on the left,
you see that you have 11 oxygen atoms in the

00:10:25.889 --> 00:10:29.569
sucrose molecule and 2 in the molecular oxygen,
O2.

00:10:29.569 --> 00:10:34.420
The carbon and hydrogen are balancing nicely with only one molecule of sucrose, so let's leave that alone.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.829
But there could be any number of paired oxygen
atoms involved.

00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:40.269
Since you need 35 and you know you have 11
to start with in the sucrose,

00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:45.120
you just need 24 more, which would equal 12
molecules of O2.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.910
And now, the equation is balanced! You know
exactly what my body is producing.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:55.250
For every molecule of sucrose I'm metabolizing I have to inhale 12 molecules of oxygen and in return,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.350
in addition to a little sugar buzz, I'll produce 12 molecules of carbon dioxide and 11 molecules of water.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:07.200
This is incredibly useful in helping us to understand the proportions of chemicals as they react at the molecular level.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.639
But in a lab, or in life, you have to work
with measurable amounts of stuff,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:15.900
so the last stoichiometric trick you need
up your sleeve is to calculate specific masses

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.520
of the reactants and products.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.300
So for instance, how much oxygen will I need
to inhale in order to burn 5 grams of sugar?

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.190
To figure that out, we just need to focus
on the left part of the equation,

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.279
because we only need to quantify the reactants.

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:30.029
First, convert your balanced equation into
molar masses;

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:33.879
in order to get from molecules to grams, you
need to go through moles first.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.379
When you figure out the molar masses, you see that the ratio of sucrose to oxygen is actually pretty close:

00:11:38.379 --> 00:11:42.519
384 grams of oxygen for every 342.3 grams
of sucrose.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:46.490
Then you simply compare this ratio to the
masses of reactants in your experiment,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:52.199
5 grams of sugar to X grams of oxygen, and
hopefully you know how to solve for X.

00:11:52.199 --> 00:11:57.089
For every 5 grams of sugar I ingest I'll need
to inhale 5.6 grams of oxygen,

00:11:57.089 --> 00:12:00.160
which I happen to know is about 35 breaths'
worth.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.279
So as long as I manage to stay alive for the
next minute and a half or so,

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:07.539
I'll manage to burn off this five grams of
sugar. Down the hatch!

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:12.540
Today, we learned about two of the most important units of measure in chemistry, atomic mass units and moles.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.780
We also learned how to calculate molar mass and how to balance a chemical equation and finally,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:22.040
we talked about how to use molar ratios to calculate the amount of stuff that goes in and out of a reaction.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.589
