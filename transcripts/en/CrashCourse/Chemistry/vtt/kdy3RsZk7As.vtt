00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
If they know it at all, most people know silicon from the valley in California that bares its name.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.240
The birthplace of modern computing where technological
dreams became reality.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.769
Where brilliant twenty-somethings became millionaires.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.880
But we chemists know silicon first and foremost
as the most abundant element in the earth's crust.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.900
Oxides of silicon, known as silicates, make
up sand,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.510
which covers not only every desert and shoreline
on the earth, but also most of the ocean floor.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.040
Silicates also include quartz and most types
of clay and they're found in living things,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.100
like little spikes and nettles.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.180
And as a polishing agent in toothpaste.
It's everywhere!

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.570
And, of course, because of their uniquely
wonderful chemical properties,

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.370
crystals of elemental silicon form the basis
of semiconductors.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.960
These crystals can be combined to make diodes
and transistors acting essentially as

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.250
chemical on/off switches that make binary
code, and, therefore, computers possible.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.880
Fascinatingly enough, only a few minor differences
in atomic arrangement allow an element

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.220
found on the bottom of the ocean to make the
computer that you're watching me on possible.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.780
As with carbon, everything comes down to the
network these atoms form.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.500
Once you learned the chemistry of these networks, you'll come to understand why glass is glass and clay is clay.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.380
You'll understand what chemists mean when
they talk about "doping."

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.900
And you'll finally get why a valley in California is named for arguably one of the most intriguing element in the universe.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:25.780
[Theme Music]

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.340
This sand, and this glass, and this quartz
are basically the same thing,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.880
just with the atoms arranged a little differently.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.100
The chemical name of this substance is silica
made up of silicon and oxygen in a 1:2 ratio.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.160
For that reason we say that the chemical formula
of silica is SiO2.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.640
Even though it doesn't actually exist as separate
individual molecules.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.200
Like graphite and diamond, the two forms of pure carbon, silicons and it's oxides are network solids.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.240
And also like graphite and diamond, the different forms that they take are all about bonding differences.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.220
The form of the silica that makes sand, is exactly the same as the form that comprises quartz.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.140
In fact the silica in sand is basically just
tiny bits of quartz.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.780
Silica structure is based on a tetrahedral arrangement of a silica atom bonded to oxygen atoms.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.700
That's right -- 4, not 2.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.030
The trick is that each of the oxygen can form
two bonds,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.490
so they also bond to another silicon atom
on the other side.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.870
So each silicate is bonded to 4 oxygens, while
each oxygen is bonded to 2 silicons.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.920
Si2O4 simplifies to SiO2, and that's where
we get the formula.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.980
As the molecule continues to build on itself,
it can make various crystal structures

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.860
depending on the orientation of the little
tetrahedrons.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.420
These are different forms of quartz, clays,
and other minerals.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.080
They can make two dimensional forms as sheets,
or three dimensional crystals.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.840
And each form has its own properties and behaviors.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.060
Ceramics, and other clays, get their strength
from the two dimensional types.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.879
When the clay is wet, silica sheets move around
freely in the clay

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.510
and as it dries they move closer to each other
and bond to together forming a rigid framework.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.690
This resulting composite is extremely hard
and heat resistant.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.209
Both of these properties make ceramics useful
in tons of ways

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.989
that you've probably been exploring since you were a toddler and got your first box of modeling clay.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.819
Three dimensional silicates can take lots
of shapes, too.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.030
Although not all of them are true crystals.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.319
Glass is an enormously important example of a three dimensional silica based amorphous solid.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.430
It's worth mentioning here, even though its
not a crystal

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.300
because it's molecular structure is extremely similar to the structure of quartz, just not as orderly.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.349
The arrangement of silicon and oxygen in quartz
is very regular and rigid.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.360
The molecular structure of glass,
on the other hand,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.400
looks like Mother Nature tried to build a quartz crystal while she was a little bit drunk.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.020
The atoms are attached in random numbers and shapes, creating a gradual structure with no definite order.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.110
This is why glass can be formed into almost
infinite shapes when it's heated,

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.580
while quartz keeps it's characteristic crystal
shape.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.379
Because it's an amorphous solid with bonds of varying strength, glass doesn't have an exact melting point.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.320
Instead, it softens as its heated and becomes honey-like, except extraordinarily hot and not sweet at all.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.780
Quartz doesn't do that.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.340
It's melting point is much higher but it melts at an exact temperature and has no pliable in-betweeny state.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.080
Like all silica crystals, quartz, glass and
ceramics are electrical insulators,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.360
because they have no free electrons to transfer
charges over a distance.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:12.100
The atoms have 4 valence electrons and they form 4 bonds so all the electrons are perfectly well used.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.079
For this reason, these materials are used
widely as insulators in electrical applications.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.369
Ceramics, for example, are used to hold live
wires and power lines and to make capacitors,

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:24.539
which are basically layers of electrical conductors
separated by layers of insulators.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.500
But all of these silica based network solids I talked about so far contain both silicon and oxygen atoms.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.940
Crystals made up of silicon are insulators
too, in their peer state,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.760
but they can be made to transfer electricity
by a process called doping.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.409
And no, we're not gonna make a Lance Armstrong
joke.

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.680
We might make an analogy though --

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.360
it's like, much like a perfectly fit athlete injecting himself with all kinds of weird foreign stuff.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.879
Silicon doping involves incorporating impurities
into a crystal that mess up its electron balance.

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.749
It can do that in one of two ways.

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.300
If the impurity is an element with more electrons
than silicon has, like Phosphorus or Arsenic,

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.540
the resulting crystal will contain excess
electrons.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.560
But, if the impurity is an element with fewer
electrons, like Aluminum or Boron,

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.189
it leaves holes where electrons are missing
from the normal structure.

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.320
Doped silicon crystals are known as solid-state
semiconductors.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.819
Those doped with elements that add electrons
are called N-type,

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.969
or negative semiconductors, because of the
resulting charge from the additional electrons.

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.879
With N-type semiconductors, the charges carried
by the excess electrons

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.060
and because there's no room for them to integrate into the structure, they move freely about the crystals.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.460
Similarly, crystals dope with elements that
create an electron deficiency are called P-type,

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.580
or positive semiconductors, because they have a more positive charge than pure silicon would have on its own.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.300
P-type semiconductors work a little differently.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.580
Because they have empty spaces available here
and there,

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.140
the electrons that are normally part of specific silicon atoms are able to jump around from one atom to another.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.460
Each jump fills a hole and creates a new one, allowing another electron to move in the same way.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.460
So if both N-type and P-type crystals are both electrical conductors, why do we call them semiconductors?

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.979
Well, thank you for asking.

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.909
The reason semiconductors are so valuable
is that they have the amazing ability to conduct

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.449
electricity freely under some conditions,

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.569
but completely refuse to conduct it under
other conditions.

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:10.719
So yes, they are partial, or semi conductors.

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:15.119
So these properties become most useful when
a P-type and N-type semiconductor are placed

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:17.249
next to each other to form a diode.

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:18.669
Because their charges are opposite,

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.259
the free electrons in the N-type are attracted
to the P-type and tend to migrate to its holes.

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.189
And when an electrical field is applied to
this arrangement,

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:28.419
so that the N-type is attached to the positive
terminal, also called the anode,

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.259
and the P-type is attached to the negative
terminal, or the cathode,

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.110
all of the free electrons are pulled completely
into the N-type.

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.939
These free electrons are attracted away from
the holes, not into them,

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.039
so any further motion is blocked and no more
current passes through the diode.

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.399
This type of arrangement is called reverse
bias.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.380
However, just by reversing the polarity of the electron flow, if you will, we can create a very different situation.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.960
If the N-type side is attached to the negative terminal, and the P-type side attached to the positive terminal,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.920
then the electrons are pulled in to the P-type
making this part an electrical conductor again.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.160
This process called forward bias is self perpetuating, it allows the current to readily flow through the diode.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.140
The fact that this conduction only works in
one direction is extremely useful!

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:14.889
You know AC and DC right?
Back in Black for those about to rock?

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:20.289
AC is alternating current, where the flow of electrons alternates in one direction to the other.

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.860
In DC, or direct current, is exactly what
it sounds like, the electrons go directly

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.899
where they're headed without backtracking.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.540
And simple arrangements of diodes can be used to convert AC to DC like in this power supply for my laptop.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.619
P and N-type semiconductors can also be combined
in sets of three.

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:39.379
These are called transistors and they've completely
revolutionized the field of electronics,

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:42.419
also the entire world since they were invented
in 1947.

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.219
One of the main functions of a transistor
is to switch an electrical signal on and off.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.699
Basically when it allows a current to flow in the forward bias direction, the switch is turned on.

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.449
When the current drops below the minimum the
switch is turned off.

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:56.360
This switching is the basis of binary code.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.199
Ones and zeroes representing the on and off
states of the transistor.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:04.949
And that code is how we store and process
information using computer chips,

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.879
which are just collections of transistors
working together.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:15.540
Such a tiny simple device made mostly from one single element, and yet revolutionizing our entire world.

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.560
That my friends is how Silicon Valley got
its name

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:22.020
and how network solids of silicon made this
conversation we are having today possible.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.040
Thanks for taking advantage of all your tiny transistors today by watching this episode of Crash Course Chemistry.

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:29.770
If you paid attention you learned that sand,
and glass, and ceramics, and computer chips,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:37.260
and must more are all really just different types of network solids that can be formed by silicon and its oxides.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.800
You learned the differences in their arrangements
and bonding of atoms,

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.600
and you learned how those differences result
in wildly varying properties among the solids.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.800
You also learned what a solid-state semiconductor
is, both P-type and N-type,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.840
and you learned how they can be combined to
create diodes and transistors.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.740
Finally you learned how transistors are combined
to make computer chips,

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.329
and how their switching mechanism tells computers
what to do.

00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:01.990
I don't know about you, but it blows my mind!

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.250
