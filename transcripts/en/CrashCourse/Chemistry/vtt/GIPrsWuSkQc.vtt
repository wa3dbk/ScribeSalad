00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.459
One of the things that teachers who aren't
me tend to say is that,

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:06.270
you need to learn all this stuff because someday
you'll be out there in the "real world"

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.230
and you'll need to know how to do all the
things that adults do.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.260
First of all, I don't really believe this because I think you should be learning just 'cause learning is fun.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.529
But I also remember when I was kid hearing
that

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.259
and thinking that this real world couldn't be that much tougher than high school, because it was pretty tough.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.800
But looking back, I can tell you that life indeed does get a bit more complicated after 12th grade,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.310
with jobs, and bills, and raising kids, and
taxes,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.590
and I haven't done any of the raising kids
but I've seen it and it looks really hard.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.490
And then there's always knowing that there's
always more work waiting to be done.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.560
But the truth is while it's more complicated,
it's not really that much harder than high school.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.540
Most adults rarely have to take pop quizzes, or final exams, or ask permission to go to the bathroom,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.460
wear orthodontics, have a curfew, live on
an allowance, find a date for prom,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.740
or shower in a room full of people that they don't like, all while trying to build your first real lasting relationships.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.640
Yes, "real life" is tough but the ideal world
of teenagers: not ideal.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.700
Turns out that the biggest problem isn't so
much that the pressure increases in "real life",

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.420
you just have to learn a few new tricks to
deal with it.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.520
And the same goes for gases.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:21.280
[Theme Music]

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.619
Last week we discussed how you can identify certain qualities of gas by using the Ideal Gas Law. PV = nRT.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.880
It states that the product of the pressure and the volume of a gas is equal to the number of moles of the gas,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.880
which we call n times universal gas constant
called R times the temperature of the gas.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.780
R is always the same and if we know three of the other four things we can calculate the fourth one.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.020
But the problem with that equation is that true to its name, it only works under hypothetical ideal circumstances.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.539
In chemistry, as in all things, there's the
best of all possible worlds,

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.749
which is usually easier and more fun to think
about and then there's real life.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.249
To understand and describe how gases behave
in real life, we need a few new tricks.

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:08.240
And it was dutch scientist Johannes Diderik van der Waals who figured out those tricks for us.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.000
Van der Waals was born in 1837 in the Netherlands,
the first of 10 children.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.800
His father was a carpenter and working class kids weren't allowed to go to the fancy school that led to university.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.420
Instead, he had to settle for advanced primary
education, which ended when he was 15.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.620
He didn't let that define him though, and
instead of becoming a carpenter,

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.299
as most people would have in his position,
he became a teacher's apprentice.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.510
He worked hard and in time, went from apprentice
to teacher,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.790
and eventually became the director of the
whole school.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.920
During those years, van der Waals continued
educating himself, as well as his pupils,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.020
and he took advantage of every class he could
possibly take.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.780
Over the course of many years he ended up taking more than enough courses in math and physics to earn a degree,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.950
but as he hadn't gone through the proper channels
as a student, he wasn't allowed to have one.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.490
So, why would he bother to study so hard with no obvious reward?

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.579
Well, first of all, he just really loved physics.

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.239
But, more importantly, he was trying to answer
a question.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.560
See, at that time, scientists only knew how to analyze the behavior of gases with the ideal gas law,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.939
just like you, at this point.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.549
Most of those calculations produced very little
error,

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.290
but some scientists had noticed that when
a gas was in a situation that crowds its particles,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.049
high pressure, low temperature, just high density, it starts to deviate from what the ideal gas law predicts.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.890
They couldn't figure out why sometimes they
got the wrong answer.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.570
And van der Waals was determined to figure
it out.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.790
Finally at the age of 36, after trying for
roughly two decades,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.819
van der Waals was awarded a doctorate in theoretical
physics.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.900
And even more exciting, by that time he had figured out the solution to the puzzle of real gas behavior.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.680
In his doctoral thesis, he introduced his new gas law, which we now call the 'van der Waals Equation,'

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.400
and explained why gases don't behave quite
the way everyone thought they should.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.239
And in 1910 when he was 73 years old, he was
awarded a Nobel Prize for his work,

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.909
and I'm glad they hurried it along because
you can't get a Nobel Prize after you die.

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.379
So, what exactly is the problem with this
ideal gas law?

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.959
Well, if the two sides of the ideal gas law
were equal all the time and for all gases,

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.340
as we would expect for something called a
law,

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.080
then PV divided by nRT should equal 1, as any fraction in which the numerator and denominator are equal.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.300
This relationship can be shown graphically,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.690
but when you work with real gases in a real
lab

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.850
it becomes apparent that the relationship
isn't constant at all, much less equal to one.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.070
Instead, it changes with increasing pressure, and the amount that it changes is different for different gases.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.940
So much for the whole constant thing.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.880
OK, let's just start over with the ideal
gas law, and we'll work from there.

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.529
We create a closed system by sealing gas in
a container so the amount of gas is constant.

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.700
R is always constant, and for the purpose
of this discussion,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.770
we'll assume that we're holding the temperature
constant.

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.180
So nothing here can change except for P and
V.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.150
If the ideal gas law worked in all situations,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.930
any increase in pressure would cause the volume
to decrease at an equal rate,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.000
thus keeping the product of the two constant.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.820
But as we saw on our graph, that's not really
what happens.

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.840
So...what does happen? Well let's ask our
buddy, Johannes van der Waals.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.410
Van der Waal's solution depends on the existence
and interaction of molecules.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.310
Now, we take that for granted today,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.080
but remember the existence of even atoms was
disputed until Einstein proved it in 1905.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.920
Few scientists in 1873 were prepared to accept
the theory that required atoms not only to exist,

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.360
but also to form molecules that interacted
in complicated ways.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.360
So the problems with the ideal gas law do
depend on interactions between molecules,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.270
specifically, two simple facts:

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.490
First, real gases aren't some sort of massless,
mystical vapors.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.419
They're made of real, physical particles that
take up real, physical space.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.289
And the space that they take up deducts from
the amount of space that's actually available

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.830
inside the container they're in.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.940
So when we talk about the volume in the ideal gas law, we need V not to be the volume of the container,

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.960
but the volume of the container minus the space that the particles themselves are taking up.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.840
So we have to create a correction for volume,
and that correction is going to include n,

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.729
because it's proportional to the number of
molecules in the container,

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.269
but also b, an experimentally determined constant
that's different for every type of gas.

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:09.440
Obviously gases with large atoms or molecules would need more correction than those with small particles,

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.340
and with that V is reduced to a more accurate
value.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.200
Second, even though some people didn't want to accept it, particles in real gases are attracted to each other.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.260
Even more so when they're close together.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.669
When they're crowded, they tend to stick closer
together,

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.849
and therefore hit the sides of the container
less often, decreasing the internal pressure.

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.840
So, when we're figuring out the number for
P,

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.389
we have to account for the decrease in pressure
that's caused by those intermolecular attractions.

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:36.460
To correct the pressure, we start out with
n and V

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.629
because the amount of attraction depends on
both of those factors.

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:44.729
In addition, they're both squared, for complicated
reasons, having to do with how particles interact.

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:46.919
Just trust me -- and van der Waals.

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:50.259
You should trust him because he's much more
trustworthy than I am.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:55.580
The we include another experimentally determined constant that is again different for every gas.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:59.680
Some types of atoms and molecules are more
attracted to each other than other kinds are,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.560
and the degree of attraction determines the
value of a.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.960
So, we add all of that to P and the formula
ends up looking like this.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.520
That's the corrected pressure times the corrected
volume equals nRT.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.800
And yeah, that is a long way to go to get
to a corrected equation!

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.880
I don't know about you, but I'm not gonna do all that work and then not use it, so let's try it out.

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:23.349
Suppose we had a balloon with a volume of
ten liters.

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:27.379
And, I know that that sounds like a lot, but
it's only about this much - big balloon.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.599
How much pressure do you think the gas is
exerting on the insides of the wall of the balloon?

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:33.520
Well, let's try calculating it both ways.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.750
We will try it first with the ideal gas law.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:43.060
Our volume is 10.0 Liters, let's say I've put
exactly 0.500 mole of nitrogen gas in this,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:51.819
R is always the same, and the temperature here is, let's just say, 21.50, which converts to 294.65 Kelvin.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:58.060
If we do the calculation, round appropriately, we find that the answer is 122 kilopascals, OK?

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.289
But what does the van der Waals Equation tell
us?

00:08:00.289 --> 00:08:03.620
We have to plug in all the same numbers, plus
the two correction factors.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:09.759
The pressure correction factor a for nitrogen gas is 139 kilopascals per liter square, mole square,

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:14.110
and the volume correction factor b is 0.039
liters per mole.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.080
Do the math, round correctly, and you have
122 kilopascals.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.020
Well, that is disappointing.
No difference at all.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.320
Stupid van der Waals!

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.439
No, wait a minute!
We talked about this.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:32.260
The Van der Waals equation is most important and most relevant at low temperatures and high pressures.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.580
So, how can we increase the pressure inside this balloon?

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.539
How can we get the gas particles closer together?

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.300
We know that pressure is caused by the gas molecules bumping against the inside of the container.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.540
We can make them bump around more often by
increasing the temperature,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.770
or by crowding the same molecules into a smaller
container.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.160
It's hard to keep track of the temperature
inside this balloon,

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:55.700
so let's try increasing the pressure by using
a smaller balloon.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.490
Or, into a ping-pong ball!

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:03.630
Now, this contains about 1.00 Liters of gas,
and obviously I probably can't squeeze this

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:09.450
much gas into a container this size cause
the ping-pong ball would explode...

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:11.450
Probably.
I'm not trying.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:17.410
But we could certainly calculate how much pressure there would be if we did squeeze all of this gas into this container.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.720
Starting with the ideal gas law, plug in all
the same numbers as before,

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.420
except change the volume to 0.100 liters.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.200
Do the calculation and you'll find that it
gives us 12,200 kilopascals of pressure.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.040
Okay, that's not too surprising.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.800
We have the same amount of gas in a container
that's one hundredth the size of the first one.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.320
So it makes sense that it would exert 100
times as much pressure.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.779
Now we've got to try it out with the van der
Waals equation.

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:45.540
If we plug all the appropriate values and correction factors into the van der Waals equation and do the calculation,

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:52.530
we find that the gas in the small container
actually exerts a pressure of 11,800 kilopascals.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.140
So it really does matter!

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.020
That's a difference of 3,000 kilopascals from
what we would expect using the ideal gas law alone!

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:02.639
And that kind of mistake isn't not a huge
problem when you're just blowing up balloons,

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:06.000
but it definitely would be a problem if you
were taking measurements in a lab,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.709
or planning a mission to the bottom of the
Marianas Trench.

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:12.640
Pretty impressive stuff for a guy who wasn't allowed a normal education because society was like,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.200
"Oh, your dad's a carpenter..."

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:18.250
I'm totally impressed by all that van der
Waals has taught us about real gases,

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.970
but I think it's also important to remember
the lesson we can learn from his life.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:24.550
Don't give up on your dreams.
Seriously.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:26.060
You never know where they're going to take
you.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.750
Thank you for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.060
If you were paying attention,

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:34.100
you learned that the constants in the gas law aren't really all that constant when stuff gets real,

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:39.060
that the ideal gas law has to be corrected for volume because atoms and molecules take up space

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:41.990
and for pressure because they're attracted
to each other.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.180
And that Einstein was behind a lot more of
what we know today than most people realize.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:50.550
You also learned that the correction factors
of the van der Waals equation really do matter,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:54.839
but only under specific conditions and that
you should never give up just because things

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:57.269
are hard or people think your ideas are crazy.

00:10:57.269 --> 00:11:00.269
Because, in the end, they may just turn out
to be right.

00:11:00.269 --> 00:11:02.829
This episode of Crash Course Chemistry was
written by Edi Gonzalez.

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.480
The script was edited by Blake de Pastino
and myself.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.920
And our chemistry consultant was Dr. Heiko
Langner.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.709
It was filmed, edited, and directed by Nicholas
Jenkins.

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:13.560
Our script supervisor and sound designer is
Michael Aranda.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.360
And our graphics team is Thought Cafe.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.200
That didn't go as far as I thought it was
going to.
