00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is crash course mythology and today, we're gonna finish up our heroes series by telling the story of a great hero.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.560
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.420
Okay, not really. The Rock may be the sexiest man alive, but he's no demigod like Ma'ui,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.000
The demigod hero of Oceania, and the role he recently voiced in the film, Moana.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.500
The legendary Ma'ui is pretty different from his cartoon counterpart.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.880
He's younger, more lithe, and a little smarter. Still, he's an adventurer, he has a divine birth, he's a trickster, and a culture hero.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.020
He's everything we love here at Crash Course.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.500
*Crash Course Intro Music*

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.520
Ma'ui myths are found throughout Oceania, particularly in Hawaii. Like Heracles, the most well-known Ma'ui stories focus on a series of heroic deeds.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.380
But where Heracles spent the vast majority of his labours killing, or stealing monstrous animals,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.220
Ma'ui's great deeds are a little more motley. He fights a monstrous eel, but he also gets into an argument with the sun!

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.180
He creates the entire island of New Zealand.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.580
Some stories characterize Ma'ui as a hero, and some of them work aetiologically to explain aspects of the natural world.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:30.680
And others capture the mythic origins of Pacific Islander culture, and also unlike Heracles, these tasks are not assigned to Ma'ui as one big hero project.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.280
They occur throughout his life and act as episodic glimpses into Oceania's culture.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.380
But, okay. Enough treading water. Without further ado, Ma'ui's seven great deeds.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.600
One: Fighting his mom's house. Not fighting in his mom's house,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.720
fighting the house. Back in the mythic times of Oceania lived a goddess named Hina of the fire.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.170
She had four sons and all of them were named Maui. One day she gives birth to a fifth named, you guessed it

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.449
Maui. This Maui, they call him Maui the skillful, is our hero.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.820
But to Hina of the fire he's one too many mouths to feed. So she sets Maui five

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:14.900
adrift at sea.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.820
It just, you know, it wouldn't be a myth without just a little attempted infanticide.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.320
You know? Luckily for Maui five ,the god of the sea takes favor on him

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.989
and he survives the waves and currents of the ocean. He makes it all the way back to Hina of the fire's house.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.600
She can't believe it and doubling down on her motherly abandonment,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.379
she says that she'll only take him back if he proves his worth.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.339
He must destroy her house by throwing

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.630
spears through its thatched roof. If you remember the Muendo(?) epic, this kind of radical remodeling should sound familiar.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.979
Maui squares off against the house, beginning the fearsome battle where our hero defeats two

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.180
terrible

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.230
doorposts. He strikes down short post and tall post,

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:05.400
his mother, for whatever reason, is finally proud of her son and welcomes him, um,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.280
home? Welcomes him to a pile of thatching? Either way heroic deed done. Two:

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.359
Raising the sky. Maui eventually gets a home, but things aren't all hunky-dory. In those days the sky that stretched over

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.960
Oceania was very very low. We're talking

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.320
scraping the tops of trees low. Clouds blocking all the light low. Maui decides to do something about this.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:35.829
He gets a swig of some mystery drink out of a strange lady's gourd which fills him with enough magical strength to lift up

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:41.980
the whole sky. Though, palm tree leaves are still flat to this day from the time when the sky

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.640
pressed down on them. With all the new room Maui fashions a kite. He calls for help from a nearby wizard and a few

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.660
incantations later,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.130
there's a great magical wind. In fact the winds are so strong that they snap Maui's line and blow his kite away.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.490
But during the struggle Maui learns to read the winds and

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.839
understand the weather. Which he passes on to the people of the islands and now they can travel further than ever before. Three:

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.490
Fishing for New Zealand. Maui

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.960
might have sorted out the sky

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.399
but he was still the youngest brother. His older brothers all thought Maui the skillful was actually Maui the lazy and Maui the

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.960
bad at fishing. They teased him and tattled on him to Hina of the fire. Maui decides he is gonna prove his brothers wrong!

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.770
He travels to the underworld to make contact with a long-dead

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.399
ancestor. This ancestor is half dead and half alive,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.179
so they give Maui the jawbone out of their dead half,

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.089
which he carves into a magical fish hook.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.359
Then he goes and catches one of his mother's sacred Alae birds to use as bait. Now,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.609
he's ready to go fishing. Maui five and his brothers row out farther than anyone has ever gone,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.720
and they begin to fish. His brothers begin complaining about his laziness,

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.690
but then,

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.809
something catches on Maui's hook. The brothers gather around and helped Maui pull and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.049
pull and rather than pull up a fish they pull up an

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.619
entire island. And after this his brothers stopped calling Maui lazy. Also. We get Lorde!

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.810
I mean we may never be Royals, but perhaps

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.460
heroes? Four:

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.960
Slow the Sun now he's third task was good for his reputation

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:27.039
But his fourth task is important for everyone on the Pacific Islands they all enjoyed the new room under the sky

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:34.059
But there's one problem the Sun streaks across it so fast that no one has any time to do any work

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.770
No one can tan hides

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.740
and there's not enough light to create tapa cloth a

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.030
handmade patterned textile

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:47.800
Constructed from trees and trust me tapa cloth is a big deal Heena of the fire comes to her son and asks him

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.639
Will you do this deed will you slow down the Sun?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.280
She thinks there is no way he's gonna pull it off. But now he has learned a thing or two about

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.430
Asking for help he goes to his grandmother, and she tells him the Sun is so fast because it has

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.440
16 legs

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.090
If you have any hope of catching it you must set that many traps one snare for each leg

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.790
she gives Maui a magical stone ax

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.219
Once you've smeared the Sun use this to get your way now

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.720
He sets the snares and snags the Sun. He approaches it brandishing the magic

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.720
Axe he threatens it saying he will strike it down

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.119
Unless it agrees to take a dang time and give the people a chance to go about their day the Sun agrees

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.020
The day lengthens and people are much happier now

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.090
He then gets to go back to his doubtful mom and decree

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.410
What can I say except you're welcome my five?

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:51.309
Winning fire for Humanity many cultures have stories about discovering fire or stealing it from Supernatural sources think

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.349
Prometheus or grandmother spider or Loki who is the worst, but occasionally useful to have around?

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.030
So this is all to say Maui's fifth task might sound familiar now

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:07.599
We dealt with the too cramped sky, and the too fast Sun but the people of Oceania still don't have fire now

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.719
He knows his mother Hina of the fire possesses its secret

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.290
But she's not talking so Maui decides to go over her head and journeys once again to the underworld there

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:24.340
He tracks down his great-great grandmother ma Hui. Ah and convinces her to give him the secret of fire ma

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.569
Hua reaches down and pull one of her fingernails in which burns a tiny fire

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.610
She tells him take this back to the surface and you can spread the fire to all

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:39.949
Humanity Maui is very grateful and begins to head back, but on the way

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.760
drops the nail into a stream ah

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.320
Let's head to the thought-bubble to see how Maui gets himself out of this heroic pickle now. He goes back and tells ma

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:58.010
Hooyah who shakes her head and gives him another fingernail. He turns around heads back and drops it into a stream again

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.480
ah so back

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:06.170
He goes and he asks again and the same thing happens it happens again with all of the rest of her fingernails and men her

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:12.380
Toenails man what a klutz when Maui comes for her last toenail ma Hui odd gets so angry

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:17.089
That she throws it on the ground and sets the underworld on fire now

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:21.350
He turns and Sprint's out of the underworld chased by the roaring flames

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:28.970
The fire burns underneath the earth and all the water boils Maui chants a magic incantation that brings rain

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:36.859
To put out the fires after the rain stops Mejia gathers up the last remnants of the fire and hides it in

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.090
Tiny pieces in the Bark's of different trees after this fiasco

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:47.599
Maui and his brothers see the Ailey birds who belonged to their mother making fires to cook their food

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:52.520
But every time the brothers get near the Ailee put out their fire and fly away

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:58.039
Realizing that the birds must know where the fire is hidden now he concocts a plan now

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.520
He makes a dummy of himself and props it up in his community

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.919
He pushes the canoe out into the water and hides the birds see his dummy sail away

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.190
And whip up a fire to cook their bananas now

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:17.059
He leaps from his hiding spot and grabs the oldest Ailee burned shaking it by the neck and demanding to know the secret of fire

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.729
Finally it spills the fiery beans

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:26.780
Rub together the bark of the how and the sandalwood trees, and you'll always be able to make fire

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.229
That's a big old fiery check. Thank you thought bubble

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:37.219
Six kun aloha the long eel Maui's sixth deed is a quicken the long

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:38.700
eel kun Aloha is

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:41.540
terrorising he of the fire so Maui kills it and

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:48.890
Chops it up into many pieces all the pieces squirm around and become fish and other eels and that explains why there's so many fish

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:54.830
In the seas around the Pacific Islands boom fish chicken of the sea check seven

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.900
immortality last episode Heracles was promised immortality if he finished his Labor's for

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.689
Maui's final task he aims even higher

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:05.450
He wants to gain immortality not only for himself

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.270
but

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:14.210
All of humanity it all starts when Maui learns about the Goblin got us Hina Nui keepo who brings death to all creatures?

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.999
Now he hears that if he can steal her heart and give it out to the creatures of Earth. They'll all become

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:28.369
Immortal, but now he is scared the goddess is more powerful than anything he's tussled with so he asks the ailee

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:35.150
If they'll come and be his backup he explains to the birds when the goddess is asleep. We're gonna creep in through

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:36.960
her mouth

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.960
past her vulcanic a glass teeth

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:47.270
Down to her heart to steal it, but when we're inside you can't make a sound not a single

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.070
First

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:55.640
Everything goes according to plan now. He makes it past the goddesses jaws through her stomach and grabs her heart

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:02.000
he turns around climbs back towards freedom and just as he makes it to her mouth a

00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:08.630
Bird tweets the goddess wakes up instantly and feels Maui in her mouth she bites down and there

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:17.510
Now he dies so now he fails his final task, but maybe in this case the failure is the lesson

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.090
Immortality sounds nice, but it isn't meant for humans, or as Thoth, and I sometimes call them mortals

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.789
Maybe it's better to learn to accept our own mortality

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:30.679
Lest we get chomped by a goddess Maui is kind of a curious figure sometimes

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.659
capable sometimes clumsy sometimes strong sometimes scared sometimes clever sometimes dumb

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.779
He and Heracles have more than a few things in common

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:45.380
I'd say they both do impossible deeds sure but they're not one-trick heroes either look at you Aquaman

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:47.390
Just kidding Jason Momoa is gonna. Crush it

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:54.889
This is one of the things that sets studying mythology apart from studying literature or fiction when your hero is a mythological hero

00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:58.219
It means they've been constructed by entire cultures sometimes

00:11:58.829 --> 00:12:01.698
multiple cultures and passed down orally over

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:08.269
Generations that's very different than a character whipped up by a professional screenwriter and voiced by the rock

00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:13.128
We can't look to myths for the same storytelling experience that we get from a Disney cartoon

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:20.449
But myths and their variations allow us to think about what stories come into being and why they remain popular

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:22.499
Whether the stories are about

00:12:22.499 --> 00:12:29.538
Discovering fire creating new zeland or just getting in a fight with your mom's door jamb and winning check next week

00:12:29.539 --> 00:12:35.659
It's time for a big transition. We're moving on to mythical places. Thanks for watching and see you in Eton
