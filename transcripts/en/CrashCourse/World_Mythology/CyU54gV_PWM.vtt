Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta and this is
Crashcourse Mythology.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:09.019
Today we’re going to try to do justice to
the Norse pantheon--a very scary wolf, an

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.090
amazing tree, a rainbow bridge, some frost
giants, and way more than what I learned from
reading Thor comics.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.140
No, not you, Thoth.
Your th is a plosive.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.920
We’re talking voiceless dental fricative here.
THOR.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.980
You know, this joke might work better in print.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:34.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.260
We met some of the Norse gods when we looked
at one of their creation stories.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.540
The source for that myth, and many other stories
from Norse mythology, is the Prose Edda, an

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.760
Icelandic compendium written by the amazingly-named
Snorri Sturluson around 1220 CE.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.230
This means that one of our main sources for
the tales of Germanic and Scandinavian gods

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.280
and goddesses comes from the far edge of their
world.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.910
It’s also important because the Prose Edda
is relatively NEW.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.320
So one rainbow bridge we’re going to have
to cross here is the way that later Christian

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.850
ideas influence the existing version of these
myths.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.330
Partly because of Snorri, there’s a tendency
to think of Norse mythology as belonging to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.750
Scandinavia, but that’s not quite right.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.170
The Norse Pantheon has roots in the religion
and mythology of Germanic people who migrated

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.170
into Europe.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.840
The Romans, especially our pal Tacitus, recorded
what they understood of the Germanic tribes’

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.620
beliefs, but they translated Germanic gods
into their own terms.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.530
So Wotan, or Wodan, who we’re calling Odin,
became associated with Mercury.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.070
Tyr, or Tiwaz, a warrior god, became associated
with the Roman god of war, Mars.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.370
And Thor was Jupiter or Jove.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.070
In their own terms, there are two sets of
Norse deities: first, the Vanir, associated

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920
with the earth and fertility.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.920
They’re the older set of gods.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.240
And second, the Aesir, associated with the
sky.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.440
The Vanir were led by Freyr and Freya, brother
and sister and also king and queen.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.479
They were the children of Njord.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.879
Who also has a terrific name.

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.879
According to Sturluson: “Freyr is an exceedingly
famous god; he decides when the sun shall

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.849
shine and when the rain come down, and along
with that the fruitfulness of the earth,

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.049
and he is good to invoke for peace and plenty.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.379
He also brings about the prosperity of men.”

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:32.129
So he is definitely the god you want to honor
if you’re having a picnic.

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.529
(Well, him and Amateratsu, Japanese sun goddess.

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.459
And while we’re at it, why not also Aphrodite,
because EVERYONE HAS A THING FOR.. ok you

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.499
get it)
The Vanir and the Aesir warred, but eventually

00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:48.879
reconciled and the Vanir came to live in Asgard,
one of the nine mythical Norse worlds.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.109
Although they also have their own realm, Vanaheim.

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.030
Not to be confused with Anaheim, the realm
of Walt Disney, Oranges, and Online Video

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.030
conferences.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.769
If you want the Euhumerist opinion, or, where
we take mythology as an explanation of historical

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.659
fact, this war may reflect a time where there
were two competing religions among the tribal

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.900
people of the north, which eventually teamed
up.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.159
Vanir and Aesir, stronger together!

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.159
Like Voltron!

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.319
But GODS.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.379
Another Norse god is Heimdall, also called
the White God.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.499
He’s associated with the sea because nine
waves birthed him... must have been a chaotic

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:27.029
day in the maternity ward.

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:31.909
Heimdall was the sentry of the gods and the
archenemy of Loki, who you might know from

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.349
his role as Tom Hiddleston.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.120
According to Sturluson, “[Heimdall] needs
less sleep than a bird and can see a hundred

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.409
leagues in front of him as well by night as
by day.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:47.449
He can hear the grass growing on the earth
and the wool on the sheep and everything that

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:48.620
makes noise.”

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.159
Boy, poor Heimdall.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.340
Imagine going to a dinner party and listening
to everyone chew.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.449
Some traditions place Heimdall in the Aesir,
some in the Vanir.

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.689
The Vanir are also associated with a golden
boar said to travel above and below the earth

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:05.109
like the sun.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.659
Gullinbursti, as it was called, appeared on
warriors’ crests and helmets, especially

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.059
in Uppsala.

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.639
Just like in Greece and Egypt, different gods
in the Norse pantheon were worshipped in different

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:16.639
regions.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.579
Thor is probably the most famous of the Aesir.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.349
Probably the second most famous is Odin, Thor’s
dad.

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.620
Odin is the father god, who was associated
with war, especially with the raw, almost

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.360
ecstatic warrior rage of berserkers.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.890
He was also a wizard who swayed battles through
magic.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:42.129
Imagine, like, Gandalf, but with one eye,
lots of muscles, an unhealthy desire for arcane

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:43.540
wisdom and a bit of a mean streak.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.919
Odin inherited his warrior-god nature from
his Germanic predecessors, Wodan and Tiwaz.

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.169
As Kevin Crossley-Holland remarked: “A culture
finds the gods it needs and the Norse world

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.280
needed a god to justify the violence that
[was] one of its hallmarks.”

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.099
Basically, if you’re a warlike society,
a war god is pretty convenient.

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.930
Odin inspired victory and foresaw defeat with
his shamanistic precognition . He was also

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.939
the god of poetry who travelled to the land
of the Giants, Jotunheim, to drink the mead

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:20.060
of poetry and bring it back to the Aesir and
Vanir.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.030
MMMM… poetry mead.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.720
Another part of Odin’s story is his sacrifice
and re-birth as a wiser god.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.180
According to one version he hung himself from
the world tree so he could drink the mead

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.180
of wisdom.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.960
Guess Odin couldn’t stop at just one mead,
huh?

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.960
This was when he sacrificed his eye, too.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.419
Odin was married to Frigg, a goddess who could
also see the future.

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.020
Odin’s children were Thor, whose mother
was the Earth itself, Baldr, the most beautiful

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:53.740
of the gods who was killed by Hodr his blind
brother, and Tyr, although one source has

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.229
Tyr’s father as the giant Hymir.

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.449
In some stories Baldr is a human warrior favored
by Odin.

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.879
Baldr is “the wisest of the gods, and the
sweetest-spoken, and the most merciful, but

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:10.039
it is a characteristic of his that once he
has pronounced a judgment it can never be

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.039
altered.”

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.780
Odin has another son, Hermod the bold, who
was sent to retrieve Baldr from a city in

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:20.730
the underworld, Nifelheim, ruled by the goddess
Hel, yup, that’s Hel with a single hockey

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:21.730
stick.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:26.020
And she was said to be a daughter of Loki,
who also helped kill Baldr.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.750
Loki is confusing.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.699
It’s never clear whether he’s a god or
a giant, or even whether he’s good or evil.

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:36.870
He has been called the son of two giants,
but also the foster-brother of Odin.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.909
He’s a trickster, so maybe his uncertain
pedigree makes some sense?

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:45.069
He’s also a thief, but also also sometimes
helps the Aesir.

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.669
He’s the father of several monsters including
the World Serpent, Jormungand, the wolf, Fenrir,

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:51.669
and Hel.

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:54.040
Not to put too fine a point on it, but Loki
is.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.040
the.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.040
worst.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.270
as we’ll see in our episode on … Ragnarok!

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.409
The mythical event.

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:01.580
Not the comic book event.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:02.580
Not the movie event.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.090
Not even the Gwar record.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:06.069
Just the literal end of the world.

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.169
Tyr is identified with war and justice.

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:13.430
In some traditions, he’s also a son of Odin,
but as you’ve probably noticed, it’s not

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.389
exactly easy to pin down parentage in the
Norse world.

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.389
Blame those nine waves.

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:22.550
Tyr’s position as a god of both war and
justice is interesting, given what we learned

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.889
about Vikings in Crashcourse World History.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.800
While known for their fearsome raiding, Vikings
also had a strict legal code with certain

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.360
elements of democratic governance.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.069
And they were really into skiing.

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:37.740
There are other gods in the Norse pantheon,
but they don’t really feature much.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.830
Bragi, a son of Odin, was another god of poetry,
while Ull was concerned mainly with archery

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:44.219
and hitting the slopes, brah.

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:45.219
Yup.

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:46.219
There’s a god of skiing.

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:48.750
There’s Vali, Odin’s son who avenged Baldr’s
death.

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.520
And Vidar, son of Odin and the giantess Grid,
avenged Odin’s death.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.710
I need an infographic.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.159
Oh, great.

00:07:57.159 --> 00:08:01.139
The Norse goddesses are relatively minor figures
in the myths.

00:08:01.139 --> 00:08:03.289
Freya is the only one who seems to have personality.

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:05.219
She’s a goddess of love.

00:08:05.219 --> 00:08:09.229
Faithfulness to her husband, Freyr, is not
her strong suit.

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:12.469
Her strong suit is definitely her amazing
feather jacket.

00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:16.389
She also has A CAT DRAWN CHARIOT.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:17.389
That is not a joke.

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:21.949
And like Freya, goddess Geifon is one of the
Vanir and she is associated with ploughing

00:08:21.949 --> 00:08:22.949
and fertility.

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:26.500
Eir is a goddess of healing, Sjofn and Lofn
are also goddesses of love.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.870
Var punishes those who betray their marriage
oaths and nothing can be hidden from her.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.930
Syn, with a Y, is a goddess associated with
justice.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:39.730
And who couldn’t love a goddess named Snotra,
who is associated with wisdom and self-discipline.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.840
And also head colds.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.290
THANKS I’LL BE HERE ALL WEEK!

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.350
Snortra stands in contrast with Saga, goddess
of poetry, whose main role seems to be Odin’s

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.350
drinking companion.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:49.350
Skål!

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.170
Frigg is Odin’s wife and the mother of multiple
gods, but we don’t know much about her.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:58.900
She is a maternal goddess who mourns the loss
of her son Baldr, and was invoked by women

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:00.010
in labor.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.730
Like Odin, she seemed to be able to know the
future.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:03.730
Now!

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:04.730
On to a myth.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.820
I’m going to be honest: Norse myths are
like the frat party of mythology.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.790
There’s a lot of fighting and drinking and
laughing, though no beer pong.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.120
First, some quick backstory.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.690
Odin championed warriors, picking his favorites
and sending Valkyries to bring them to Valhalla,

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.160
which seems like a nifty way to travel.

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.520
Thor was the god of farmers, and there were
a lot of farmers in Scandinavia.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.410
But he was also a mighty warrior, huge with
a giant red beard.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.540
Not so bright, but who needs smarts when you’re
the god of thunder and lightning?

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:41.880
He protected the Aesir and Vanir from the
giants, and in a stunning bit of surely coincidental

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.880
wordplay...

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:47.050
Mjollnir, his famous hammer was also a symbol
... of fertility.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.810
Let’s go to the Thoughtbubble.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.900
One day Thor woke up and couldn’t find his
hammer.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.450
He sent Loki to locate it.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.740
Loki borrowed Freya’s sweet falcon jacket,
turned it into an actual falcon and went searching.

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:03.190
He found his way to the hall of the giant
Thrym, who said that he had stolen Thor’s

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:07.360
hammer and he wouldn’t give it back unless
Freya agreed to marry him.

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.590
Freya said, over my dead body.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:14.960
So, Heimdall, the sentry god, came up with
a brilliant idea: Put Thor in a wedding dress

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.470
and have him pretend to be Freya!

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:22.770
The other gods laughed and Thor sulked, but
Loki prevailed on him because without his

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.310
hammer, the gods were vulnerable to giants.

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.430
So they found a giant wedding dress and a
thick veil and headed off to Jotunheim.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:34.600
Once there, Thrym threw his new bride and
her bridesmaid, Loki, a wedding feast.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:40.270
Thor ate an entire ox, eight salmon, all the
sweets and three horns of mead.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.670
When Thrym commented that he’d never seen
a woman eat so much, Loki explained that “Freya”

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:49.350
was so excited to be married that she hadn’t
eaten for eight days.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:54.880
Thrym seemed satisfied, but then he peeked
under her veil and saw his bride’s glowing

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.200
red eyes.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.410
Loki again reassured Thrym that his bride
was so excited that she hadn’t slept for

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.530
seven days.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:07.170
Finally, Thrym offered up Mjollnir as a wedding-symbol,
saying: “Put Mjollnir between her knees

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:10.700
so that Var will hear our marriage oath and
give her blessing.”

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.890
As soon as the hammer was placed between his
knees, Thor snatched it up, ripped off his

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:16.940
veil and did what he does best: clobber giants.

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:21.620
He crushed Thyrm’s skull and killed every
other giant at the wedding feast, including

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.620
the women.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.970
The tale ends: “And so Thor, son of Odin,
won back his hammer.”

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.550
Thanks Thoughtbubble, that was awesome.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.550
And disturbing.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.440
And of course, soaked in mead and blood.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.860
Norse gods, like Greek ones, are all too human,
and seem to misbehave accordingly.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.100
But unlike other mythic traditions, the Norse
sagas seem to lean less heavily on metaphor--they’re

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.750
rollicking adventure tales, perfect for Vikings,
lusty warriors who like nothing more than

00:11:48.750 --> 00:12:10.020
a roasted ox, a few horns of ale, and a good
punch-up.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:34.490
And skiing.

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:44.380
Thanks for watching, see you next time.
