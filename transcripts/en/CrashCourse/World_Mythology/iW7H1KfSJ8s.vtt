Hey there, I'm Mike Rugnetta! This is Crash Course Mythology and today

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.120
We're going to talk about the dying god, a specific archetype of god that might seem counterintuitive,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.260
considering lots of the myths we've already talked about feature gods who are immortal.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:22.520
The dying god trope, though, is one found in many regions throughout the world, but especially in the Greco-Hellenistic Roman World, which includes Egypt.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.680
Don't worry, though! Thoth is fine, he's just more like a death secretary. Alright, let's go.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:37.740
*Crash Course Intro*

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.120
The dying god is, you guessed it, a god who dies and is often but not always reborn.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420
Sometimes gods die for the benefit of their people, in which case,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.780
they're a savior as we discussed in a previous episode. Other times,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.840
the god is reborn actually or symbolically. So these stories also have

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.380
something in common with the myths that represent regeneration or seasonal rebirth.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.340
In the west, the most well-known story of a dying god is, of course, the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.860
We're not going to get into that one here because it's a widely studied story that y'all are likely familiar with.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.600
Instead, let's start with an iconic dying god from Ancient Greece.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.140
The Story of Adonis.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.300
Nowadays, calling some dude an Adonis is shorthand for saying that he is super hot.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.440
But, originally, Adonis was the Greco-Roman Version of a semitic God,  sometimes Identified with Osiris.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.140
In Semitic languages like Hebrew, Adonis's Name is Adonai or Lord.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.320
So Adonis's significance goes way beyond killer abs.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.600
In some versions of the Adonis's story, his mother was a virgin.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.920
In others, he's the result of incest between his mother and her father, the King.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.240
Still, other versions claim that Adonis may have been born out of a myrrh tree.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.680
So, for those of you keeping track at home, we've had

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.880
several brain baby, a thigh baby, one stone baby and now our first tree birth.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.560
Probably the best known version of the Adonis myth comes from Ovid's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.040
metamorphoses which details Venus's mad love for the beautiful young god.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.020
However, we can't give Adonis all the credit.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.060
Venus only fell for him after one of Cupid's arrows grazed her breast.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.180
She leaves Olympus to chase Adonis around the wood.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.920
She warned him not to be too risky in his hunting, but as you can probably guess,

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.620
Adonis does not listen. He's killed by a boar that gore him in the groin,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.420
Ouch.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.220
When she finds him dying, Venus is distraught.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.360
Brutal.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.260
Venus, history's first black metal lyricist.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.680
She, then, sprinkles nectar on Adonis's blood and it transforms into a red anemone flower.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.220
This flower is born, lives, dies and is reborn again - each year - like flowers do,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.980
so it's a symbolic reminder of the cyclical nature of the seasons and perhaps, our grief.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.440
Thoth - you get all misty-eyed or is it just allergies?

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.120
Seeing the same flower die every year might be kind of sad, but in another way, it's a hopeful symbol,

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.580
for the idea that maybe death isn't final after all.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.200
Now, let's turn to one of the most famous dying gods, our friend Odin,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.880
who hanged himself from the World Tree - Yggdrasil - as a sacrifice in order to gain  the Knowledge of Runes.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.020
He doesn't really die in most versions of the myth, but he does suffer.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.400
Both from hanging and from being pierced in the side with a sword.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.320
Note the parallels with the death of Jesus here #dyinggods

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.880
There's also Balder, a Norse god, who actually does die.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.740
Like Adonis, Balder is often described as beautiful and beloved by all the gods

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.380
Except, of course, for Loki, who as I may have mentioned is: the worst.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.380
Loki was jealous of Balder's popularity and schemed to have him killed

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.350
by the one thing that he was vulnerable to: you're not going to guess what it is

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.720
It's mistletoe.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.660
So think of that at the next office Christmas Party, hm?

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.780
His mother, Frigg, had gotten every substance on Earth to swear not to bring harm to Balder,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:17.880
except from mistletoe,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.840
because she thought that it didn't matter.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.900
Loki crafted a dart from mistletoe and got the blind god,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.520
Hodr, to throw it at Balder while everyone else was having fun throwing stuff at him

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.420
because he's invulnerable.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.519
Norse gods sure do know how to party.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.869
Balder dies and goes down to single hockey stick, Hell, the place.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.380
His mother asks for volunteers to try to bring him back and

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.920
Balder's brother, Hermod steps up,  saddles up and rides down to hell.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.800
Hel, the person who minds Hell, the place,  isn't particularly moved.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.140
But as underworld gods are often want to do she decides to make a deal.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.940
She says that if everyone on Earth will weep for Balder and she'll let him return.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.280
Turns out, Balder was so beloved that everyone and everything on Earth did weep for him,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.940
Except for one giantess named Thokk who says,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.260
Harsh, Thokk. What Balder ever do to you? Jeez.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.220
So Balder doesn't come back from the dead all because of Thokk.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.360
Though, if you ask the other gods, they'll point out something very interesting,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.780
isn't Loki, who's the worst, a shapeshifter

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.080
And have you ever seen him and Thokk in the same room? Just Saying.

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.480
These are the reasons Loki Is the worst.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.420
Far from being a bittersweet reminder of life's impermanence,

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.440
Balder's death foreshadows Ragnarok, the literal Death and Rebirth of everything.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.100
More on that in a few episodes.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.435
(If the world doesn't end)

00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.360
The story of the Corn Mother, a great goddess from native American Mythology is one where the dying god,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.400
specifically makes sacrifices in order to bring salvation to her people.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.420
Thought Bubble, this one's a little grisly but we think he can handle it.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.820
The first mother was born from a drop of dew during the time when the All-Maker was creating all sorts of things.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:20.080
She was a beautiful young woman who upon being born proclaimed,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.260
All-Maker certainly loved her and together they bore the first people.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.120
Following All-Maker's instructions, the people learned to hunt.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.880
In time, they became so good at it that they exhausted all the game on the Earth.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.260
Then, the people began to starve and this made the first mother very sad because

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.280
she had made the people and now couldn't do anything to help.

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.020
Her husband didn't want to see the first mother so sad and asked

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.075
what he could do to stop her weeping.

00:06:48.075 --> 00:06:51.240
The first mother replied with the only thing he could do:

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:52.710
Kill her.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.020
Her husband refused at first but eventually

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.880
he relented and asked the first mother, how he should do it,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.600
first mother told him that when the sun was at its highest point,

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.060
he should kill her and have two of her sons dragged her by the hair

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:10.760
over the barren Earth until all the flesh had been scraped from her body, then

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.720
they were to take her bones and bury them and wait seven months before returning.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.260
At this time, their mother's flesh would feed the people. The husband and son did what the first mother said and waited

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:28.340
sadly for seven months to return to the place where first mother's flesh had been stripped from her bone.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:35.340
There they found plants with tassels of hair, silky like the first mother's and sweet fruit that they could eat.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:41.260
This was corn and as the first mother promised, it fed the people. From then on,

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:45.500
her sacrifice being repeated and renewed every seven months.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.780
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.160
After the discovery of corn, the people of Earth went back to the place where they'd

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.080
buried her bones and they found another plant with sacred leaves,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.520
that when burned would clear their minds and help them with their prayers.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.160
This was tobacco.

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:05.680
So, thanks? Yeah that one's a lot more tricky, just ask...

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.840
Well we're gonna get to trickster gods in the next episode.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.760
So, the first mother now called the Corn Mother

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.040
saved the native American people from starvation. There's an amazing blend of archetypes in this story.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.040
Obviously, there's the Earth Mother who gave birth to humanity, and cares for them.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.300
Like human mothers, she weeps at her helplessness when her children suffer and she's willing to sacrifice anything,

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:29.308
including her body so that her children will survive.

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:35.940
In this sacrifice, she also plays the role of the savior which is more typically a role performed by male gods in myths.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.880
The Corn Mother is also a culture hero, her sacrifice transforms a hunting people into an agricultural people,

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.440
though many native Americans in North America pursued both hunting and agriculture simultaneously

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.140
as means of subsistence.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:55.880
The Corn Mother here by providing an alternative form of food enabled the animals to recover, providing game for the people.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:01.200
And in addition to providing food,  the Corn Mother gave the people tobacco which became an important part

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.620
of their religious ritual and other practices. Many of the dying god stories involve cycles,

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.240
whether it's Adonis and the annual flower or the corn Mother and the annual harvest,

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:14.800
these stories remind us that birth is often twinned with death,

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.860
which may make the latter inevitability easier to accept,

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:25.320
and the Corn Mother story adds an extra layer in reminding us that motherly sacrifices enable all life.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.300
We've seen the idea of god sacrificing themselves as the foundation of Creation before,

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:37.300
Tongu's body became the Earth's, the body and bones of Amir became the Earth's and the Mountains, and his skull became the sky

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:43.520
Gaia gave birth to the mountains of the oceans. It's not surprising that throughout most of human history,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:49.020
when child birth was much more likely to end in the mother's death, that we find stories

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.040
where gods sacrificed themselves so that humans can live.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.170
