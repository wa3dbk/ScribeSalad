00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.360
Hey there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash
Course Mythology, and today we’re gonna

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.420
put on our mythical coats, grab our mythical
hats, hop on a mythical mode of public transportation

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.250
and get ourselves into the hustle and bustle
of mythical cities.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.429
Some of these cities are real, some are fictional,
and some are even metaphorical.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:18.020
But all of them are metropolitain!

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.020
Come on, Thoth!

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.560
The Bifrost Bus only runs once an hour!

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.770
[Intro]
City myths can be tricky.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.739
They’re not like other mythical places we’ve
looked at-- like gardens, caves, or mountains--because

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.030
they don’t belong to the natural world.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.350
They’re man made, or sometimes god made.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.250
And this means that the stories we tell about
them can be a little different.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.400
A lot of the stories we have about cities
are closer to tall tales, which are fun, but

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.800
they don’t meet our criteria for myth, mostly
because they’re, well...a little unserious.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.120
A good example of a tall tale city is El Dorado,
the city of gold said to exist somewhere in

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.850
South America, that really tended to be more
of a metaphor for some ultimate prize that

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.829
one may search for endlessly… but likely
never actually attain.

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.420
And some urban tales are almost too serious--they’re
places that really existed, with archaeological

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.280
evidence and complicated histories that transcend
the stories we tell about them.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.549
Probably the best known of these is Troy,
whose siege is described in the Iliad.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.609
The archaeological history of Troy is fascinating,
but I’ll leave that for Crashcourse Archaeology.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:29.609
Just kidding.

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:30.609
There’s no Crashcourse Archeology.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:31.840
[[[Thoth comes on like Indiana Jones.]]]

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.579
Or maybe we just haven’t discovered it yet.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.700
Another significant archeological city that
has a mythical story attached to it is Jericho.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.501
Jericho is one of the oldest cities in human
history, but is probably best known for the

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:49.109
story of its destruction at the hands of Joshua
in the Old Testament.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.279
According to the story, the Lord tells Joshua
to march around the city walls for six days

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:59.859
with seven priests blowing ram’s horns as
they carry the ark of the covenant, a chest

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.279
that contains the ten commandments.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.999
On the seventh day, following the Lord’s
instructions, Joshua has the army march around

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:13.379
the city seven times and on the seventh circuit
he has the trumpets sound and the army shout

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.970
its war cry.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.030
According to the book of Joshua, chapter 6,
verse 20:

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.849
“When the trumpets sounded, the army shouted,
and at the sound of the trumpet, when the

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:31.209
men gave a loud shout, the wall collapsed;
so everyone charged straight in, and they

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.209
took the city.”

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.719
It’s a great story, but archaeologists are
still arguing over whether or not a walled

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.019
city even existed at the time of Joshua.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.890
And even if it did exist, trumpets probably
didn’t bring it down.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.670
Looking at things etiologically, as we sometimes
do, is fun, but it isn’t ALWAYS possible

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.790
to reconcile myths and historical remains.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.709
This is especially true of living cities,
which have to go about their business while

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.780
also existing as a repository of stories about
them.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.299
Let’s start with a holy site mentioned in
the Bible, but still standing today, a holy

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.360
site common to all three Abrahamic religions:
Jerusalem.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.180
It might be an understatement to say that
Jerusalem has been the subject of many stories.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.999
And the imagery used to describe Jerusalem
changes dramatically depending upon who’s

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.609
doing the describing and when.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.910
Sometimes the city is beautiful, sometimes
ugly.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.569
Sometimes Jerusalem is personified as a not
especially reputable mythic woman.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.300
This is particularly true during the Babylonian
captivity, a time in the 6th century BCE when

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:40.170
the babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar kept
sacking Jerusalem and sending Jews into exile.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.469
This all led to some complicated feelings
about Jerusalem.

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.790
The lamentations of Jeremiah begin:

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.980
How doth the city sit solitary, that was full
of people!

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.959
She is become as a widow, that was great among
the nations!

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.170
She that was a princess among the provinces
is become tributary!

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.170
(1:1)
Okay.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.040
A tributary.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.390
Not so bad.

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.389
But then it gets unpleasant, Jeremiah continues:

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:16.569
Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore
she is become as an unclean thing;

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.489
All that honored her despise her, because
they have seen her nakedness:

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.560
Yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.980
Her filthiness was in her skirts; she remembered
not her latter end;

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.960
Therefore is she come down wonderfully; she
hath no comforter: (1:8-9)

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
Yeah I mean, Jeremiah’s ambivalence is maybe
understandable.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.430
It’s hard to see your sacred city conquered
and destroyed.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.410
Though as for Jeremiah comparing the city
to a lewd and unclean woman, it’s not the

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.340
only time the Bible deploys the female image
unfairly.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.009
But maybe we can read it as a lamentation
for a city that was supposed to nurture him

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.020
but is now taunting him and other Jews by
harboring their conquerors.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.699
The Jews eventually go back and rebuild Jerusalem
so hopefully some of these feelings abate.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.990
In the New Testament, Jerusalem is described
as a woman again, but this woman is more…

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.539
well, clean.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.740
In the Book of Revelation, John invents an
idealized Jerusalem, a New Jerusalem intended

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.819
as a new spiritual home.

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:22.590
In chapter 12 he says:

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.650
And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem,
coming down out of heaven from God, prepared

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.440
as a bride adorned for her husband.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.740
(Rev 21:2)
So which is it?

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.020
Bride or harlot covered in filth? ... both?

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.150
Some cities in the Bible are often classed
as places of sin -- Sodom and Gomorrah being

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.520
the most obvious example -- but let’s not
forget: cities also provide opportunities

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.639
for humankind to unite.

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.360
For the early Christians, the ideal city wasn’t
Jerusalem, but Rome.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.430
We haven’t talked a great deal about Roman
mythology in this series, largely because

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.050
it draws heavily on Greek sources, but Romans
did create their own mythological history,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.460
particularly for their city.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.870
We’re going to look at two important myths
surrounding the founding of Rome, involving,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.140
you might be shocked to learn: families and
violence.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.379
One story of the foundation of Rome comes
from Virgil’s epic poem, The Aeneid.

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:22.560
This is the story of the Trojan hero, Aeneas,
who escapes the sack of Troy with his aged

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:27.090
father, his young son, and statues of his
household gods.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:30.610
Eventually he makes his way to Italy where
he and his group of Trojans settle.

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:35.110
There, Aeneas marries Lavinia, the daughter
of the king of Latium.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.610
Anchises, Aeneas’s dad, dies during the
journey, but in book six of the Aeneid, Aeneas

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.550
goes to the underworld and his father explains
to him the future history of Rome.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.650
Anchises mentions a future descendant called
Romulus:

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:55.180
“Of him, my son,
Great Rome shall rise, and, favored of his

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.970
star,
Have power world-wide, and men of godlike

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.080
mind.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.569
She clasps her seven hills in single wall,
Proud mother of the brave”

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.050
That’s right, it’s not Aeneas who founds
Rome.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:15.099
It’s his son who settles at Alba Longa,
and a later descendant–Romulus–who builds

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:17.020
the city of seven hills.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:22.159
But hold the mythical phone for just a moment...
who is this “Romulus”?

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:26.449
The story of Romulus and his twin brother
Remus begins in Alba Longa where a woman named

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:28.480
Rhea Silvia lives.

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.460
Unfortunately for Rhea, Mars, the god of war,
is obsessed with her.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.699
And after cornering her in a sacred grove
he “seduces” her -- which, I mean, let’s

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:40.590
be real, probably he rapes her.

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.120
Now pregnant, Rhea goes to her uncle, King
Amulius, for help.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.580
But Amulius is furious.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.719
Instead of helping his niece, he imprisons
her.

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:55.789
When she finally gives birth, he orders her
twin sons to be left to die on the bank of

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:56.789
the Tiber river.

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:02.169
Abandoned, the twins are suckled by a gentle
she-wolf until they’re found by a shepherd

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:05.189
named Faustulus who raises them.

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:09.530
Probably because of their early troubled life–oh
but also because they were sort of raised

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.380
by a wolf?–the boys turn to crime, eventually
stealing some of Amulius’s sheep.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.789
Remus is captured and taken before Amulius
for trial.

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:24.160
At this point, Faustulus reveals to Romulus
the brothers’ true identities.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:29.790
Romulus, in good criminal-hero fashion, sets
off for Alba Longa to get revenge on his great-uncle

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:30.790
the king.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:34.130
Romulus kills Amulius and rescues Remus.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:38.520
He gives the vacant throne to Amulius’s
grandfather Numitor and then the twins go

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.960
off to found their own city, which brings
us to the Thoughtbubble.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:48.610
Romulus and Remus decide where they were abandoned,
on the banks of the Tiber, would be a great

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:53.410
place for a new city, but they can’t agree
on the exact location.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:59.111
Romulus receives a sign from the gods telling
him to choose the Palatine hill as the site,

00:08:59.111 --> 00:09:02.630
so he sets out to mark the boundaries by digging
a ditch.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.050
Remus sets up camp opposite him on the Aventine
hill.

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:11.360
Remus, the more headstrong of the two brothers,
jumps over the ditch to show Romulus that

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.610
it’s not exactly invasion proof.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:21.090
Romulus, seeing this as sacrilege, kills his
brother and becomes the sole ruler of the

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.090
new city.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:25.320
That’s why it’s called “Rome” and
not “Reem” and I think we’re all thankful

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.320
for that.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.820
Imagine being a REEMAN instead of a ROMAN.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:29.820
BUGH.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:36.570
So Romulus has a spot for his city and no
rival twin, but he still has one big problem:

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.570
not enough people.

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:42.810
So he puts out the word that the hill will
be a refuge for the criminals and runaways

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.970
of Italy.

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.200
And that’s exactly who shows up.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:53.040
Roman historian Livy calls them “a miscellaneous
rabble, without distinction of bond or free.”

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:59.320
But that rabble is almost entirely male, and
in order to populate the city, Romulus and

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.960
the city leaders invite visitors from neighboring
cities to celebrate a harvest festival with

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.040
them.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:12.550
After the visitors arrive, at a pre-arranged
signal, the Romans seize all the young women.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.810
And grow the Roman population through ... mass
rape.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.390
BUGH
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:24.190
These stories, like the ones in the Bible,
remind us how easily myths can gloss over

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.580
or sometimes even glamorize terribly violent
actions.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:33.620
The founding and conquering and defending
of cities can get really ugly.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.350
Some myths reflect this, others choose to
pretty up their origin stories with magic

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.350
and stuff.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:43.760
The story of Rome’s founding highlights
some of the complexity to be found in mythical

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.760
cities.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.350
Many cities have origin stories, some more
historically grounded than others.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.730
When we’re dealing with actual cities, that
have archaeological and written histories,

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:58.180
we often find that the myths surrounding the
city jibe with that history.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:02.662
Jericho was besieged and conquered at some
point, though it’s unlikely that trumpet

00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.280
blasts were responsible.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.220
Rome, built on the Palatine, and became the
seat of one of the most expansive empires

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.610
in the world.

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:15.190
One empire that relied on cunning and violence,
characteristics that we might easily ascribe

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:21.270
to its pro-wolf, pro-rape, pro-conquest, brother-murderer
of a founder.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.610
Cities are ambivalent, morally ambiguous places.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.620
Kind of like everywhere else people live.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.330
And with that, we’ve reached the border
of our final mythical place.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:34.810
Next episode, we move on to the first examination
of mythical beasts.

00:11:34.810 --> 00:12:20.770
Thanks for watching, I’ll see you next time.
