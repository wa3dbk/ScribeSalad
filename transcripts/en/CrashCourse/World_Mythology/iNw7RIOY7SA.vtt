00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Hey there I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology and today

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.849
We're continuing our round-the-world tour of mythical features of the natural world. Today we behold

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:15.020
trees and yes technically trees do appear in gardens like the ones in the Garden of Eden

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.660
but trees have a mythological richness all their own

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.120
Also they're so nice and shady they deserve an episode all to themselves. Right Thoth ?

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.179
He's so tranquil. Don't worry. We'll fix that

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.180
So, if you've been watching this series closely you'll remember some of the trees we've already met,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.360
like the tree of knowledge of good and evil from Eden that was the one tree

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.460
Yahweh told Adam and Eve not to eat from.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.780
And then they did. It's the one that hosted a serpent which told Eve to eat the knowledge Apple

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.300
- which might have actually been a quince or a fig or a pomegranate - and which filled Eve and Adam both with the knowledge

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.340
that they were naked. As you may recall that didn't work out well

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.620
and it's the reason we now have pain in childbirth and infinite weeding.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.120
But the tree of knowledge is hardly the only

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.180
mythically significant tree. We've also met Yggdrasil and we're about to encounter Aswatha, two trees which contain the whole of

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
cosmology in their roots and branches

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.300
We've talked a bit before about Yggdrasil, the great ash tree where Odin hangs himself to learn the secret of runes

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.469
Between the tips of its branches and its roots exists the entire

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.990
Cosmos, from the beginning to the end of time Yggdrasil has three

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.260
Great roots one reaching to Asgard where the æsir and white elves live one to Jotunheim

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.009
the home of men, dark elves, dwarves and giants and the last to Niffleheim where hell the person rules over the land of the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.560
dead hell the place. Yggdrasil is both a tree of knowledge and a tree of life

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.860
connecting and sustaining all the plains of the Norse universe. It's foretold to be one of the few things to survive

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.460
Ragnarok and from its bark

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.490
mankind will be renewed

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:13.000
Fittingly, Yggdrasil teams with life and activity. On its top branches lives an eagle and on top of that eagle a hawk.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.280
Down at the base of the tree lives Nidhogg (Níðhǫggr) a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.259
Dragon who gnaws on the roots of the tree and baddies on their way to hell. A naughty squirrel named Ratatosk lives among the branches

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.660
Carrying insults back and forth between the eagle and the dragon making them even more insulting along the way. Indian mythology also

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.500
Features a tree that represents the entire cosmos in the Vedas and the Upanishads we find a giant

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.920
Inverted tree whose roots reached to the sky and whose branches covered the earth

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.469
This cosmic tree Aswatha often called a Bodhi tree

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.789
represents Brahma the supreme a cosmic spirit in full and

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.169
Glorious bloom. Aswatha is further described in the Mahabharata which explains

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:02.828
"Sprung from the unmanifested arising from it only as support the tree's trunk is Bodhi

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:09.519
(enlightenment or awakening). Its inward cavities the channels of the sense the great elements its

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:15.189
branches the objects of the senses its leaves its fair flowers good and

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.689
evil pleasure and pain the consequent fruits. This

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.559
Eternal Brahma tree is the source of life for all beings."

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.819
Whether upside down or right side up these trees have particular structures

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.669
which can be interpreted as containing the entire universe while also providing delicious and

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.298
Occasionally dangerous snacks sometimes though these trees represent far less than the whole world or universe

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.819
trees are also often involved in myths about

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.780
personal transformation

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.069
And it makes sense trees have an annual cycle of change and many even seem to die and come back to life each year

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:55.539
We've already seen one tree transformation myth in the story of totes pal Osiris

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:59.199
Although that one is complicated because Osiris is entombed in a coffin

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.999
Which is then enclosed in a tree for another tree's formation?

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.179
we're heading to Greece for Daphne and Apollo the myth of Daphne and Apollo begins with Apollo making fun of

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.449
Eros whom you may know better as Cupid. Here's a tip though

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.918
Don't make fun of babies with a bow and arrow because babies with a bow and arrow are

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:25.029
Dangerous in revenge eros looses two magic arrows one of gold and one of lead. The gold one is for Apollo

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.139
And it makes him fall in love with the nymph Daphne. So far so cute

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:37.089
But then he shoots, Daphne with the lead arrow and as soon as Daphne sees Apollo. She is deeply and madly

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.689
disgusted by him Apollo pursues

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:48.399
Daphne and Daphne rejects him Apollo is persistent and Daphne keeps shooting him down mortal men might take the hint

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.060
But Apollo is a God and gods do not take hints before you know it Apollo is literally chasing Daphne across Greece

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:03.130
Not especially interested in the advances of a god she despises Daphne cries out to her father Finneus the river god for help

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.920
Asking him to make the earth swallow her up or transform her into something else

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:16.119
Both are preferable to sex with Apollo her dad goes for the transformation option turning daphne into a laurel tree

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.209
Apollo looks at the tree and realizes he

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:20.930
loves

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.630
This tree after some rather uncomfortable and unfortunate tree molesting

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.159
He decrees that the laurel will forever be his symbol and Daphne

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:32.810
Well, we don't know how Daphne feels about it

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:33.730
She's a tree now

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.390
But my guess is that she is not

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.899
Super thrilled with this outcome a different tree transformation myth takes us to a part of the world. We haven't visited yet

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:47.739
Vietnam. here the story of ton lung and Tao is both a transformation story and an etiological

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.260
story explaining a traditional Vietnamese

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.109
Marriage custom tun and lung are two brothers

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.380
They're not twins

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.219
But they're very very similar almost no one can tell them apart except for their friend Tao

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:06.100
The daughter of the village teacher she learns which brother is which by staring deeply into their eyes

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.950
she knows the older brother tun is the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.439
extroverted one while the young Lung is

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.820
Quiet and thoughtful one day Tao realizes that tun is in love with her before she knows what to do tons parents have come to

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.159
Ask for Tao's hand she and her parents

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.679
Agree Tun and Tao are married and Tao travels to live with her new husband's family

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:32.200
Tony is happily married, but still loves his younger brother so he tries to include Lung. Tun

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.969
AsksLung to come on walks with him and Tao, but the younger brother always refuses

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.839
Tao is sensitive to the emotions of the two brothers and one day she realizes that despite his quiet exterior, Lung is

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:50.560
Deeply in love with her eventually his desires become too much to bear so he moves to a remote mountain

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.890
To garden and to write, and I mean hey

00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:02.049
We've all been after ten days without his brother Tun is beside himself with worry and goes to search for him leaving Tao behind

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.700
After another 10 days Tao becomes worried and goes to search for the brothers

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:13.149
She heads to the mountains up a treacherous path to a river. That's too fast and wide to cross

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.299
There's no ferry and the weather is starting to turn so she knocks on the door of a nearby Hut

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.320
Let's find out what happens next

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.320
In the thought bubble inside the hut town meets a kindly old couple she asked them if they'd seen

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.830
Two men one dressed in white and the other in green yes

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.020
The old man says about a month ago my wife found a man dressed all in white sitting by the river

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.290
He was weeping and acting as if he was embracing someone

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:44.080
But it was only the air it began to rain so she came back to the house to fetch a rain jacket for him

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:49.240
I brought the rain jacket the old woman says and asked the man to put it on and join us in the house

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:55.210
He said nothing so I laid the jacket down beside me the next day the man in white wasn't there?

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:01.720
But where he had been sitting there was a strange white rock ten days later another man this one dressed in green

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.200
Came by and asked if they'd seen a man dressed in white

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:11.679
We showed him the rock and told him the story the old man says the man in green cried that his brother

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:19.329
Had turned to stone he embraced the rock and wept bitterly and when another storm came through he like his brother

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:26.050
Refused to leave the spot the next day the man in green was also gone and by the rock stood a new

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.379
Tree that had not been there before the tree seemed to be protecting the rock the next morning Tao

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:33.349
Goes down to the river

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:35.180
she kneels by the rock and

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:39.910
Embraces the tree crying into its leaves when the couple wakes up Tao is nowhere to be found

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:45.969
but they do find a new vine with its roots deep in the ground twisting up the tree as if

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:50.229
Embracing and supporting it and when the old couple pluck a leaf from the vine

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:55.479
It's smell reminds them the young woman who had spent the night in their Hut

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:59.919
Thanks, thought-bubble this sweet, but tragic story of love and devotion

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:07.510
Doesn't end there though one summer afternoon the king comes to the river and sits on the strange rock under the strange tree

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.280
Supported by the strange vine. He asks his attendant. What sort of tree

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:18.819
Is it and orders him to pick one of its fruits another attendant tells the king the story of Lung Tun and Tao?

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.770
Explaining the white rock represents lung pure heart the tree represents

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.489
Tuns attempt to protect his brother and the vine shows

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:32.489
Tao's Love for her husband the king tastes the fruit wrapped in the leaf of the vine

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.650
Mixed with a bit of the rock and finds the taste most agreeable strange

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.730
He enjoyed eating rocks

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.539
but afterward he declares that the love of these two brothers and the

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:46.140
married couple is so strong that it has produced a

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.150
Lovely fruit and from that point the fruit and the leaf and the rock would be used at marriage

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.880
proposals and weddings as a symbol of both love and fidelity mythological trees vary in size and

00:09:57.339 --> 00:10:04.109
Meaning some are large enough to contain the whole world others are slender plants meant to represent a single young woman or man

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.410
deciduous trees with their cycles of birth and death

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:11.669
Lend themselves to metaphor as does their shape with branches reaching towards the sky and roots

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:17.909
Burrowing into the ground trees can live for hundreds if not thousands of years much longer than humans

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:24.299
So it makes sense that they might come to represent something greater than the relatively frail human form

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:29.580
But poignantally they also serve as a retreat for Humanity when the sorrows of

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.589
Unrequited love or the threat of abuse become too much to endure

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:38.489
