00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is crash course Mythology and today

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.598
It's everybody back in the pool... or river... or storm drain overflow from Divine Rainstorms. That's right

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.859
It's our final flood episode and we're heading West to the Americas. Surf's up Thoth

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.460
We've already talked about floods from the ancient near east at the point between Europe, Africa, and Asia and last week we covered the floods

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.260
of China in East Asia, but it turns out that essentially anywhere there's a civilization

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.809
there's a story of that civilization being destroyed...

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.120
by water. One myth from the Inca Empire

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.440
should sound familiar at this point. Viracocha was the supreme god of the Incas and considered the father of the other gods and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
creator of the World. Viracocha

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.880
eventually became tired of the race of giants he created to populate the earth. He thought they were lazy and bad-tempered

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.829
And they always forgot his birthday, so I bet you can guess how he decided to get rid of those forgetful

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.629
Behemoths. That's right, a flood. Viracocha's flood rose up even higher

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.290
than the Andes Mountains high enough to drown the giants and in some versions all of humanity along with...

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.330
A single lucky couple survived by floating in a box. The box drifted to

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.319
Tiahuanaco. When it came to rest Viracocha made a new people with the

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.499
surviving couple. As a reminder of the flood we have lake Titicaca and lake Poopó although the latter

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:35.589
Disappeared in 2016 as a result of climate change and human diverting its waters for mining

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.470
So it's not just Viracocha who can destroy life in the Andes. No review of new World Myths would be complete

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.450
without a quick visit to the Popul Vuh

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.860
It's one of our best sources for understanding the world of the Mayans before the arrival of Europeans.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.909
You might remember from our creation myths episode that in Mesoamerica the deities went through a number of attempts at birthing the world before?

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.890
Getting it right. In the creation story

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.860
I recounted the animals that were created couldn't talk. No helpful dragons like Yu the Engineer had in China.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.720
So the gods started over and as it turns out the creator once messed up humans too.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.389
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. In the beginning the creator made

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.440
Humans out of wood. These wooden people could do a lot of things we can. Walk, talk, have children, build houses... let's not think too

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.619
Hard about out of what but they were dry and yellow and their faces had no expression because they had no minds

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.229
Nor souls nor hearts. They beat their dogs, and they burned the bottoms of their cooking pot

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:36.939
They had forgotten how they were made and couldn't remember any of the names of God, so he said these men will not do either

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.370
I must destroy them also- and really can you blame them? Dog beaters- unbelievable

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:49.029
so the creator sent- you guessed it- a great flood knocking down the houses of the wooden men. The wooden men tried to escape but

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.520
The animals they had starved and beaten and cooking pots they had burned and the trees with branches they had chopped off all

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.939
Turned against them and wouldn't help them; only a few of them escaped from their flood and it is said that their

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.619
Descendant are the monkeys this is why you should never let a monkey cook- no offense Thoth

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.380
After reflecting the creator said it is time

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.719
I need men on the earth who will know my names who will obey me and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.359
Love me that will nourish and sustain me

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.809
So he made a man out of cornmeal and used nine kinds of liquor to give strength to his new creations

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.490
He made four men and four women and they were very happy the creator was scared that these new creations might be too

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.359
Powerful though, so the creator blew a mist over their eyes and clouded their vision

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.540
But the people were still thankful. When the sun came up and the puma and the Jaguar roared the men and the women

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.290
Danced with Joy

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.819
Because they were alive and possibly drunk

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.670
Thanks
Thought-bubble the couple book creation that gives us insight into the troubling nature of creation and

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.529
Humanity. As in many of the other myths we've seen, there's something not quite right about

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.159
Mankind at first. the gods always want a big watery

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.969
Do-over this myth differs from those we saw in the mediterranean world in a few ways first off Viracocha didn't find any human beings

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.450
Sinless enough to spare also apparently only humans are victims of this flood it's a little bit weird since those

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:21.549
Humans are made of wood which usually floats- wouldn't fire work better? I probably would have gone with fire wait my vengeful

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.939
God perhaps the reason the creator couldn't find a worthy survivor

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.140
Is that those wooden people were just a bad idea to begin with. this failed creation was the fault of the creator himself not

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.560
Misbehaving humans. there's something humble about this myth. god messes up, owns up, and tries again

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.080
You know that old pithy saying- if at first you don't succeed

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.259
Wash the entire race of people away in the divine deluge and try again our last a flood story is an aztec tale

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:48.550
from Oaxaca in Mexico

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.349
And probably predates

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:57.688
Columbus. In this myth a god called the old one tells one chosen man to Abandon his chores because the world

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.959
Is going to be destroyed. the old one tells the man to plant a cedar tree because as we all know gods don't garden and to

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.030
find himself a carpenter who can make a canoe. the man does as he's told and miraculously a

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.789
giant Cedar Tree grows in A

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:19.169
Single night and the man finds a carpenter to build a canoe. the carpenter does fine work, by the way, just not so fine that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.449
He gets to survive what's about to go down

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.889
You know what happens next the rain comes and the Earth is destroyed

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:32.158
but the canoe floats on top of the waters and the man and his family are spared. the rain stops, the Earth dries up, and

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.279
The man comes out of his canoe and catches some fish to eat

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.479
But then the old one tells the man that he must not make a fire. soon the old one smelled something from the Earth

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:48.209
he come down and he finds the man cooking the fish on a fire the

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.990
Nerve the old one says who gave you permission to catch fish, and you were told not to make a fire yet

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.680
You are doing it. I told you not to make fire. You fool now

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.959
You will have to serve as an example for the new people and the old one hits him over the head

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.370
Because you did not listen

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.959
I am going to change you into a howler monkey. in another version of this myth

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:15.479
The man survives with a dog and the dog is the one that cooks for him eventually he discovers that the dog is

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:21.329
actually a woman and they marry and then they create a new race of humans because

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:27.989
Mythology. no matter which version were talking about though we have to wonder why the man who survived was chosen.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.449
I mean yeah, he can plant a cedar seed

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:36.568
But there must have been better option. these myths are fascinating for a number of reasons on a number of fronts notice the monkey

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.229
Transformation theme

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:45.028
Coincidence? maybe not even though the Mayan Empire and the Aztec empire didn't exist at the same time they were pretty close

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.940
Geographically and probably shared some stories

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:53.848
They also probably both hung out with monkeys when we compared these flood stories to the ones in Gilgamesh, or the bible there are

00:06:54.099 --> 00:07:00.449
Interesting similarities and differences. after all the old one picks out a special individual to be the sole survivor of his

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.119
Watery reset button

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:06.199
but Noah and Utanapishtim were chosen because of their unfailing

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:12.229
loyalty and Faith the Survivor of the Old ones flood in pretty much every version is characterized by

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:19.849
disobedience it makes one wonder about each cultures respective valuation of loyalty versus independence and whether that aztec

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:25.819
Survivor was meant as a disobedient role model or a fish cooking cautionary tale

00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:32.058
No matter where they come from though flood myths seem to be mainly about punishing humanity for Transgression

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:36.049
That's usually wickedness, but sometimes as in Yu the engineer's story

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:43.370
It's the poor management of the state by the king. these stories tell people that when bad things like floods happen they happen because

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:48.288
Well, we deserve them. they also remind us that humanity is imperfect

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:53.089
But the gods who created us are as well- again and again the gods in these stories

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:59.179
Feel like they've made a mistake in creating mankind and they want to just start over. no matter how hard they try

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:04.039
Humans just kind of keep screwing up even when a God tries to get it right and to start from scratch

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.968
They can't or maybe we can't because after all

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.139
Guess we're only human

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:12.139
