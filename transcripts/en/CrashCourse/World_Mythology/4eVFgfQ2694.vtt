00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology, and today, we're going to talk about a small, easy topic:

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.360
The creation of the Universe.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.120
This is the first of several episodes on creation stories,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.520
and this one will center on myths that imagine a universe created out of nothing.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.020
Or possibly something.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.500
Sometimes out of water–

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.980
Probably water, but it's magical water.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.800
It's primordial water.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.260
Hey Thot, do Egyptian gods drink water?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.140
[Intro Music]

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.320
Myths that describe creation as coming out of nothing are some of the hardest to get our heads around.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.080
In Latin, the phrase "ex nihilo" is used to describe this type of creation,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.400
and it can cause a bit of existential dread for people who are uncomfortable

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.660
with the idea of absolute nothing.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.600
No time, no space, just an infinite void.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.180
Like when the Wi-Fi suddenly goes down.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.120
But just, much, much worse.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.120
Just ask Hephaestus, Greek god of technology.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.240
That guy knows about unstable rooter architecture.
And hammers.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.520
The ex nihilo creation story that's probably the best known in the West comes from the Book of Genesis.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.860
In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. And the Earth was without form, and void;

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.320
and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.560
So, in this story, the main character is God.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.560
And hey, let's take just a quick minute to remember that this is mythology not religious studies,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.220
so we're gonna be refering to the judeo-christian God as a character.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.200
So take a second, to just get confortable with that...
And now let's move on.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.600
So, this character exists before anything we would call "the world."

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.260
Where does God exist? It's unclear. 
There's a void, there's water,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.320
which are handy if God needs storage space or is thirsty but... that's about it.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.040
Ex nihilo creation stories are common in the ancient Near East,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.340
the Mediterranean world where the Abrahamic religions–Judaism, Christianity, and Islam–originated.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.140
Egypt was part of an interconnected Mediterranean system, and one of its creation myths

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.800
also posits a universe coming from nothing, as we can see in this fragment.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.360
"I am the eternal spirit, I am the sun that rose from the primeval waters.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.920
My soul is God, I am the creator of the word. Evil is my abomination, I see it not.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.060
I am the creator of the order wherein I live, I am the word, which will never be annihilated

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.640
in this my name of "soul."

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.500
Take away the first person pronoun and the bold claims, and you can see the similarities to the Genesis story.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.680
There is an eternal God who creates the world, and then there are waters out of which rise...

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.540
well, in this case it's the sun, which is nice.
Just ask Ra, Egyptian sun god.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.960
Cause eventually humans would realize that some of us look better with a tan, me especially.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.440
I don't know about you, but I have a hard time conceiving of nothingness.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.800
I'm a lot more accustomed to... "thingness".

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.880
I mean isn't nothingness... a thing, in and of itself?

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.620
And hey even more importantly, can we really call it "nothingness" with all this water around?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:12.460
Fortunately for people like me, there's a word to describe the condition before creation: Chaos.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.540
Which mythologist David Leeming defines as "the primal void or state of uniform nondifferenciation

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.280
that precedes the creation of the world in most creation myths."

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.680
Chaos is something of a background in many of these myths.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.280
As it is in the Greek version of creation found in The Theogony by Hesiod, a poet and sheep farmer,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.240
who probably lived in the 8th century BCE.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.620
According to this version, "Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Earth."

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.780
Not much to go on there, but as we can see,

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.780
Chaos is what we have before a deity or deities roll up, and provide order.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.560
And also the Earth apparently has breasts.
Mother Earth, I guess? Makes sense.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.100
In many myths, an augural way to put things in order is to bring light out of darkness.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.400
In one creation myths from the Kono people of Guinea,

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.200
the darkness before creation is inhabited by Death, his wife and his daughter.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.320
In the beginning, there was darkness.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.440
And in it lived Death called Sa with his wife and daughter.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.540
The three of them were all that was.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.100
There was nowhere for them to live comfortably, so Sa started it.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.280
He used magic power and he made an endless mud sea.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.520
In this mud place Sa built his house.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.040
After that the god Alatangana came to visit Sa.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:37.140
He found Sa's house dirty and dark. Alatangana thought Sa should do better than that and he said so.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.120
"Nothing can live in such a place," the god told Sa.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.940
"This house needs fixing up, everything is too dark."

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.180
So Alatangana thought he'd better take things in hand.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.120
He made the mud solid– we now know it as Earth.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.540
"The Earth feels sad," God said. "I will make plants and animals to live on it." So he did.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.780
And that... is how we got Home Renovation–just kidding, I love this myth.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.580
I love that God thinks that the earth is sad and so he gets the earth a puppy to cheer it up.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.620
A puppy, and some plants.
You know, spruce up the joint.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.940
But notice that there are a lot of similarities between this myth and the Egyptian myth.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.240
In that both describe a vast sea.
One of mud, one of water,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.980
and that there is a god who exist previous to, and outside of the void, and the darkness.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:31.560
Though the Kono myth differs, and that implies that Death is the one constant in the universe.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.000
Oh no! And now i'm worried about the puppy.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.580
But, why all this talk about water?

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.200
Well, we don't know exactly, but if you're living in an ancient society,

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.400
and you try to think through something as big as the creation of the universe,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.560
you probably turn your thoughts to the vastest thing you were aware of:

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.660
the sky, and the sea.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.500
Even if you only experience the ocean from the relative safety of the shore,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.160
there is something unknowable and eternal about it,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.760
that makes it possible to imagine the sea existing for all time. And even before time itself.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.660
And according to theories of evolution, the idea that all life came from the sea is fairly accurate.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.860
But let's not get into evolution here, we'll leave that to Hank and the scientists over at Crash Course Biology.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.900
Hey fun fact, though: the western hemisphere has water too.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.980
And we have some ex nihilo creation stories of our own

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.880
One of the most difficult and fascinating comes from the Maya of Guatemala,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.720
and is recorded in the Popul Vuh, or "the book of the community."

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.620
It's not as catchy in translation.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.420
In this complex story, creation occurs four times.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.940
But it begins, like the Gospel of John in the New Testament, with the Word.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.140
And just because I think it's going to be fun to watch Thought Bubble animate nothingness,

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.720
let's see this myth there.

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.860
Hey, Thoth. Pass the popcorn.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.720
The world began long ago in a place called Quiché, where the Quiché people lived.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.800
There no one, at first. There was not one animal yet.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.860
And no bird fish or tree.
There was no rock, or forest, no canyon, no meadow.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.360
There was Sky, separated from all things.
The face of the Earth was invisible.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.500
There was nothing that could make a sound.
There was the sea, so calm and all alone.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.420
There was dark, and night, and sea murmurings, ripplings.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:21.880
Yet within the dark, and night, and sea, there was the maker, and there was the feathered serpent.

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.900
And they brought their words together.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.980
Joined them with their thoughts.
Planned creation.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:33.080
Their words and thoughts were so clear, that whatever they said, came to be.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.980
And the serpent and the maker thought about the nature of the world.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.260
What would be light and dark, who would bring food, and what everything should look like.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.920
And then by speaking their thoughts, they brought the world into existence.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.280
Starting with Earth, and then moving on to its features like mountains, and trees.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.960
Followed by wild animals.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.340
But there was a problem:

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.860
the wild animals were unable to speak the names of the maker and a feathered serpent.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:01.300
As well as the other gods who helped bring about creation. And they were unable to praise the gods.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.300
Thus the first creation was a failure.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.900
The maker had to start over again,

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.400
but not before explaining to all the wild animals their lot was to be brought low.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.920
Which, considering the fact that the maker and the feathered serpent organized things this way,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.660
seems at least a little unfair.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.160
You–bird, deer, you will stay where you are,

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.660
where you sleep and eat, in the forest and canyons, among the tree and bush.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.360
You will be eaten, you will kill and be killed.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.400
You will stay low and serve, since you cannot talk and praise your god.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.180
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:35.680
This particular myth is fascinating for a number of reasons.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:39.880
First of all, it reminds me of the story in Genesis, of Adam giving names to all the animals,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.600
and establishing humanity's dominion over all non-speaking creatures,

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:50.300
providing a single reason why humans should be considered special among all animals:

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:56.360
we have the power of speech, and by extension, the power to invent and tell creation stories of our own.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.000
Just ask Anansi, African spider god of stories–
Thot, don't eat him. This is not Australia.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.360
Even though this myth doesn't focus on Chaos, or the void or nothingness,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:11.520
it does have the idea that before creation, there was nothing. Except God, or the Word.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:16.300
And like the creation myths we looked at earlier, it include an endless sea.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.940
A physical manifestation of things unknown.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:25.680
But also of the source of life, since nothing we can see exist without water.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.240
Especially people, but especially fish.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.320
We'll spend a little more time in the cosmic ocean in our next episode,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.500
when we look at eggs, seeds, and Earth-divers.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.980
But this creation story is elaborate.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.640
Since creation 1.0 doesn't go so well, the maker and the feathered serpent get back to work,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:47.860
and they have to get all the way to creation 4.0 before they resolve all of the major glitches.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:52.660
And even then they're probably still some software updates  like ancient, ancient software

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.140
like service packs but for existence.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:10:02.400
Before we leave the realm of ex nihilo creation, I want to give one more example: the Big Bang.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.400
And a lot of you are now staring at your screens in confusion and horror,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.320
and saying that this isn't a myth at all.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:15.600
But remember, we're talking about significant stories, with staying power which the Big Bang certainly is.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.920
So, let's try it out.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.540
Hank and Phil Plait have gone over this in detail, over at Crash Course Astronomy,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.580
and we've talked about it on Big History.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.300
Here, we're going to use the version related by Brian Swimme in his book The Universe is a Green Dragon

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.860
"Imagine that furnace out of which everything came forth. This was a fire that filled the Universe–

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.760
that was the Universe. There was no place in the Universe free from it.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.200
Every point of the cosmos was a point of this explosion of light.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:50.020
And all the particles of the Universe churned in extremes of heat and pressure,

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:58.080
all that we see about us all that now exists was there at the beginning in that great burning explosion of light."

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.420
Hey, that sounds a lot like some of the most ancient myths doesn't it?

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.740
"Like all ex nihilo creation stories the Big Bang start in a time before time

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.680
and gives us an origin event, one that seems to conjure light from darkness, heat from cold."

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:16.180
And OK, unlike earlier myths it doesn't supply a god, or water,

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:19.120
but you can still appreciate the structural similarities.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.500
And what's so great about fish anyway?
Oh! Sorry Thoth.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.420
So, yes. Ex nihilo creation myths are unsettling.

00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:31.280
They ask us to imagine void. Absence. Chaos.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.360
But then we see how each tradition brings some order to that.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.620
Order and light.
And sometimes mud.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:41.760
Thanks for watching. 
See you next week!

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.000
