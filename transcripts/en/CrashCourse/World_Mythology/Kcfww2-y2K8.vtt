Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today we’re talking about

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.030
a hero myth from Africa. It’s got everything
– water serpents, a brag

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.630
aby, banana beer, a murder scepter, and the
worst dad in the world. Even worse than Saturn

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:23.000
– who ate his children! Join Thoth and I
for a look at the Epic of Mwindo.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.539
[Intro]
The Mwindo story comes from the Nyanga people

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.050
of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Like
all myths, the story has changed from telling

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.680
to telling. But in every version, Mwindo rises
from an auspicious birth to become chief of

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.890
his people, facing danger and defeating villains
along the way. The version we’ll discuss

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.190
comes from a storyteller of the oral tradition:
Candi Rureke.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.100
Before we get too far, a quick note on our
favorite meta-topic: pronunciation. I briefly

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.410
wanna confront not only … the difficulty
I’m gonna have nailing some of these pronunciations,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.770
but what might be indicated by the relative
absence, on the internet at least, of pronunciation

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.040
guides for stories from this part of the world.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.219
We asked you, our audience, to help with pronunciation
for this episode, and others yet to come.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:21.869
It was A HUGE HELP, but still if I say something
that sounds wrong, please write a comment,

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.859
but also go to forvo.com and record the correct
pronunciation so it’s out there in the world

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:29.859
for everyone!

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:35.250
Ok - enough talk-talk … on with the show.
Mwindo’s story begins before he’s even

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.139
born. His father, Shemwindo, the chief of
Tubondo has seven wives and swears that he

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:48.780
will kill any woman who bears him a son. He
wants daughters who will bring dowry money.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.909
This is bad news for Mwindo’s mom – because
he’s a boy!

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.549
But, luckily they have some help, since Nyanga
children receive guidance and protection from

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:04.109
their aunts, and Mwindo’s Aunt Iyangura
is pretty rad. Iyangura isn’t only strong,

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.229
beautiful, and clever, she’s also married
to Mukiti, the water serpent, who also has

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.930
special influence over bats and spiders.
You might remember the tale of baby Hermes,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.760
who could walk and talk and make mischief
the moment he was born. Well, Mwindo one ups

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.170
him. He helps his mother collect firewood
and food... while he’s still in the womb!

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.319
He’s born by leaping out of his mother’s
middle, making all the midwives and obstetricians

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:36.340
yell: “What kind of child is that?”[1]
Mwindo is born holding an axe, a magical bag,

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.060
a magic rope and most importantly: a magic
conga scepter–it’s kind of like a fly-swatter–made

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.560
of an antelope tail.
Shemwindo isn’t happy that Mwindo is a boy.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.590
First he goes to Mwindo’s house and throws
spear after spear into the walls, trying to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.090
kill his only son. When Mwindo emerges unscathed,
Shemwindo grabs him and buries him alive.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.530
But Mwindo, who can speak even though he’s
a baby, curses his father the whole way down,

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.249
and then just claws his way out of the grave.
Finally, Shemwindo grabs Mwindo and sews him

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:20.640
up into a drum which he throws into a lake!
The sky rumbles and it rains for seven days,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.530
and the whole village suffers a famine. Methinks
this does not bode well for Shemwindo.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.560
Sitting underwater, still sewn into a drum,
and definitely not drowning, Mwindo decides

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.680
it’s time to beat a hasty retreat. He starts
to roll the drum up the river to find aunt

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.329
Iyangura (remember, she lives with the water
serpent). Along the way, he defeats a bunch

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.860
of water creatures by singing to them, and
spends his time boasting, calling himself

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.079
“Little one Just Born He Walked.” When
he reaches his aunt, she slices him out of

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.029
the drum.
Iyangura serves many roles in Mwindo’s story.

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.120
She’s a strong mother figure, and advice
giving goddess, a role you’ll remember from

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.109
Joseph Campbell’s theory of the hero’s
journey featured in episode twenty-five. Iyangura

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.569
also sets Mwindo on his quest. She tells him
that even though Shemwindo is the worst dad

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:15.920
in the world, Mwindo can’t get revenge on
his own. “The lonely path is never a pleasant

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.390
one to travel,” she tells him.[2] That’s
why I’m glad we’re in this together, Thoth.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.961
Huh? Oh - yeah, also you guys are cool!
Mwindo listens to Iyangura, but can’t help

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:32.740
himself from messing with his dad. So he begins
singing a long, magical song that calls all

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.090
his father’s possessions in Tubondo to come,
and be his.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.490
Mwindo might have felt clever for stealing
his dad’s stuff, but it doesn’t work out

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.060
that well because Mwindo’s followers are
gluttons, who gorge themselves on newly arrived

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.340
food and get sick.. Mwindo can’t believe
this – he’s about to lead all these greedy

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.479
guts into battle – so he calls on Nkuba,
the god of lightning, to help him.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.479
Nkuba destroys Tubondo with seven lightning
flashes, turning the village and its residents

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.280
to dust, which is maybe a bit drastic. But,
Shemwindo finally gets the message: messing

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.860
with Mwindo is a bad idea. He flees to an
underground lair.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.990
But Mwindo doesn’t let his dad get away
that easy. First, he brings all of his uncles

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.430
who died in Tubondo back to life and commands
them to forge him baby-armor. Mwindo sets

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.940
out... and follows his father’s trail to
the underworld. We’re gonna follow with

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.060
him in the Thoughtbubble.
Underground, Mwindo meets Kahindo. She’s

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.879
a goddess of good fortune, but her dad is
Muisa, god of the underworld. Kahindo tells

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:47.490
Mwindo that Muisa is protecting Shemwindo.
But luckily, she hates her dad so much...

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.729
she agrees to tell Mwindo–step by step–what
he has to do defeat Muisa, and find his pops.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.639
First, she says, my dad’s gonna offer you
banana beer, but don’t drink that banana

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.949
beer, because it’s actually pee. Gross.
Second, my dad’s gonna offer you banana

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.979
paste, but don’t eat that banana paste,
because it’s actually poo. Even grosser.

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.530
Then, after you don’t eat his snacks, he’ll
ask you to pass his tests...and at that point,

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.900
you’re on your own.
Mwindo tracks down Muisa, and it’s exactly

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.650
as Kahindo said, and Muisa gives him a test:
cultivate a new, actual banana grove in the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:30.009
underworld. Mwindo uses a magic billhook that
tills the field and plants the seeds and harvests

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.780
the bananas all by itself.
Muisa unwinds his magical cowrie belt and

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:41.909
gives it an order: fly and kill Mwindo. The
belt zips off, finds Mwindo and kills him.

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.040
End of story, thanks for watching. MIKE TAKES
OUT HIS PHONE Thanks Thought Bubble. Usual

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:54.419
for lunch, Thoth? Shrimp? Crab cakes?
Just kidding. Back to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:00.349
As soon as Mwindo falls, his magic scepter
brings him back to life. I told you that thing

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:05.860
was important. Mwindo grabs the scepter and
sends it to go kill Muisa. The scepter flies

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.750
to Muisa and kills the god of the underworld!
And then...brings him back to life. That magical

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.379
autonomous murder-and-rebirth scepter REALLY
has a mind of its own.

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:21.189
Thanks for real Thoughtbubble. After the Battle
of Enchanted Accessories™, Mwindo completes

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:25.389
more of Muisa’s tests, Muisa makes some
more assassination attempts.

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:29.319
Eventually, Mwindo gets fed up with all the
testing and belt attacking and confronts Muisa

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:37.220
directly. “Give me my dad. I know you’re
hiding him.” Muisa refuses, and Mwindo kills

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.860
him once and for all, and keeps tracking.
Shemwindo’s tracks eventually end in the

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:48.190
home of Sheburu-wngu – the god of all creation.
Mwindo demands to know where his dad is, but

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:54.879
Sheburungu says that if Mwindo wants his help,
he’ll have to best him in a game of wiki.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.289
In this game, the players take turns editing
the entries for celebrities to include funny

00:07:59.289 --> 00:08:03.730
false details and the edit that lasts the
longest...OK JUST KIDDING BUT I KINDA HAD

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:06.129
TO RIGHT?
Seriously tho, in this case, a game of “wiki”

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:11.550
means guessing the number of black seeds held
in your opponent's hand. Mwindo agrees, and

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.909
the baby and the god start to play.
At first, Sheburungu beats Mwindo over and

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:23.780
over again, winning everything Mwindo owns
except his magic scepter. With his back to

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:30.659
the wall, Mwindo bets his scepter and begins
to win. Wager after wager, guess after guess,

00:08:30.659 --> 00:08:37.450
Mwindo cleans Sheburungu’s clock until he
wins all of Sheburungu's possessions. Including,

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.970
probably, his newly cleaned clock.
But Mwindo tells Sheburungu: I don’t want

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:48.400
your things, I don’t want creation, I just
want you to hand over my dad. Sheburungu has

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.960
to agree, and so Mwindo returns to Tubondo
with a captured Shemwindo. This is Mwindo’s

00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.520
turning point, when the boastful baby gets
the chance to face his father. Instead of

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:07.010
killing him, Mwindo is magnanimous, and pardons
Shemwindo for his past mistakes.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:12.420
Flush with mercy, he even brings Muisa back
to life - who offers his daughter Kahindo’s

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:18.270
hand in marriage. Mwindo refuses, saying he
wants to marry in Tubondo. This is going to

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:24.860
be a little tough, since Nkuba lightning zapped
everyone in Tubondo. So Mwindo revives them

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:30.640
too, bringing the whole village back to life.
Finally, Shemwindo admits to the village that

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.490
he was wrong to try to kill Mwindo and that
he’s sorry about that whole drowning in

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.790
a drum thing: “So may the male offspring
be spared,” he said, “for he has shown

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:47.390
me the way in which the sky becomes daylight
and has given me the joy of witnessing again

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:53.140
the warmth of the people and of all the things
here in Tubondo.” Mwindo replies: “I will

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:58.060
not hold a grudge against my father … What
my father did against me and what I did against

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.410
my father, all that is already over.”
Mwindo’s story doesn’t end here, though

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:07.440
– in his subsequent adventures he learns,
often the hard way, how to be a compassionate,

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.700
and respectful ruler. Mwindo thus returns
to his people, wiser and fit to rule. He pronounces

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:17.770
a blessing that establishes rules by which
to live:

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:23.100
May you grow many foods and many crops
May you live in good houses

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:27.880
May you moreover live in a beautiful village.
Don’t quarrel with one another.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.830
Don’t pursue another’s space
Don’t mock the invalid passing in the village.

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:38.110
And he who seduces another’s wife will be
killed

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.360
Accept the chief. Fear him. May he also fear
you.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:48.690
May you agree with one another, all together,
No enmity in the land nor too much hate.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:52.160
May you bring forth tall and short children
–

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.750
In so doing you will bring them forth for
the chief.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:11:01.450
So Mwindo has really grown up. His hero’s
journey took him from braggy baby to a just

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:06.440
ruler, fairly governing his people.
At its heart, the Mwindo story is a Freudian-style

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.210
conflict of a boy maturing to take his father’s
place. Take out the magical murder scepter

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:15.910
and the other supernatural parts and maybe
some of the more draconian rules, and it’s

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:21.000
also a model for an individual’s journey
from boastful child to wise ruler. And it

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.420
teaches us why we should never ever take banana
paste from a stranger.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.710
Mwindo shows us how an individual must mature
to become truly heroic, and also fulfills

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:35.810
an etiological role for the Nyanga people:
he re-establishes their village. He provides

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:41.840
the model of forgiveness and shows how a chief
must be powerful and also favored by the gods.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.590
He demonstrates that even with auspicious
beginnings and divine help, heroes are flawed

00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:58.500
and only achieve success if they learn and
grow. Thanks for watching. See you next time.
