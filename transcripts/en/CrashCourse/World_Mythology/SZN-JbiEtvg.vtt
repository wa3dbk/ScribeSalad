00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.110
Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today we’re following up our

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.230
spelunking episode with some rock-climbing.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.230
[[[Thoth in climbing gear?]]]

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.650
That’s right, today we’re taking on mountains
of myth.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.330
Big mountains, small mountains, holy mountains,
volcanic mountains.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.330
Thoth!

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.280
You got your crampons … on?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.240
Excelsior!

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.609
[Intro]
In myth, mountains are mysterious, dangerous,

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.769
and often have cool stuff inside them.

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.579
Because they reach towards the sky, they often
host the homes of gods.

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.640
Mount Olympus is probably the best known mountain
that’s both home to a pantheon and also

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.790
a real place where you can go eat grape leaves
and drink ouzo.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.200
And – even without all that Greek grog –Mountains
are perilous, as anyone who has ever spent

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.809
time climbing them knows, and this makes them
a good spot for hero myths.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.290
Mountains are often the homes of monsters,
the sites of avalanches, basically a big ole

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.399
heap of challenge.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.680
If you’re wondering now why anyone would
ever go there, well, you can’t forget that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.750
mountains also contain valuable minerals.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.819
And in myths, that means that they’re the
site of great treasure, especially gold.

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.079
Today we’re gonna look at two myths: one
from China and one from Japan.

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.549
In the first story, we’ll encounter a mountain
full of treasures, though most of those treasures

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.420
are a lot more utilitarian than gold.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.229
We’re also gonna look at a mountain that’s
a treasure itself, in that it has a god associated

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:30.229
with it.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.719
A very competitive god.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:36.229
A perfect example of a mountain stuffed with
treasure comes from China where people tell

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.520
the story of Ko-li and the Ten Thousand Treasure
Mountain.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.719
It’s a story of magic artifacts and a treacherous
king.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.279
But in the end, both K’o-li and his mother
demonstrate self-sacrifice and hard work.

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:52.669
K’o-li and his mother live in a valley among
the high mountains.

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:58.319
They’re too poor to have rice or corn, so
they survive by eating roots that K’o-li

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:59.319
digs up.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.319
One day, he’s only able to dig up enough
food for one person.

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.130
He gives the roots to his mother, saying he
isn’t hungry.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.939
But his mother refuses, saying she can’t
take the food while K’o-li wastes away.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.739
Just then, an old man with a long white beard
appears at the door.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.739
They give their food to this “Old Father”
and after he eats, K’o-li picks him up and

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.620
carries him back to his home in the mountains.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.300
When they arrive at the Old Man’s home,
they’re greeted by his beautiful daughter.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.380
In gratitude, the old man asks her to give
K’o-li her earrings as a reward for his

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.489
virtue.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:38.760
As it turns out, these earrings are also keys
to the Ten Thousand Treasure Mountain.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.989
One is made of gold and it opens the secret
door.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.989
The other is silver and it allows you to leave.

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.090
K’o-li takes the earrings and unlocks to
the door to the treasure trove.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.440
Inside, the mountain is filled with incredible
treasures: gold, silver, pearls.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.780
But K’o-li is both humble and practical.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.629
He chooses a simple white stone grinder so
that he’ll be able to earn a living grinding

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.629
grain.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.829
He lets himself out with the silver earring,
and brings the grinder home to his mother.

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.450
As soon as K’o-li tries to use the grinder,
he discovers that instead of grinding grains,

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.920
it actually produces corn.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.560
K’o-li and his mother can’t believe their
luck, and they take the magical corn to share

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.019
with the rest of their village.

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.330
Eventually, news of this magical corn-producing-grinder
reaches the king.

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.319
He orders that an official should to travel
to the village and bring him this magic grinder.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.019
The official arrives, and demands the grinder,
but the second he touches it, it crumbles

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.870
into a pile of lime.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.760
The king is furious and has the official beheaded.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.830
Without the magic grinder, it isn’t long
before K’o-li and his mother are hungry

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.889
again.

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.109
K’o-li goes back to the Ten Thousand Treasure
Mountain, and uses the golden earring.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:04:00.310
This time, he chooses a yellow stone mortar
that magically produces white rice.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.680
He silver-earrings his way out, takes the
mortar home and before long… the king is

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.219
hearing stories about magical rice now!

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:09.250
He orders another official to get the mortar.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.779
The official arrives at the village, grabs
it, and wouldn’t you know – it turns to

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:13.799
lime.

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.299
Another official loses his head.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.880
Hungry again, K’o-li returns to the mountain.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.049
This time he chooses a hoe.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.000
At home, he pulls the hoe across the ground
and giant corn stalks grow.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.169
K’o-li shares his food with the villagers
and again, the king hears the news.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.050
This time, rather than seize the hoe, officials
seize K’o-li and bring him to the king.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.050
Everyone gets to keep their head this time.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.460
The king demands to know: where are you getting
these wonderful treasures?

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.870
K’o-li tells the greedy king about the Ten
Thousand Treasure mountain: “I open the

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.370
door in the mountain with this gold earring
and…”

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.000
But then and there – the king snatches the
gold earring and sets off immediately.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.870
The king rides as fast as he can to the mountain
and gets inside.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.150
As the gold key grants his access, his eyes
fill with visions of treasure.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.800
But behind him, the door to the mountain closes
-- with K’o-li and the freedom-granting

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.130
silver earring … outside.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.110
Now you might think K’o-li would be worried
about the king trapped in the mountain, where

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.510
he’ll probably starve to death or asphyxiate
or get crushed by all that treasure.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.850
But K’o-li has more pressing concerns: He’s
lost one of the girl’s earrings!

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.009
His mother bundles up two bushels of corn
and takes it the old man’s home to apologize.

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.310
But when she arrives, Old Father tells her
“we don’t need your corn!

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.199
Use it to feed your village.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.870
I’ve decided, your son is so honest and
hard-working, he and my daughter should be

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:40.870
married.”

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.770
Which is to say - the generous, hard-working
K’o-li lived happily ever after, while the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.050
greedy king perished underground, surrounded
by useless riches.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.910
But… were they EVEN RICHES?

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.310
THINKY FACE…

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.129
EMOJI
The Ten Thousand Treasure Mountain represents

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:03.820
an important opportunity, and location, for
our main character.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.169
But some mountains are the main characters
themselves.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:13.340
Even today, Japan has a complex religious
landscape: a mix of the ancient religion Shintoism,

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.780
the 6th-century addition of Buddhism and more
recently a dash of Christianity.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.469
According to Leonard &amp; McClure, “Shinto
views all landforms – indeed all things

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.069
– as being closely associated with a particular
kami.”

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:32.419
A kami is a kind of god, and mountains, trees,
stones, lakes, even grains ... have their

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:33.770
own kami.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:38.449
When Buddhism arrived in Japan in the 6th
century BCE, it needed to assimilate to the

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:44.250
pre-existing animistic religion and the result
was a syncretic combination of Buddhist figures

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.650
and styles of worship with Shinto shrines
and gods.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.939
One way to see this relationship is to look
at one myth involving two famous mountains

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:54.319
and the Buddha Amida.

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:59.439
The story starts long ago, with an argument
between Mt. Yatsu-ga-take and Mt. Fuji.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.360
Both mountains are animated by their own kami.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.949
One day, Yatsu-ga-take and Fuji begin to argue
about which one of them is taller.

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:13.419
No matter how they debate, they can’t reach
an answer, so they ask Buddha Amida to be

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:14.419
the judge.

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:18.360
Amida runs a pipe between the tops of the
two mountains and pours water in it to see

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.330
which way it will flow.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:25.539
The water flows downward toward Fuji – Yatsu-ga-take
is taller!

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:30.259
When Amida announces the results, Fuji is
furious.

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:35.169
She attacks Yatsu-ga-take with a stick, smashing
great gaps into his top.

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:38.790
That’s why Yatsu-ga-take has eight peaks.

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:43.400
Many mountains are revered in Japanese culture,
but none more so than Mt. Fuji.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.860
(It’s always a good idea to revere a mountain
that might rough you up.)

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:52.450
But Mt. Fuji and Asama no Okami, the kami
associated with her, aren’t always depicted

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.450
so aggressively.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:57.789
For instance, there was once a boy named Yosoji
who lives near Mt. Fuji.

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:04.460
Yosoji’s mother has smallpox and is dying,
so he asks the magician Kamo Yamakiko for

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:05.460
help.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:10.710
Kamo Yamakiko tells Yosoji: if he wants to
save his mother, he must fetch water from

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.919
the source of a small stream near the southwest
side of Mt. Fuji.

00:08:14.919 --> 00:08:19.980
Yosoji sets out but is confounded when the
path branches into three paths.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:25.020
Suddenly a beautiful girl dressed in white
steps out of the forest and leads him down

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.409
the correct path to the stream.

00:08:27.409 --> 00:08:32.510
And in that stream, some Thoughtbubbles:
When Yosoji arrives at the stream, the girl

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.710
tells him to drink, and then gather water
for his mother.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:41.470
Then she leads Yosoji back to the crossroads
and tells him to meet her there again in three

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.230
days, because he’s going to need more of
the magical water.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:46.760
Yosoji does as he’s told.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.070
He takes the water back to his home, and gives
it to his mother to drink, along with many

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:52.580
other sick villagers.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.600
When he runs out of water, he returns to meet
the mysterious girl.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.980
He does this again and again.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:04.410
After five trips, his mother and the rest
of the sick villagers are cured.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:10.540
The villagers praise him, but Yosoji knows
that he owes it all to the beautiful girl,

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:11.600
so he goes to thank her.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.400
When Yosoji arrives, the stream has dried
up.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:21.620
He’s surprised and sad; he prays for the
girl to appear so he can thank her properly.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.530
When he rises from prayer, poof, there she
is.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.460
Yosoji thanks her and begs the girl to reveal
her name, because y’know... “beautiful

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.100
girl from the magical stream” is a pretty
weird thing to call someone.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.370
But she won’t tell him.

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:42.570
Instead, she swings a branch of camellia in
the air and a cloud flies down from Mt. Fuji,

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.710
enveloping her and carrying her back to the
sacred mountain.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:53.290
That … is when Yosoji realizes the girl
is actually the goddess of Mt. Fuji, moonlighting

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:55.250
as a stream kami.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.820
Right then and there, his heart fills with
love for her.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.250
He kneels down before the retreating goddess
and she tosses the camellia branch to him...

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.220
a symbol of their connection.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.840
Thanks, Thoughtbubble, that was some “peak”
mythology!

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:14.040
And very touching, showing us the more generous
side of mountains.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:19.590
See, it’s not all rocks and suffocation;
mountains are also a place of pure, life-giving

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:20.590
water.

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.320
They’re as varied as any pantheon we’ve
encountered!

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.800
Though… seemingly less incestous.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.400
Probably a good thing.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.330
Today we’ve seen rich mountains, competitive
mountains, angry mountains, and finally a

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.310
loving and generous mountain.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.990
We’ve also realized that while gods are
often represented as people and animals (and

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.260
people-animal hybrids)... elements of the
natural world, like mountains in all their

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.490
mile-high power and grandeur, can represent
gods, too.

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:46.370
Gods you can climb.

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.940
Is there nothing we humans won’t anthropomorphize?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:49.940
Thanks for watching.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:11:34.870
And see you next time, when we’re gonna
make like some trees… and myth.
