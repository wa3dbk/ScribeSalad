00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.700
Hello!

00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.280
My name is Mike Rugnetta and this is Crash Course: Mythology.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.980
Mythology is a complicated subject.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.400
It touches on literature, history, anthropology, sociology, psychology, religion, and even science.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.060
Have you ever tried to make a Slurpee,

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.320
mixing all of the flavors together?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.560
Mythology is exactly like that,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.440
but it's a Slurpee of knowledge,

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.420
with no brain freeze and a lot to learn.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.180
So maybe, actually a tiny brain freeze.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.420
But a different kind of brain freeze.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.700
What I'm trying to say is that

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.420
don't be surprised if some of what you hear during the next forty or so episodes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.020
echoes some of the things you may have heard in other Crash Courses.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.000
And don't worry if what you hear in one episode

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.420
reminds you of what you've heard in another.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.480
We do that on purpose, and usually we know what we're doing.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.040
Right, Thoth, Egyptian god of knowledge with an awesome ibis head? Right.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.160
Do ibis-headed gods like bird seed?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.820
We have so much to learn ahead!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:59.840
[theme music]

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.900
There are a couple of reasons mythology is a more difficult subject than some of the others we've tackled.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.480
One is that many myths are very, very old,

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.660
and often exist in many versions.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.820
So just keep that in mind when we discuss a particular myth in the series.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.900
If you've heard the myth in a different form,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.540
it doesn't mean we've gotten it wrong,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.000
though that is always possible-- just ask Atë, the Greek goddess of folly.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.460
It just may be that we're working from a different version of the myth.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.880
We'll try to put references to the versions that we're using in the show notes.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.240
Sometimes we'll even be presenting composites of a number of different tellings of these myths.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.020
Another difficulty with mythology is that it's open to so many interpretations.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.200
Are myths records of historical fact? Deliberate fictions?

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.300
Ways of understanding otherwise incomprehensible events? Misunderstanding?

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.180
We... are not in a position to say.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.680
The kind of thing that scholars spend their entire lives arguing about.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.540
Along with the myths, we're gonna present possible interpretations, but let's be clear:

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.340
these are interpretations, not facts in the sense that their meanings can be confirmed by a weight of evidence.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.960
Mythology has been argued about and theorized for over a hundred years,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.540
and many myths can be read and understood in a number of ways.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.700
When presenting interpretations, we're gonna let you know that we're doing that

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.140
so that you don't think that we're presenting an interpretation as a fact...

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.900
because that will get us into arguments, and we would love to avoid those.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.320
This is also probably a good time to point out that in many instances, the line between myth and religion...

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.280
is blurry.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.080
And, as we're gonna explain in a minute, we're working with a definition of myth that focuses on story,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.360
rather than truth.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.960
When one views myths primarily as stories or as literary artifacts,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.440
it allows you to enjoy them and think about them apart from their value as structures of religious belief.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.560
So, when we recount stories from the Bible as myths,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.600
we're not definitively saying that they're either true or untrue,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.500
just that they're stories that people have used in a variety of ways over time.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.300
A third problem in discussing myth is that most myths don't have nameable authors,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.080
or even when they do, like Homer or Virgil,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.260
it turns out these guys were really just recasting older stories into new language.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.420
Most of the time, we don't know who originated myths, or how, or why,

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.520
but, luckily, for our purposes here, that actually doesn't matter much.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.480
But the last problem we have to talk about does matter.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.960
And that's the difficulty of finding a good, working definition for the word "myth."

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.840
This is tricky, especially given the way we use the word in contemporary English.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.900
Much of the time, when we say something is a "myth," what we mean is that it's not true.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.300
For example, the idea that you swallow eight spiders a year while you're sleeping-- it's not true. It's a myth.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.900
Not sure if this applies to Australians though;

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.140
I would wager that you guys swallow at least eight spiders a year.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.380
Everything I know about Australia I learned from the internet.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.580
Because we use the term "myth" to mean something that isn't true,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.500
we can come away with the definition of "myth" as a story that is false and not to be taken seriously.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.240
But myths have been taken seriously...

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:12.520
by scholars, sure, but more importantly, by generations and generations of people who've heard these stories,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.560
and found in them something worth telling again.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.920
Which is not to say people don't question their myths.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:25.120
Philosophers were writing about the absurdity of Greek myths as far back as the sixth century B.C.E.,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.040
probably even earlier.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.400
So, if a myth isn't just a story that someone made up, or a word that we use to label something as false,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.280
then what is it?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.720
Myth comes from the Greek word "mythos"--

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.860
which means "word" or, more significantly, "story."

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.440
That doesn't mean every myth, or even the most important ones are Greek,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.800
but those will probably be the ones most familiar with our to viewers in America and Europe.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.920
At least, until the new Rick Riordan series gets going.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.980
And honestly, if goddesses of love, Aphrodite and Freya, ever got into an arm wrestling competition,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.140
Aphrodite would TOTALLY dominate, because Freya cries golden tears, and Aphrodite kills people. BOOM.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.360
Sorry, I get sidetracked by Greek myths;

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.380
that's gonna happen a lot. Just ask Hermes, Greek god of roads.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.920
So, we're gonna start by saying that a myth is a story,

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.540
but it's a special kind of story, that for the purposes of this series, has two primary characteristics:

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.460
significance and staying power.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.380
This means that the subject matter is about something important,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.700
something about how the world works, or how the world itself got going...

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.280
how things came to be.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.580
And then there's staying power.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.260
These are stories that have survived centuries, sometimes millennia,

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.480
and this is a testament to the deep meaning or functional importance of these stories

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.720
to the people who hear and tell them.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.500
Now, if I know Crash Course fans, there are probably some people right now saying, "Mike,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.820
it sounds like you might lump in folktales, and maybe even fairy tales, with your myths."

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.840
I'm not gonna lie.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.000
There may be a folktale that creeps in from time to time,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.300
but we're gonna steer clear of fairy tales for the most part.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.400
For die hard folklorists-- and yes, that is a thing--

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.680
proper myths only deal with the creation of the world, or maybe the universe, and thus,

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.840
all real myths are religious... or quasi-religious.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.580
Mythology theorists who come at myths from a religious studies angle

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.100
tend to say that the main characters of myths must be gods...

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.760
but this leaves out hero stories, which I think are pretty important, and also,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.520
those are the ones with the sea monsters, so we're gonna include those too.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.540
There are also those myths that don't feature any supernatural elements at all--

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.160
what Professor Robert Segal calls "beliefs," or "credos."

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.220
Most Americans will be familiar with the "rags to riches" story of the American dream.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.740
Those stories are myths-- not because they aren't true

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:42.560
(sometimes poor people do become rich and successful in spite of tough upbringings,

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.060
and largely because of grit and hard work);

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.020
they're myths not because they have religious significance,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.720
they're mythic because of their staying power...

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.980
and the tenacity with which proponents of the myth take them to be true.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:01.000
Because these types of stories fit into our broad definition of a significant story

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800
where personalities are the lead characters,

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.820
we will be talking about them-- but only in a later episode.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:11.620
At this point, it might be a good idea to give an example of the kind of stories we'll be talking about in this series.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.140
And, to do so, I'm gonna go to Greece.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.220
YAY!! Greece!

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.220
Wine dark seas, delicious olives, beautiful ruins, anti-austerity protests,

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.360
and the setting for the story of Persephone.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.460
Take us there, Thought Bubble.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.700
Persephone was the daughter of the harvest goddess, Demeter, and supreme god, Zeus...

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:32.020
who were brother and sister (we'll get into all that weird incest stuff later)

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.540
and her original name was Kore, which can be translated as "girl."

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.860
One day, Kore was out picking flowers when she caught the eye of Zeus's brother, Hades,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.980
who rode up from the underworld (also confusingly called Hades)

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.620
and kidnapped her to make her his wife...

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.740
and also probably raped her,

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.160
but again, we're gonna save the deeply uncomfortable sexual content for another episode

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.300
except for this brief mention right here. Sorry.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.720
Kore was understandably... upset.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:01.120
Demeter was full on enraged, and threatened to make all mankind starve,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.260
so finally Zeus had to go and ask his brother to give Kore back.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.800
In some versions of this myth, this was a problem for Zeus,

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.760
because he had promised Kore to his brother as a wife without telling Demeter first.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:16.580
Hades was not a dumb guy, and before he let Kore go, he offered her a snack.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.000
Kore had been warned to never eat anything in the underworld,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.520
but she must've been extremely hungry by then,

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.680
and really, I mean, how much harm could six honey sweet pomegranate seeds really do?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.460
Well, turns out, a lot.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:32.180
In some versions, she eats them on purpose because she actually liked her husband.

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.020
In others, she's tricked into it.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.580
Either way, even six seeds matter.

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:43.360
Kore has to remain in the underworld for six months out of the one month for each seed that she ate,

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.620
and will spend the other six months on Olympus with her parents.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.100
During the six months in Olympus, Demeter would allow the fruits and grains to flourish.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.960
The rest of the time, Demeter would mourn Kore, who had renamed herself Persephone,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.080
and the ground would freeze, and nothing would grow...

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.880
and that is why we have winter.

00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:03.680
Thanks thought bubble!

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.400
So, this is a story that is significant because of its explanatory power.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:12.780
The fancy term for this is an "etiological narrative," or origin story.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.500
The Persephone myth explains the seasons,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.860
relating the cycle of planting and harvest

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.340
to the actions of the immortals.

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.900
For some mythologists, like E.B. Tylor, this story is an example of myth as primitive science.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.560
Tylor and many other scientists drew a distinction between primitive people,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:36.460
who used myths to explain the world in which they lived, and modern people, who use science for that purpose.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:39.900
For Tylor, myth and science can't really be reconciled;

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.300
science has taken the place of myth, so we don't need myths anymore.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.000
This is a pretty hard core theory, and since we like to view things complexly here at Crash Course,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.560
we're not gonna subscribe to it, or any theory wholeheartedly.

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:55.740
But we are gonna introduce some of these theories to you,

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.380
so that you can make up your own mind.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.380
Right now we're not gonna get too deep into the theory of myths--

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.620
mythography, if you wanna thrill your friends and impress people at parties,

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.700
because I want to tell you where the series is planning to go,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.040
but also because there are a lot of theories to mythology,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.080
and I don't want to include too many of them in this introduction.

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.580
As long time viewers know, it's easy to get lost in the weeds once we start talking about theory,

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.280
which is part of the reason we love theory so much.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.080
And it's one of the reasons we have eight Sanskrit deities who are guardians of the right direction.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:30.300
This series isn't going to be comprehensive.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:34.680
We can't present everything there is to know about thousand year old stories

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.620
in four hundred odd minutes of video.

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:39.500
But we are gonna try to introduce you to some myths you might not know,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.460
from places that you might be less familiar with.

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:47.340
This approach is gonna be comparative and thematic, rather than geographic.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.160
Here's what we're planning:

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.640
The first theme we'll be covering is the most difficult:

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:51.760
Creation myths.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.080
Most cultures have some story of how the world and the people in it came to be;

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.760
we're gonna spend a few weeks working through them.

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.500
Be forewarned, creation myths are often mysterious, the language can be tricky or obscure,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.200
so expect a bit of confusion and a lot of interpretation...

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.260
also some turtles for a significant distance in the downward direction.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.000
It's turtles all the way down.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.060
After we see how the world and, sometimes, the universe was created,

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.200
we're gonna examine pantheons:

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.820
the groups of gods that feature in stories from different cultures, and how they function in those cultures.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.780
And then we're gonna take a look at how the universe was destroyed--

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:30.440
looking at flood myths and the apocalypse.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.280
Now, obviously this puts us in the realm of religion

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.920
and the potential for challenging people's belief systems is high.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:42.900
Like we said earlier, we're gonna try to focus on the stories, and leave questions of truth and belief up to you.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:48.440
In the second half of the series, we'll come down from Olympus and Valhalla and all those various mountains;

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.200
we're gonna do about ten episodes on heroes from all over the world,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.800
which should be really fun, maybe even super.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.820
See what I did there?

00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.820
After heroes, we're gonna talk about mythical places and creatures and objects like winged sandals,

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.280
and we'll finish up with a few episodes on myths in the modern world,

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.800
which, for viewers of Crash Course Psychology and Literature, might sound a bit familiar.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:11.340
So, that is the broad outline of this series.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.880
We're really excited to be bringing this to you, really hope you enjoy it...

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.420
Will it become the stuff of legend?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.480
Just ask Balder, Norse god of joy.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.440
We'll see you next week.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.700
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad &amp; Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis, Indiana

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:29.800
and is produced with the help of all these nice people.

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.780
Our animation team is Thought Cafe.

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:36.180
