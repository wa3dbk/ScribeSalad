Hey there!

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.220
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse mythology
and today we continue our look at mythical

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.300
creatures with one of the most popular beasts
of all time: [[[Thoth stands up very straight.]]]

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.300
Dragons!

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.480
Aaaand also serpents – but mostly DRAGONS!

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.510
[[[Thoth slightly disappointed.]]]

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:21.369
Hide your thatched roofed cottages and get
ready for some burninating.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:28.960
Intro
To talk about dragons, we gotta start with

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:29.960
snakes.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.329
In myth, snakes often serve a function similar
to more terrifying creatures.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.260
They’re etymologically similar, too.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.579
In fact, the Latin word draco is used for
both dragons and snakes.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.040
In the Judeo Christian tradition, the most
important serpent is that apple-shilling,

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.289
well… snake... from the garden of Eden.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.929
Fun fact: he didn’t really start out as
a snake; he had legs until the Lord punished

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:55.480
him by making him slither on his belly.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.070
No more scampering for that guy.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.480
In the Babylonian stories of creation, we
learn about the enormous snake Tiamat, which

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.510
we’ve mentioned before.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.590
Across the Ancient Near East, we find a number
of snakes associated with goddesses: Ishtar

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.520
in Mesopotamia, Wadjet in Egypt, and even
Athena in Greece, when she wasn’t hanging

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.570
out with owls.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.020
Somewhere along the way snakes start sort
of morphing into dragons.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.020
Not…

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.020
literally.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.020
That would be dope tho.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.020
I mean in their stories.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.549
Babylon had guardian dragons called Mušḫuššu,
with a serpent’s head and body, the front

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.409
feet of a lion and a poisonous scorpion’s
tail.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.939
In Biblical Babylon, king Nebuchadnezzar kept
a dragon in the temple of the god Bel and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.710
suggested that Daniel, a noble youth of Jerusalem,
worship it.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.299
Daniel said that he preferred to worship the
Lord and that he could kill the dragon even

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.610
without a weapon.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:53.219
Daniel killed it by feeding it cakes of boiled
pitch, fat and hair, which made it explode.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:56.899
For this mess, the king threw Daniel into
the lion’s den.

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.409
In the Persian Book of Kings, the hero Rostam
kills a dragon that can make itself invisible.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.450
He does this with the help of his trusty horse,
Rakhsh.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.979
According to the long epic poem: “when Rakhsh
saw the strength of its massive body bearing

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.430
down on Rostam, he laid back his ears and
sank his teeth into the dragon’s shoulders.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.120
He tore at the dragon’s flesh, and the lion-like
Rostam was astonished at his ferocity.”

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.120
Dragons play a significant role in Welsh mythology,
as well.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.090
Wales even has a red dragon on its flag.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.540
And this isn’t just any dragon -- it appears
in the nation’s cultural epic, the Mabinogion.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.650
Ages ago the red dragon was living peacefully
on the British Isles.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.270
And then one day, an all-white dragon invades
and attempts to seize control of Britain.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.750
The red dragon defends its territory, and
the two become locked in a fierce battle.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.060
The noise of their fighting is terrible!

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.090
It causes crops to fail and women to miscarry,
so the British king Lludd digs a huge pit

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.250
and fills it with mead.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180
Turns out dragons, at least British ones,
can’t resist mead.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.989
And so they drink the pit dry and fall into
a deep sleep.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.239
With the two beasts unconscious, Ludd and
his men rush to imprison them.

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.879
Over in England, St. George is famous for
slaying a dragon, though the story takes place

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.660
in Silene, likely modern-day Libya.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.780
There, the country is being tormented by a
dragon, and the only way to appease it is

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.640
to sacrifice a sheep and a virgin ... every
day.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.489
And this goes on for quite some time, but
when the King’s daughter is the chosen virgin,

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.020
St. George appears.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.390
Seems like maybe he could have shown up a
little bit earlier, but in any case he’s

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:44.390
here now.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.450
He charges the dragon and wounds it with a
lance.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.040
Then, he asks the princess for her garter
and throws it around the dragon’s neck.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.480
After this, the dragon is so docile that it
follows the princess back to the capital where

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.189
St. George kills it in the town square after
making all of the people promise to convert

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.360
to Christianity.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.939
Man sometimes mythological stories feel a
LOT like mad libs…

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:19.770
GEORGE defeated a DRAGON with a GARTER and
got the PEASANTS to respect MY BUTT-HEY, STAN.

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:20.770
COME ON.

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.550
Nearby, in Germany, we meet another famous
dragon, Fafnir, who actually started out life

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.280
... as a dwarf prince.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.580
In German mythology, Fafnir and his brother
Regin kill their father, the dwarf king, to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.970
steal his gold.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.780
Then Fafnir takes the gold from his brother
and turns into a dragon to guard it.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.840
Fafnir is killed and his crimes are avenged
by the great hero Sigurd (AKA Siegfried).

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.190
No word on whether he used a giant ice spear
or brought Fafnir back to life as Ice Fafnir.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.280
Also, QUICK ASIDE: if you’ve pulled a caper
that requires you to transform into a dragon,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.600
things probably AREN’T gonna turn out well
for you.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.930
We can find even more tales of dragons, and
some of a slightly different variety, by moving

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.930
to Asia.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.370
According to Lihui Yang and Deming An, authors
of the Handbook of Chinese Mythology, the

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:12.340
dragon “is the controller of the rain, the
river, the sea and all other kinds of water;

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.870
symbol of divine power and energy; great helper
of heroes; and bearer of gods and demigods.”

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.940
To see these Chinese Dragons in action, we’re
going look at a story of creation for dragons

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.840
and humanity alike in the Thoughtbubble.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.410
Long ago, the earth was divided into five
parts.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.000
Birds lived in the east, ruled by the phoenix.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.060
Beasts lived in the south under their king
the tiger.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.590
The west was home to insects, ruled by the
bee.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.620
And the north was occupied by fishes and shrimp
under the benign rule of the giant turtle.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.240
A monkey, with six arms and three heads, lived
in the center.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.210
And one by one the kings of the other four
regions would visit this monkey and have sex

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.210
with her.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.350
Eventually, the monkey became pregnant and
after 9,900 years she gave birth to ninety-nine

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.350
eggs.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.030
All of the eggs, except the biggest one, were
stolen by the kings of the other four realms.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.650
The monkey guarded that last egg until it
hatched.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.400
Out of this egg came ... the python.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.530
His mother ordered him to retrieve the other
ninety-eight eggs, and so off he went on his

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:30.450
quest, defeating and devouring birds, beasts,
insects, fishes AND shrimp that got in his

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.450
way.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.780
But as he ate all that protein, the python
changed appearance.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.240
He grew wings.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.650
His head turned into a bull’s head with
deer horns and a pig’s mouth.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.910
He grew hawk’s legs attached to his serpent’s
torso.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:51.240
He became ... not a python ... but a dragon.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.990
The tiger, the bee, the phoenix and the turtle
were so frightened that they returned the

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.570
other eggs to him without question.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.450
The dragon then broke every egg in turn, each
one giving birth to a new creature.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.470
All of them spread out across the earth, except
the last two.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:14.900
Out of those emerged man and woman, and from
these two people all of the other humans were

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.900
born.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.900
Thanks, Thoughtbubble.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.000
So it’s been a while since we’ve had a
nice creation story.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.580
Maybe you can see just how different this
dragon is from the ones in the Western tradition.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.550
The deer horns and the pig mouth are… notable,
for instance.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.120
Chinese dragons have lots of variation.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.630
In some stories the dragon has a horse’s
head, its eyes are sometimes those of a rabbit.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:40.580
Sometimes it has the scales of a fish and
the abdomen of a clam.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.480
Sometimes tiger paws and sometimes eagle claws.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:49.130
The Chinese dragon also has a special relationship
to water - which we’re going to see in this

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:50.130
next story.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.960
Once, a black dragon is born to a poor human
family in Shandong province, which is a pretty

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.250
serious shock to his human mother.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.530
It’s such a shock that when he starts to
breastfeed, she faints.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.500
And I mean, can you really blame her?

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:09.820
When his father comes home and finds his wife
unconscious with a strange dragon baby, he

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:16.360
grows angry and hits the baby dragon with
a spade, cutting off part of its tail.

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.030
The injured dragon is so upset that he bursts
through the roof and flies away.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:26.520
Many stories say he goes to northeast China
and settles in the Black Dragon River where

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.700
he becomes the river’s god.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:33.430
He takes his mother’s name, Li, and becomes
Short-Tailed Old Li.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:38.150
Years later, back in Shandong province, Short-Tailed
Old Li’s mother dies.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:43.970
The dragon flies back to visit her grave,
which he does every year on the same date,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.560
May 13, to pay his respects.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.280
Each time he returns he brings rain, and so
from then on, he’s worshipped as a rain

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280
god.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.590
Throughout Chinese myths, dragons are associated
with rain and storms.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:59.100
Wherever a dragon appears, there are clouds.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.770
Because of this, the Chinese developed a number
of rituals to get dragons to show up, and

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.270
make it rain during droughts.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.810
One of these is to throw a tiger’s bone
into a pool where a dragon lives.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:14.920
Tigers are the enemies of dragons, and so
their bones should irritate them, causing

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.500
them to fly up wildly from the pool, thus
triggering a storm.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.780
If you don’t have any tiger bones, you can
also try throwing your garbage into the dragon

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:23.780
pool.

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.860
Dragons are notoriously fastidious and their
inability to deal with the mess could force

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:35.070
them to bring rain and wash the pool clean.[1]
Dragons are also used as symbols of royal

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.070
power.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:41.940
From Chinese Imperial Palaces to British heraldry,
kings love to see themselves as harnessing

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.420
the power of dragons.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.200
The Japanese royal family even claimed descent
from dragons.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.730
Daenerys Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne
stems from her status as the mother of dragons.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.900
And yet, there are important differences between
dragons in the east and the west.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:03.210
In the west, dragons are almost always monsters
with fiery breath waiting to be offed by heroes

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.520
or gods.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.860
Killing a dragon is an important rite of passage
for many western heroes, sorta like a violent,

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:14.210
scaly bar mitzvah with swords and fire breath.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:17.020
But, in Asian myths, dragons are often benign.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:22.340
Yes, they’re powerful and fearsome, but
they bring rain instead of fire, which is

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:24.900
usually great news for agrarian people.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.050
At least ... in moderation.

00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:33.510
And most uniquely, in Chinese mythology, sometimes
it’s the dragon that gets to be the hero.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:38.120
Next time we’re going to round out our monster
mash with an episode on those witches of eastwick,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.580
those maidens of malevolence: HAGS.
