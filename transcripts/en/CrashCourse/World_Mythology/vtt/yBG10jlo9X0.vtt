00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Last week we looked at Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian and Islamic apocalypse myths.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And today we're gonna look at one apocalypse myth, one we've all been waiting for. The battle for the ages, the war to end all.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The inspiration for no fewer than 11 metal bands, according to Encyclopedia Metallum.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.200
That's right. It's the Norse apocalypse.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.830
Ragnarok.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:31.109
Battles, earthquakes, fire, blood, a giant wolf, groaning dwarves, and Loki, who is the worst.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.540
That is, until he's not.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.610
Because he dies. Oh! Spoiler alert!

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.499
In many versions of the norse myths

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.220
Ragnarok is the conclusion of one Loki story that we've already covered.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.959
You might remember a few weeks ago when we talked about the beloved god Baldr and his brother Hodr,

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.059
How Loki tricked Hodr into killing Baldr by throwing a dart made of mistletoe and then

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.849
Loki disguises himself as a stubborn frost giant lady in order to prevent Baldr from escaping the underworld

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.920
Eugh, the nerve. That's where we left the story last time.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.800
While Loki may have succeeded in getting rid of Baldr his pleasure is short-lived.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.040
When the rest of the Aesir, the Norse gods of the sky, figure out they've been duped they fly into various rages,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.300
Loki gets scared and poof! Amscrays outta Asgard's way.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.600
The rest of the Aesir form a posse to bring Loki to justice.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.000
Loki decides to hide out in a cave near Frananger Falls.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.700
If anyone comes by he can just transform himself into a salmon and hide in the churning water at the bottom of the waterfall.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.419
And sure enough the Aesir posse shows up. Loki turns into a fish and dives for safety.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:52.000
This is when Kvasir, the wisest of all the Aesir, pulls a Sherlock holmes and notices a burned fishnet in the remains of Loki's fire.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.729
"Fish..." he says to himself.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.339
Why would Loki be thinking about fish?

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.559
So the gods make a new net, Thor uses it to drag the nearby water

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.800
And Loki is caught.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.950
The Aesir decide to not kill Loki, but to punish him and boy, do they ever!

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.600
First they find Vali and transform him into a wolf, then wolf Vali eats Loki's son Narvi,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.000
then the gods take Narvi's entrails and use them to tie down Loki inside a cave

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.100
while Skaði, goddess of skiing, hangs a snake from a stalactite above Loki's head,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.700
positioned so its venom will drop bit by bit,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.800
right onto Loki's face, for eternity.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.600
Somehow Loki's wife Sigyn arranges to stay with her husband

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.529
where she sits and uses a wooden bowl to catch the snake venom

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.500
But even so whenever she gets up to empty the bowl a few drops land right on Loki's face.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.200
Rinse and repeat, except with snake venom, for eternity.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:02.400
Or as Crossley-Holland put it, "That is how things are and how things will remain... Until Ragnarok."

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.200
This is actually where the timing gets a little complicated.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.200
The story of Ragnarok is obviously very old, but it was originally told as a prediction.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.200
This is how the world will end, later.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.400
In theory, Loki is still tied up in that cave somewhere, like, right now, trying to get snake venom off of his face.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.300
So the Ragnarok myth, it's less a story of something that already occurred and more like a script for something that's yet to come.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.600
According to myth we'll know that Ragnarok is nigh because first we'll have Fimbulvinter.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.400
Three long winters, all in a row.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.110
Cold, bitter, unending winters that make people hungry,

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.000
and then angry and then fight and kill each other.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.600
Brothers killing brothers, sisters killing sisters, whole families turning against one another.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.000
Like when you're on vacation and everyone skips lunch.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.300
Civilization crumbles. Buildings are destroyed through war and neglect,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.000
Humanity itself deteriorates and people become like wolves to each other.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.400
And then, when nearly all of the people have killed each other and those who are alive are acting like beasts,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.600
the mythological wolves Sköll and Hati will come out and eat the sun and the moon.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.800
The stars will fade and everything will go dark and cold

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.700
and there will definitely be no more smorgasbords.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.200
Boy Norse howdy! Things haven't even Gotten going yet, because now the earthquakes begin.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.600
We've talked about apocalyptic earthquakes before, the kind that topple trees and crumble mountains,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.800
but these are earthquakes will also cause the Earth itself to shift,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:40.000
and guess what, to break the bonds keeping Loki and his giant monster wolf son Fenrir in captivity.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.800
And once Loki is free, the myth tells us, three roosters will crow,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.200
waking the giants, the warriors of Valhalla, and the dead of single-hockey-stick Hel, the place.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.000
Meanwhile Loki's other son, Jormungandr, the Midgard serpent, will churn through the seas as he heads toward the plain of Vígríðr.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.799
Newly free and awake, Loki will lead his monstrous sons and all the minions of Hel to march on Asgard and challenge the Aesir.

00:05:05.799 --> 00:05:10.750
He'll be joined by the giants, led by Surtr who carries a flaming sword.

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:18.200
As this terrible force marches across the Bifrost towards Asgard, the great rainbow bridge will collapse behind them.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.200
Heimdall, who sees further than any other god, will spot Loki coming and sound the Gjallarhorn in warning.

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.600
The all-father Odin, seeing the impending battle, will turn to his trusted adviser Mimir for advice

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:40.200
but when giants are marching and your rainbow bridge is in pieces and Fenrir and the Midgard serpent are loose... A pep talk isn't really gonna help.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.300
And so the Aesir will gear up for battle alongside the Einherjar, 800 of the most honorable Dead Warriors from Valhalla.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.029
The Aesir and the Einherjar will follow Odin to the plain of Vígríðr to face Loki's onslaught,

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.000
perhaps best dealt with in the Thought Bubble.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.200
the battle begins and quickly turns into a collection of heroic duels.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.200
The fight doesn't go well for anyone. Tyr and Garmr kill each other in battle,

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:15.200
Thor defeats Jormungandr but not before the dying serpent spews venom all over the thunder god and Thor falls, poisoned.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.600
Even Loki and Heimdall fight so savagely that they slay each other,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.000
which I guess means someone else will have to be the worst now? Anyone have any nominations?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.399
As for Odin, he attacks with his mighty spear, Gungnir

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.000
But Fenrir seizes Odin in his mighty jaws and swallows the all-father.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.200
With Odin consumed an unlikely hero arises: Odin's son Víðarr and his great magic shoe.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.700
Víðarr's mythical shoe is made up of all the thrown-away scraps of all the shoes that have been made since the beginning of time.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.000
It is huge and indestructible.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.200
And so Víðarr stomps his mythic shoe down of Fenrir's bottom jaw,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.600
grabs the wolf's top jaw and rips his head apart;

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.800
Guitar solo.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:07.200
The end of the battle comes when Surtr, leader of the giants, finally defeats Freyr.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.700
He turns, with his flaming sword sets all the worlds aflame.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.100
According to one version of the story,

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.600
Asgard and Midgard and Jotunheim and Niflheim will become furnaces -

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.600
places of raging flame, swirling smoke, ashes, only ashes.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.200
The Einherjar will die, men and women and childre in Midgard will die,

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.000
elves and dwarves will die, giants will die, monsters and creatures of the underworld will die,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.200
birds and animals will die. The sun will be dark and there will be no stars in the sky.

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.000
The earth will sink into the sea.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.600
Okay, so look, Ragnarok doesn't end well.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:52.500
The world has been destroyed by flames and all the people and all the gods are dead and everything is darkness.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:56.100
Except in this end of the world story there is a silver lining.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.000
Because the worlds are consumed by flames what remains is water,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.500
and as we've seen in creation stories, water has some pretty impressive generative powers.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:10.900
Accordingly, "The earth will rise again out of the water, fair and green.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:16.600
The eagle will fly over cataracts, swoop into the thunder and catch fish under crags.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.700
Corn will ripen in fields that were never sown."

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.949
But hold on, it gets even better.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.699
It turns out that not all of the gods perished in the massive inferno.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:30.200
Odin's sons Víðarr and Vali and Thor's sons Magni and Móði survive the fire.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.600
They make their way to the plain of Iðavöllr,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.800
where they're joined by Baldr and Hodr, who have come back from the world of the dead.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.600
Hoenir and the children of Vili and Ve round out a new pantheon.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:45.000
The best part is what happens when these new gods gather together.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.800
They sit down and they talk, telling the stories that only they know,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.300
the same stories of the Norse gods that we are talking about right now.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:57.640
In the grass of Iðavöllr they find some of the treasures of the Aesir,

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.900
including Mjolnir and special golden chess boards and their pieces.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:07.800
In a recent retelling of the Ragnarok story by Neil Gaiman, these pieces are the characters from the myths:

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.200
Loki and his children, the frost giants and Surtr.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:19.100
Gaiman ends the story writing: "Baldr will smile like the sun coming out, and reach down, and he will move his first piece.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.200
There's a lot to unpack in the Ragnarok myth.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.800
Starting with whether or not it's really a reflection of the pre-Christian Germanic tradition.

00:09:25.869 --> 00:09:30.100
You probably noticed a lot of similarities between the Christian story of the apocalypse:

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.300
from the blowing of the horns to the earthquake and the fire...

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:39.000
But more importantly the most beautiful and beloved of the gods, in this case Baldr, returns from the dead.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:44.200
Our main sources for this story, the Eddas, were written down well after Christianity

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.800
became dominant in Northern Europe and Iceland.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.300
Were the original myths influenced by Christianity?

00:09:49.339 --> 00:09:51.600
Well, it depends upon which scholar you ask.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.200
Interestingly, unlike some of the other apocalypses,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.000
this one is a beginning as well as an end.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.500
The Christian and Zoroastrian stories also establish the beginning of a new age,

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.900
but Ragnarok, even though it's clearly set in the future,

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.000
prefigures a renewed world that looks a lot like the old one.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.400
In Gaiman's retelling we almost have the feeling that Ragnarok has happened,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.200
even if we're specifically told its events are in the future.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:20.800
The idea that the end of the world can also be the beginning of the world isn't unique, though.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.400
In Hindu mythology the fourth age, also known as the Kali age,

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:29.600
sees humans afflicted by corrupt rulers and all the social order upended.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.400
As in the Norse story, the world will be consumed first by drought and then by fire,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:40.100
followed by a storm lasting many years, and the rebirth of a new world here on Earth.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:45.500
The cyclical nature of the Hindu myth as well as the twisting of time is expressed this way:

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:52.000
"A day of Brahma, born from the lotus, lasts a thousand periods of four ages;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.609
a night, when the world is destroyed and made into a vast ocean, is of the same length.

00:10:57.769 --> 00:11:05.900
and at the end of the night, Vishnu, unborn, having awakened, takes the form of Brahma in order to create,

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.169
as it has already been told to you.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:13.000
This Indian apocalypse story and Ragnarok are both oddly hopeful.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.400
They explain that destruction is necessary for creation.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.800
Unlike the apocalypse of the Bible's book of revelations, they don't promise a new world only for the righteous,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.969
but a rebirth for everyone!

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.000
You get a rebirth, and you get a rebirth, and you get a rebirth!

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.059
