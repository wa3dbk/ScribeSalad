00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.970
Hi I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology, and today we’re wrapping up creation

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:05.970
myths.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.400
Over the past four episodes we’ve seen the
universe created from nothing, via the actions

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.860
of earth mothers, sky fathers, and of course,
vomiting supreme beings.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.689
We’ve seen creation used to explore the
relationships between parents and children

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.460
and between men and women.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.460
And snakes.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.150
And on that note, today, we’re going to
examine the earthly interconnection between

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.470
humans and animals.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.140
High five, Thoth!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.140
What?

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.499
Yes, I know humans are animals.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:39.810
You know what I mean.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.310
INTRO
Before we get into the creation myths, let’s

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.250
start with a little scientific mythology about
man’s best friend.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.140
Of course, I mean dogs.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.680
Sorry Thoth.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.470
Dogs were, if not the first, then among the
first domesticated animals, and they play

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.420
an important role in mythology.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.420
Romulus?

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.420
Remus?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.710
I’m looking in your direction.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.519
One of the stories that we tell about the
domestication of dogs is that it started when

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.009
early hunter gatherers chose to tame and then
breed some of the less aggressive wolves in

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.500
order to increase the hunters’ capacity
to capture game.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.929
Eventually, these cross and interbred wolves
became dogs.

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:19.249
Who’s a good boy?

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:20.280
Who’s a good boy?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.280
Thats Right!

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.520
Any canine that didn’t bite off your hand
is a good boy!

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.119
It’s a nice story and it seems to make sense,
but there are problems with it.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.859
In an article in National Geographic, Brian
Hare and Vanessa Woods argue that some scientists

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.600
are flipping this narrative on its head and
saying that it was wolves that sought out

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.899
humans, rather than the other way around.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.100
It doesn’t make much sense for humans to
try to capture wolves and get them to work

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.190
for us.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.280
Early hunter gatherers were pretty good at
hunting, which is why they might have been

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.560
to blame for the destruction of megafauna
in the prehistoric world.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.170
Also, why would humans want to share the spoils
of the hunt with a wolf?

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.439
They’re hungry.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:57.439
Like the wolf.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.450
Hare and Woods explain that scientists think
it is more likely that wolves approached humans,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.679
probably by scavenging around their garbage
pits.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.250
These would have been the friendliest wolves;
aggressive ones would have been killed by

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.450
anxious humans.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.920
So, it was the friendly wolves that, over
many generations, were bred into the loveable

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.830
vacuum hating rapscallions that we know and
love.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.980
Don’t ask me about cats, though.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.680
I got nothing there.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.349
Are cats even really domesticated?

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.050
I feel like they’re hiding something.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.050
There’s some plot.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.160
They’re up to something.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.610
Let’s return, as we so often do, to the
Judeo-Christian Biblical story of creation

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.849
from Genesis.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.970
In Chapter One, after creating the heavens
and the earth and the stars and all the animals:

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.260
God said, “Let us make man in our image,
after our likeness; and let them have dominion

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.910
over the fish of the sea, and over the birds
of the air, and over the cattle, and over

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.730
all the earth and over every creeping thing
that creeps upon the earth.”

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.959
So God created man in his own image, in the
image of God he created him; male and female

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:59.959
he created them.”

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.849
(Gen 1 26-27) … And God said, “Behold
I have given you every plant yielding seed

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.099
which is upon the face of all the earth and
every tree with every seed in its fruit; you

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.269
shall have them for food.

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.829
And to every beast of the earth, and to every
bird of the air, and to everything that creeps

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.670
on the earth, everything that has breath of
life, I have given every green plant for food.”

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.670
And it was so.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.670
(Gen 1 29-30).

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.670
Sounds like more gardening to me, surprise
surprise.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.709
In the second chapter of Genesis, God grants
humans control over the other earthly creatures

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.630
in a slightly different way.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.849
In this version, God creates man before the
animals.

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.439
Then the LORD God said, “It is not good
that man should be alone; I will make him

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.290
a helper fit for him.”

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.790
So out of the ground the Lord God formed every
beast of the field and every bird of the air,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.950
and brought them to the man to see what he
would call them; and whatever the man called

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.719
every living creature, that was its name.”

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.760
(Gen 2 18-19)
Isn’t that nice?

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.450
Giraffes and sharks and biting flies were
made just to help us.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.709
Both creation stories set up a clear hierarchy
in the animal world with human beings at the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.500
top given the power to do whatever they want
with all animals below them.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.590
Basically, they’re our interns.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.629
The second version of the story affirms human
control over animals in two ways.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.979
First, by having man created prior to the
animal kingdom, humans are granted literal

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.039
primacy.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.500
Then, their power is increased over animals
by the first man receiving the privilege of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.500
naming them.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.150
And, I mean, he did a pretty good job.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.060
Especially with hippopotamus.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.020
But not all myths about humans and animals
employ this strict hierarchy.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.820
In a number of creation stories from Native
American tribes animals are partners in creation,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.340
often acting as guides or even as the key
participants in creating the earth.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.069
The tribes of what is now the Southwestern
United States have creation stories that follow

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.639
a model we haven’t yet seen, the emergence
myth.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.650
In these stories, humans or creatures that
become humans are led from an original underground

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.259
world into a series of interim worlds until
they emerge into the surface world that is

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:05.979
recognizably earth.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:11.300
In a Hopi version of this story, various animals
including the Spider Grandmother, and a chipmunk

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.440
help to find the entry hole or sipapuni, to
the land beyond the sky.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.240
Apparently, there is one of these entry ways
in the Grand Canyon.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.240
In a Navajo version of the emergence story,
the people, who are also sort of insects,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.250
fly through the sipapuni into the higher world,
assisted by swallows.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.990
I like these myths.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.360
Humans working with nature!

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.690
Literally rising towards creation!

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.289
It’s just a nice breath of fresh air, almost
literally, after all the vomiting and death

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:41.360
that we’ve had so far.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.540
Another type of creation story featuring animal
helpers is called the earth diver myth.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.270
A good example comes from the Iroquois Indians
of the Northeastern Woodlands of the United

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.270
States.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.270
Let’s dive into Thoughtbubble.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.390
A long time ago, humans lived up in the sky
in what we now consider heaven.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.889
The daughter of their great chief became very
sick, and they were unable to cure her.

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:05.680
In the village was a great tree on which grew
the corn that had fed all the people.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.690
One of the chief’s friends had a dream in
which he was told to tell the chief to lay

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.280
his daughter beside the tree and dig it up.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.710
The chief did as the dream said.

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.180
While this was going on an angry young man
came along.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.629
The angry young man didn’t have the best
bedside manner.

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.050
He pointed out the tree provided the fruit
which fed the people, and gave the sick daughter

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.949
a push with his foot.

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:32.430
She fell through the hole that had been left
when the tree had been dug up.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:37.440
The young woman fell into this world, which
at the time was all water.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.319
On this water floated ducks, and geese and
all the other water birds.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.650
As there was no earth on this water at the
time, there was no place for the falling woman

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.860
to land, so the birds joined their bodies
together into a sort of duck island, where

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.169
the falling woman landed.

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:56.980
After some time, the birds grew tired and
asked who would care for the woman.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:02.040
The Great Turtle took the woman, and when
he grew tired he asked who would take care

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.040
of her.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.389
They decided to prepare land on which she
would live-- the earth.

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:11.789
The Toad, after some convincing, dove to the
bottom of the primal sea, and collected soil

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.129
which was placed on the broad carapace of
the Great Turtle.

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:21.380
It increased in size until it provided the
land to accommodate all the living creatures.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:22.380
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.340
And nice work, water birds.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.470
Also, Toad.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.669
Thoth, meet Toad.

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.340
So there’s a lot more to the myth than this,
but it captures the key elements of the earth

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.530
diver story.

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.110
Although it has some things in common with
other creation myths we’ve seen, especially

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:43.690
the idea that the world began as water, the
relationship between human beings and animals

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:44.740
it’s quite different.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.161
For one thing, far from being dumb creatures
waiting to be named and tamed by a man, these

00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:53.300
animals can talk, think, deliberate and plan.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.300
Animal empowerment!

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.780
They also have emotions similar to the ones
we feel, especially getting tired and bored

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.310
of a tedious task.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:04.340
Think about this the next time you watch a
horse pull a cart, or you’re trying to entertain

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:06.669
your cat by waving that feathery thing in
front him.

00:08:06.669 --> 00:08:08.319
I’m telling you: they’re gettin’ fed
up.

00:08:08.319 --> 00:08:13.039
Even more important than being given real
agency in this creation story, it’s the

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:17.949
animals who both save humans’ progenitors,
and create our home.

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:22.699
Without the helpful turtle and the brave toad,
there would be no land to live on, and also

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:24.560
no earth to grow food.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.689
The creation of the world requires animals
and thus it is crucially important to be grateful

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:31.689
to them.

00:08:31.689 --> 00:08:34.919
These Native American myths are very intricate
and when you read them – and you should

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.810
– it’s important to remember that they
are very different from many of the other

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:44.660
creation stories because they are living stories,
communicated by way of a constantly evolving

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:48.839
oral tradition, unlike more or less stable
literary texts.

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:52.920
Still, one of the interpretive take-aways
from these emergence and earth diver stories

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.120
is that Native Americans perceive a different
relationship between animals and nature and

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.670
humans than people from other traditions.

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:06.079
According to the biblical tradition, human
beings have a special relationship with God

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:09.750
who prefers them to all other creatures.

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.899
According to mythology professors Eva Thury
and Margaret Devinney, “This privilege has

00:09:13.899 --> 00:09:19.850
been interpreted by some as giving believers
the right to dispose of nature as they please.”

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:24.230
On the other hand, according to these scholars,
“Native Americans view this world … as

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.970
the place where their destinies will be fulfilled,
not by domination but by maintaining a balance

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:36.110
achieved by living in harmony with themselves
and other humans as well as with animals and

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.589
the exterior world.”

00:09:37.589 --> 00:09:41.579
Now some of you might be saying, wait, this
sounds like a stereotypical view of Native

00:09:41.579 --> 00:09:45.520
Americans, like they have some mystical connection
with nature and that we should look to them

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.390
for a way to understand how better to live
in harmony with it.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:52.520
And you would be right, that is a cultural
stereotype, one that has often been uncritically

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.209
linked with an idea of Native Americans as
primitive.

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:59.850
But, I will say, maybe in comparison to the
other stories we’ve heard, with all the

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:05.570
vomiting, and wars, and eating of children,
it’s kind of nice think of the universe

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:10.110
as a place of collaboration, and not one of
acrimony.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:41.649
Except that jerk who kicked 
that lady down the hole.

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:47.019
Thanks for watching.

00:10:47.019 --> 00:10:52.920
See you next episode.
