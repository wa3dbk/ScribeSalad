Hi, I’m Mike Rugnetta this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today we’re returning to one

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.600
of the world’s favorite texts, The Epic
of Gilgamesh!

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.060
This is one of the oldest written stories
in the world. And it’s a great illustration

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.430
of Joseph Campbell’s monomythic hero’s
journey introduced last episode. Plus it has

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:28.310
sacred trees, lovestruck goddesses, and a
fearsome demon named Humbaba. To Sumeria!

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.319
INTRO
The Epic of Gilgamesh is more than four thousand

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:42.879
years old. Written versions of the story date
back to 2100 BCE, which gives it incredible

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.670
historical value. For instance, several versions
of the Gilgamesh story use both Sumerian and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.969
Akkadian names for gods, which shows -how
the story might have passed orally between

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.329
the cultures of ancient Mesopotamia. This
could also be considered syncretism – when

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.440
two religious traditions combine over time.
In this episode, we’re gonna work from a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.210
version of the epic written around 1200 BCE,
and see how Gilgamesh himself fits into the

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.799
hero’s journey. A fair bit of warning though:
in this story, there is a brief mention of

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.020
rape.
At the start of our tale, Gilgamesh is the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.350
king of Uruk, and he’s both a bad guy and
a bad king. His subjects are unhappy, he disrespects

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.280
the gods, and he’s a serial rapist. So,
basically he’s the opposite of a hero.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.619
But Gilgamesh, like many “heroes” has
divine parentage – a goddess mom and human

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.200
king dad. Somehow this makes him two-thirds
god and one-third man? Try not to think too

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.640
hard about the math on that one. But either
way he’s still mortal, and that’s hard

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.249
for him to accept.
Eventually, Gilgamesh has a number of crazy

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.030
adventures. He chops down some famous trees,
and meets his best friend Enkidu, who helps

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.160
Gilgamesh become a better man and a better
king. When Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh goes to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.710
the underworld to try to bring him back. He
fails, however, and then must admit that he’s

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.830
human after all. In the end, Gilgamesh i s
considered a hero not just for his incredible

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.510
deeds, but for coming to understand and accept
his true nature.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.760
But ok, let’s backtrack. Because along the
way, Gilgamesh manages to check off nearly

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.450
every single heroic scene that we learned
about in the last episode. We’re gonna count

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.330
‘em up, one by one. Play along from home!
Every time you see a heroic scene, shout it

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.720
out. But ugh, I’m pretty far away, so just
make sure that you shout, like, really…

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.730
REALLY loudly.
So! Things get started in the Epic when Gilgamesh

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.310
and Enkidu first meet. Right away they decide
to wrestle each other, and realizing that

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.760
they’re evenly matched, they reach a stalemate.
This is a heroic trope in its own right (just

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.200
not one of Campbell’s); think Robin Hood
and Little John, Arthur and Lancelot, or Vin

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.340
Diesel and
Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson in Fast Five.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.020
After dusting themselves off and becoming
bffs, Gilgamesh and Enkidu return to Uruk

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.530
to do kingly stuff. But Enkidu–who’s used
to living in the wilderness–he gets bored.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.140
Gilgamesh proposes they head to the forest
and face off against a terrifying demon adversary:

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.660
Humbaba. Yeah, it’s just, it’s not a very
threatening name, I know. But trust me, he’s

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.830
a big deal, very terrifying. But did you see
what happened? This is what Campbell would

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.870
call the Announcement of the Quest (1).
To prep for the journey, Gilgamesh and Enkidu

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.560
get Supernatural Aid (2) in the form of some
special weaponry. Then they have a quick Refusal

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.390
of the Quest (3) as Enkidu, who knows the
power of Humbaba, tries to warn Gilgamesh:

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:39.070
“Humbaba, whose shout is the flood weapon,
whose utterance is Fire and whose breath is

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.060
Death, can hear for a distance of sixty leagues
through the forest, so who can penetrate his

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.090
forest? Debility would seize anyone who penetrated
his forest.”

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.690
But Gilgamesh persists. Gilgamesh and Enkidu
meet the Goddess (4), Gilgamesh’s mom Ninsun.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.800
She’s not particularly happy with her son’s
plan, but she blesses Gilgamesh and adopts

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:08.000
Enkidu. In the forest Enkidu warns Gilgamesh
about its gates saying how afraid he is to

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.360
Cross the Threshold (5). But once again, Gilgamesh
persists, and the two venture forth into the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.780
darkness of the forest...now deep in the Belly
of the Whale (6).

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.440
And we’re going to follow them right in.
Thoughtbubble, take us in there. Creeping

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.030
through the pine forest, Enkidu and Gilgamesh
prepare to confront Humbaba. Before long,

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.400
the earth shakes and the sky goes dark. Humbaba
is upon them! Humbaba is massive, with the

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.720
face of a lion, or scales, or vulture feet,
or a snake tail – depending on which version

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.020
you read...but, nonetheless, very fearsome!
Undeterred, Gilgamesh and Enkidu leap into

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.750
battle. With Supernatural Aid (7) from the
god Shamash, and some divine winds that bind

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.620
Humbaba, Gilgamesh slays the demon and removes
its head.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.170
If you’re keeping score at home, this step
is technically “Atonement with the Father

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.940
(8)”. Humbaba can be read as a terrible,
overbearing Father figure that must be, well,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.430
not so much atoned with as, you know, beheaded.
After the glorious battle, Gilgamesh and Enkidu

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:15.260
fell a bunch of sacred trees, build a raft,
and sail home with Humbaba’s noggin. Once

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.120
home, Gilgamesh takes a bath and puts on some
royal robes in anticipation of his Meeting

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:27.540
with a Goddess (9). In this case, the goddess
is Ishtar, who definitely has a thing for

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.340
Gilgamesh. She says: “Come to me Gilgamesh
and be my lover! Bestow upon me the gift of

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.730
your fruit! You can be my husband, and I can
be your wife.”

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.090
Gilgamesh refuses Ishtar’s advances, though
– maybe he just wasn’t ready to share

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.400
his fruit – which makes this scene Woman
as Temptress (10). Insulted, Ishtar sends

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:55.651
the Bull of Heaven to kill Gilgamesh, who
with Enkidu, kills the bull. But Enkidu, who

00:05:55.651 --> 00:06:03.220
just does not know when to quit, slaps Ishtar
with a chunk of said bull. Not. Smart. Friendo.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.810
And with that beefy slap, Enkidu seals his
fate. The life drains from his body, he gets

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.440
sicker and sicker and ... dies.
Thank you Thoughtbubble. With Enkidu dead,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.711
Gilgamesh is at a turning point. He thought
he’d finished his hero’s journey! After

00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:24.380
travelling to the ends of the earth, defeating
his “dad”, and returning home with a gross

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:30.100
bloody trophy… HE PUT ON ROBES! He was DONE!
But now, with the loss of his best friend,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:36.690
Gilgamesh feels yet another call to adventure.
So, he leaves Uruk to roam the country, wondering:

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:44.991
“Shall I die too? Am I not like Enkidu?
Grief has entered my innermost being. I am

00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:52.440
afraid of Death and so I roam open country.”
Gilgamesh is on another heroic quest, this

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.680
time to overcome death and live eternally.
He resolves to find Utnapishtim, who you might

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.720
remember from a previous episode – he’s
the dude who was granted immortality after

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.470
surviving the great flood. Along the way,
Gilgamesh crosses the mountains that guard

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.950
the rising and setting sun and confronts monstrous
Scorpion men.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.380
Crossing the mountains means another Crossing
the Threshold (11) and crossing this threshold

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:23.650
means Gilgamesh is in the Belly of yet another
Whale, walking through ten leagues of darkness.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.270
Eventually, stumbling through the dark, Gilgamesh
has another Meeting with the Goddess. This

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:33.410
time it’s Siduri, the goddess of beer and
wisdom, two things that don’t often go together.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.910
Siduri tells Gilgamesh that to meet Utnapishtim,
Gilgamesh must cross lethal waters with the

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:45.330
boatman Ur-shanabi. Gilgamesh thanks Siduri
for the beer, sets off, and finds Ur-shanabi.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.669
Immediately, Gilgamesh bashes Ur-shanabi over
the head. Which just, that seems very, very

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:56.410
rude – I mean, why would Gilgamesh treat
Ur-shanabi so Ur-shabbily? [beat] Anyways,

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.620
I suppose maybe clobbering is the only way
that Gilgamesh know how to communicate with

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.810
people who aren’t goddesses.
In addition to bashing Ur-shanabi over the

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:08.510
head, Gilgamesh smashes all of the “things
of stone.” Which is unfortunate because

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.270
it turns out that those “things of stone”
are the tools Ur-shanabi needs to cross the

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:18.890
water. So Gilgamesh has yet another task – he
must cut down trees to make punting poles.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:23.800
Finally, Ur-shanabi shows Gilgamesh how to
use the poles to cross the lethal waters and

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:31.250
reach Utnapishtim. But when he does Gilgamesh
can’t exactly celebrate. Utnapishtim challenges

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.229
him. He asks:
“Why have you exerted yourself? What have

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:40.649
you achieved?
You have made yourself weary for lack of sleep,

00:08:40.649 --> 00:08:45.430
You only fill your flesh with grief,
You only bring the distant days of reckoning

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:50.499
closer.
Mankind’s fame is cut down like reeds in

00:08:50.499 --> 00:08:54.230
a reed-bed
Nobody sees the face of Death

00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:01.959
Nobody hears the voice of Death.
Savage Death just cuts mankind down.”

00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:09.420
This isn’t...exactly... the the answer Gilgamesh
was hoping for. Is Utnapishtim going to turn

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:15.790
him away? Is he doomed to remain mortal? Gilgamesh
persists, so Utnapishtim tells him his own

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:21.100
story – about the flood, being chosen by
Ea, the gods granting him immortality. And

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:26.750
this is a revelation to Gilgamesh, the truth
of immortality, and it serves as his Apotheosis

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.540
(12).
Utnapishtim decides if Gilgamesh really wants

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.300
to be immortal – fine. But to prove his
worth, he has to complete a Road of Trials

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:41.070
(13) with just one, simple task. Gilgamesh
must stay awake for six days and seven nights.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:47.529
No problem, Gilgamesh says. Easy, he snorts.
He plops down on a rock and–having walked

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:50.759
in the darkness for over ten leagues–instantly
falls asleep. Whoops!

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:57.319
Even though Gilgamesh failed his test, Utnapishtim
gives him an out. If he really wants to avoid

00:09:57.319 --> 00:10:03.040
death there’s a secret plant, a root like
a camel-thorn. If he can track it down, it’ll

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.790
bring him great rejuvenation. This will be
his Ultimate Boon (14).

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:13.029
So does Gilgamesh get his magic plant? Yes
and no. He manages to find it growing deep

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:17.759
underwater, and by tying stones to his feet,
manages to sink down, snip a sample, and float

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:22.910
back up to the surface. After this, he sets
off for his Great Return (15) to civilization.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:28.679
But. After all that. On his way home, Boon
in hand...Gilgamesh decides that he should

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:35.800
stop and take a bath. While he’s soaking,
a snake slithers up, sneaks behind him, curls

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:42.470
around the plant and disappears. As he towels
himself off, he sees the plant is gone and

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:51.990
is just... defeated. He sits down and weeps.
Gilgamesh must return home empty handed.

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:59.420
So - what is heroism? Gilgamesh is a mighty
warrior who stands up to terrible monsters

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:04.879
and discovers the secret of immortality, but
who ultimately fails in his quest. Over the

00:11:04.879 --> 00:11:09.670
course of the story he has almost all the
experiences set forth in Campbell’s monomyth,

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:14.860
sometimes more than once. But is this what
makes him a hero?

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:19.220
Really, Gilgamesh is kind of an ambivalent
figure. His journey has many successes, but

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.309
also many failures. His bravery – or lack
of respect – allows him to challenge and

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:30.139
kill Humbaba, but also gets Enkidu killed.
He proudly announces that he’s up to Utnapishtim’s

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:35.000
challenge, but he simply isn’t. At the end
of the epic, Gilgamesh comes to terms with

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.600
his limitations as a human. This completes
the journey, achieving the final, crucial

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:48.389
step – having the power and wisdom to live
a good life. Not an eternal life, but a good

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:54.579
one. In Gilgamesh’s case, that means one
where you aren’t a terrible king. Eva Thury

00:11:54.579 --> 00:11:57.759
and Margaret Devinney sum up Gilgamesh’s
heroism pretty well:

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:02.749
“Gilgamesh wants to escape human limitations,
to get answers to questions not available

00:12:02.749 --> 00:12:09.279
to his contemporaries, and perhaps most importantly,
he wants to overcome mortality both for himself

00:12:09.279 --> 00:12:14.890
and others. But ultimately his story shows
us that, despite his extraordinary talents,

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:20.899
in these matters he is not different from
other humans. Thus, we see that it is precisely

00:12:20.899 --> 00:12:25.129
his human limitations that make him truly
heroic.”

00:12:25.129 --> 00:12:33.149
So, is he perfect? No. Is he even a role model?
Definitely not. But can he serve as a symbol

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:41.420
for an aspect of the human condition, of growing
past mistakes and accepting limitations? Maybe.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.959
And perhaps THAT is what makes him a “hero”.
Next week we’ll see just how many heroes

00:12:46.959 --> 00:12:50.829
might be lurking where you’re not expecting
them. Oh! And also, we’re gonna talk about

00:12:50.829 --> 00:13:34.989
an army of flying monkeys that I may or may
not call “my pretties”. Thanks 

00:13:34.989 --> 00:13:39.329
for watching. We’ll see you soon!
