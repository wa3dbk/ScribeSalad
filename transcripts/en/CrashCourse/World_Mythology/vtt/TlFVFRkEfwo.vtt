00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200
Hey there, I'm Mike. This is Crash Course Mythology, and today, we're gonna pick up where we left off last week, talking about sex.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.600
Mythological sex. Legendary sex! Sex that results in the creation of the world.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.400
There's also gonna be more castration, and also dwarfs

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.880
Stop hiding, Thoth! You can handle it.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.000
This time, we'll focus, not only on sex itself, but on a common side effect: children.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.320
Mostly adorable mythological babies, but there are also those who are self-begotten

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:35.200
Like our own Thoth, and also like Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom, who sprang fully-grown from the foreheads of their fathers.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.080
Long before epidurals were invented too. Yeowch...

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:47.140
[Opening Theme]

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.780
Last week, we started with spitting, vomiting fathers, some of whom managed to pull of creation without any female counterpart.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
In general, though, the world's creation myths include some kind of duality.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.760
Whether it's that separation of male and female, light and dark, good and evil, or day and night

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.100
The idea of "Mother Earth" is a pretty common one in the west, and it's been remarkably persistent.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:20.400
In fact, in the 1970s, British scientist James Lovelock updated the myth in a scientific hypothesis, defining "Mother Earth," Under her Greek name, Gaia, as:

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.680
So, let's begin with the mother of them all: Gaia.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.100
According to Hesiod:

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.280
And a bunch of other supernatural beings, including Coeus, Crius, Theia, Rhea, Memory (Greek name Mnemosne)

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.840
Phoebe, Tethys, and most important for us in this episode, Cronus, God of Time, and... future castrator.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.420
These beings are called the Titans

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:34.060
Gaia also bore the one-eyed cyclopses, and the Hecatoncheires, who were giants with a hundred arms, and fifty heads

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.580
That were so scary, that Heaven (Uranus) hid them away in a cavern, inside of Earth (Gaia), called Tartarus, which made Earth... angry.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.600
But really, can you blame Heaven? Those are fifty faces only a mother could love...

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:55.700
Before we get into all the incest and castration that follows, let's pause and think about why people might want to characterize Earth as a mother, rather than a father.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.080
One obvious answer is that, traditionally, mothers are the ones who give birth (unless we're talking about seahorses).

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.800
So it's not a huge stretch to think of creation as coming from mothers.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.120
And mothers are nurturing, in the biological sense: that they provide physical food for infants.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:20.200
By the same token, in agricultural societies, and probably hunter-gatherer and herding cultures too, the Earth provides the food that people and animals need to live.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.800
So the metaphor of "Mother Earth" makes a lot of sense.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.920
The mothers of myths aren't always the most doting, and they're often pretty powerful.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.720
In many myths, they love their children a lot more than their husbands, who, to be fair, can be apocalyptically horrible.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.640
Let's go back to the Greeks.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:47.100
We saw in a previous episode what happened when Earth, or Gaia, was ticked off that Sky, AKA Ouranos, had locked up her fifty-headed children.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.300
She gave a sickle to her son Cronus, who castrated his dad, and as a result, Aphrodite was born.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:59.520
Surprisingly, Ouranos didn't harbor too many hard feelings, maybe because he and Gaia knew that it would soon be curtains for Cronus.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.400
At the hands of his own children no less

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.100
We're gonna see this prophesy about a son overthrowing, or possibly even killing, his father... a lot.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.420
And your parents were worried about your goth phase. Ugh...

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:18.440
Cronus, knowing what he had done to his own father, was understandably nervous about HIS children, born to his sister Rhea.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.580
Again, incest, pretty common in cosmologies and pantheons...

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.400
Actually, maybe we can just have some kind of... Incest Alert, instead of me mentioning it every time it comes up?

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.040
Yeah. That's perfect. That's great

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.960
So, as each of his children were born, Cronus took them up, and swallowed them.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.380
As Hesiod tells us:

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.520
In the same way that Gaia was upset about Ouranos imprisoning the Hecatoncheires, Rhea was not thrilled about Cronus eating all of her children.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.000
So with the help of her parents, she came up with a plan.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.540
When her son Zeus was about to be born, Rhea snuck off to Crete to give birth, and handed baby Zeus off to his grandma, Gaia

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.400
Rhea then wrapped a stone in a onesie, showed it to Cronus, who (no big surprise) grabbed the stone, and ate it.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.880
Apparently he had very strong teeth, and also was somehow unfamiliar with the density of your standard baby, but hey. Okay.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.680
Zeus grew up, and he set to work overthrowing his dad. and fulfilling the prophesy, 'cause that's how prophesies work.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.140
Knowing that he needed help to unseat his father and the other Titans, and also to set his siblings free from daddy's tummy,

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.800
Zeus released those fifty-headed hecatoncheires, and together, they went to war.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.900
He also freed Rhea's other children, and together, they defeated the Titans, and Zeus and his fam became the Gods of the Greeks.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:51.120
Like I said, this idea of the son rising up to supplant the father, causing a war in Heaven, is pretty common in a number of creation stories.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.080
For example, in the Norse creation myth from the Prose Edda, an old Norse text, we find the evil frost giant Ymir

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:08.160
Who not only created man and woman from his sweaty left armpit, which explains a lot when you think about it, but also created a family of frost giants.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:17.400
And also also, somehow, another man named Búri, who has a son named Borr, who in turn married Bestla, the daughter of the frost giant Boelthor

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.300
Because, I guess alliteration was in the style at the time.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.460
Bestla gave birth to three sons: Vili, Vé, and Odin.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.540
So here's where the story gets really interesting. Thought Bubble?

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.760
The three brothers, Vili, Vé, and Odin, HATED Ymir and the other frost giants (even though they created them. Notice the emerging theme here?)

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:42.900
So then they battled and defeated them, killing Ymir, then the three gods used Ymir's body to create the world.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.600
His flesh became Earth. His bones became mountains and stones.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:55.280
His blood served well to make the lakes that dotted the world, and the seas that surrounded it, and his skull was used for the sky.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:01.800
And, yes! This does sound a lot like the Chinese creation myth of P'an Ku, with a skull, instead of a cosmic egg.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.060
But I guess god blood always turns into water... Anyway.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.500
A dwarf stood at each of the four corners of the sky. The dwarfs were named East, West, North, and South

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.380
The gods made the sun and moon from the sparks of Múspell. To the giants, they assigned a place called Jotunheim

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:25.260
The brothers then created a fertile land called Midgard from Ymir's eyebrows, and they created a man from a fallen ash tree, and a woman from a fallen elm.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:30.520
Odin gave them life, Vili gave them intelligence and emotions, and Vé gave them senses.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.800
Ask was the man, and Embla was the woman.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.800
These were the parents of the human race.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:43.600
And because the Norse gods were very into upcycling, out of the maggots that had come from Ymir's rotting flesh, the gods made dwarfs.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.500
More dwarfs!

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:51.160
As for the sons of Borr, they formed a family of gods and goddesses called the Æsir, led by the father god, Odin.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:58.760
They built a wonderous home over Midgard, and called it Asgard. The two zones were linked by the rainbow bridge, Bifröst

00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.600
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:07.920
We'll be hearing more about these gods of Asgard later, but right now, I want to use this myth as a "rainbow bridge," my favorite kind of bridge, to a similar creation story.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:14.660
Fans of Crash Course World History know that we love the Epic of Gilgamesh, but there's another sacred text from that part of the world:

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:19.640
The Enuma Elish, from Babylonia, that gives us one of the worlds oldest creation stories

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.920
And hey, surprise, it features a war between younger gods and their parents.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:30.620
As a bonus, it also has: primordial waters, an angry mother goddess, and a big bad creator dad.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:35.640
Oh! Stan, could you just make a note to trademark "Angry Mother Goddess" and "Big Bad Creator Dad?"

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.060
Band name, game series, sandwich menu items; the possibilities are endless.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:47.460
In the beginning of the Enuma Elish, the primordial freshwater, Apsû, and the primordial saltwater, Tiamat, "get together," if you catch my drift.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.900
And produce the land, in the form of silt deposits Lahmu and Lahamu.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.740
The land then got together, and created the first family of gods: Anshar, Kishar, and their son Anu

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.360
Who then created a second set of deities, lead by Ea, not to be confused with the Greek Eos, which means "dawn."

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:09.960
Ea and his brothers were a WILD bunch of crazy kids who disturbed their grandparents, Apsû and Tiamat.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.480
Before Apsû could carry out his plan to force Ea and his brothers to "turn down their music and go to their rooms!"

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.640
Ea and Koh[?] killed Apsû. Which does seem a little extreme.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:29.600
Unsurprisingly, Tiamat was... none too happy, so she created a bunch of snakes, dragons, fishmen, bullmen, and other horrors to teach those boys a lesson.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:36.420
Ea, Anshar, and Anu went to war against the monsters, but were unable to defeat them without the help of Ea's son, Marduk

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:44.760
Now, Marduk, whom Ea called the Great Sun (with a U), was no dummy, and he saw his father's weakness as a chance to take over.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:52.560
So he made a deal with Ea. Marduk would help defeat Tiamat if he could be named King of the Gods and, also, the Universe.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:59.480
Ea agreed to Marduk's deal, and he went off to fight Tiamat, who, as sometimes happens, had transformed herself into a sea monster.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.040
We made it! We made it to sea monsters.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.000
Anyway, you probably know where this is going. Marduk defeated Tiamat, and became the king of the gods.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But, hey, surprise ending: Marduk took Tiamat and divided her like a shellfish, to create the world.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.520
Like weeding. And estate planning. Gods hate that stuff!

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:46.560
So, once again we see that a parent is divided up to create the physical world.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.360
Often, this division is described as a sacrifice, and used to explain sacrifice rituals that we find in many religions

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:59.280
Now, are these myths just a way of justifying existing religious rituals, or is there something else going on here?

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:07.320
Maybe these myths have a psychological dimension too. They illustrate the willingness parents may have to sacrifice ANYTHING for their children.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:13.640
But also, some of the messy, complicated, angry feelings that parents can feel towards their kids, and that kids can feel towards their parents.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.180
Though, thankfully, that usually doesn't result in castration.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:24.200
These myths show us that these feelings are as old as, and are even maybe the source of, creation itself.

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.060
Thanks for watching! We'll see you next week.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.320

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.140
Hecatoncheiries!

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:56.220
People say they're ugly, but they sure sound great.
