00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.690
I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse Mythology
and today we’re going to lay mythology down

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.759
on this comfy little couch over here and listen
to all its problems.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.450
It’s time to get all psychology on mythology.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.220
We’ll be examining the theories of both
Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, and discussing

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.640
the curious relationship the works of both
men have to mythology.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.750
So, Thoth, how do you feel about your mother?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.550
OH, that’s right - you created your self.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.850
Or did you spring from Set’s forehead?

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.160
Or was it Ra’s heart?

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.070
ANYWAY - we’re talking about Freud and Jung
for two main reasons.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.230
The first is that they used myths in their
practice.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.440
They relied on ancient stories to describe
the contemporary psychological conditions

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.190
they observed and would often relate what
their patients told them to mythological stories.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.460
And the second is that we can use some of
their theories to explore and analyze myth

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.710
itself, just like we applied Joseph Campbell’s
theories in our exploration of hero myths.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.660
And let’s not forget that Campbell’s theories
owe a lot to Jung.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.950
[[[Thoth holding up a sign that says Forever
Jung?]]]

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.950
Rod Stewart gag, huh?

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:11.650
You been hanging out with Stan too much, my
dude.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.190
INTRO
Freud and Jung were contemporaries and the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.820
two of them were hugely influential in establishing
psychology and psychoanalysis in the 20th

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.820
century.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.290
Freud started writing in the 1890s, and is
generally considered the father of psychoanalysis,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.790
which in turn, has influenced almost all of
our pop culture representations of what psychology

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.630
or therapy or even THE MIND look like.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.250
Freud and Jung both believed that our dreams
-- the stories our minds create without our

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.890
active input -- were keys to understanding
our waking selves and the problems we experienced.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.350
For a lot of his career, Freud thought that
most of our problems had a single root: The

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.350
Oedipus.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.510
You’ve probably heard the phrase “oedipal
complex.”

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.400
This is a classic, and well known, example
of how Freud was influenced by mythology.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.850
He used the Greek myth of Oedipus to help
illustrate a particular theory he had about

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.900
why so many rich 19th-century Viennese people
were so neurotic.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.070
We’ve covered the myth in Crash Course Literature,
but basically: Oedipus is a Greek prince who’s

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.510
the subject of a prophecy which says one day
he will kill his father and marry his mother.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.200
He does everything he can to avoid this, only
years later, to sort of accidentally kill

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.640
his father, the king Laius, and sort of accidentally
marry his mother, the queen Jocasta.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.580
And less accidentally sort of have a bunch
of incest kids.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.870
Freud borrowed Oedipus’ name to help explain
his theory that young boys have a natural

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.570
desire to replace their fathers and bed their
mothers.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.120
Freud argued that so many other hang-ups and
emotions derive from this “complex.”

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.379
Now, maybe you’re thinking: I don’t want
to sleep with my mother, or, I’m not a boy,

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.730
so how does this apply to me?

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.480
And you would be right to have those questions.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.420
There are definitely… assumptions in some
of Freud’s theories.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.370
But like it or not, those theories have shaped
and influenced huge swaths of twentieth century

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.370
western culture.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.540
And we haven’t even talked about his theory
of penis envy.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.709
And--ooh, look at the time, better keep moving.

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.650
Carl Gustav Jung was, at one time, Freud’s
friend and collaborator.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.150
And like Freud, Jung is a towering figure
in the history of psychology.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.840
One of his best-known techniques was a way
of analyzing dreams.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.900
Jung believed that dreams could be understood
through “archetypes.”

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.030
He defined archetypes as those figures or
concepts that occur across cultures and history,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.030
shared, in essence amongst all people.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.750
“There are as many archetypes as there are
typical situations in life,” he once wrote.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.420
Jung believed Archetypes helped us understand
the world, and explain not only our dreams,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.519
but also the common aspects of dreams among
many people.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.629
According to Jung, human beings everywhere
are born with the ability to draw archetypes

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:02.020
from a sort of super-psychic aether, and form
them into an individually useful language

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.470
of storytelling and meaning.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.340
This aether is known as the “collective
unconscious,” and is one potential explanation

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.530
for why there are so many commonalities in
myths throughout the world.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.269
Jung thought archetypes, in dreams and stories
alike, were one key to better understanding

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.099
our own lives.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:28.229
If Jung used archetypes as a way to analyze
dreams, he drew on myths depicted in stories

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.009
and art to figure out what those archetypes
were.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.089
Stories of heroes and witches and tricksters
and maidens help inform the archetypes that

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:41.699
Jung established, which he in turn used to
explore the psychology of his patients.

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:47.069
He considered a person’s psyche to be an
individual manifestation of elements taken

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.939
from the collective unconscious, elements
also often found in myth.

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.879
By taking ideas from different myths, and
using their widely accepted meaning to look

00:04:54.879 --> 00:05:00.159
analytically at our dreams, we can better
understand our own psyche.

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:05.909
And if we want to, we can also plug some of
Jung’s ideas back into myths to better understand

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:06.909
how they work.

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:12.099
Jung discussed a lot of archetypes, but we’re
going to focus on three big ones he thought

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.199
were part of every individual.

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:21.249
If an individual, or a hero of myth, can integrate
them all successfully it means a fusion between

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:27.080
the conscious mind, the personal unconscious
AND the collective unconscious.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.120
That means--wait for it--an integrated self!

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.189
Got it?

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:37.050
And hey, fun bonus fact: this individuation
isn’t necessarily an end state; people can

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.169
go through it numerous times.

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.919
The three archetypes we’re looking at are
the shadow, anima/animus, and the self.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:50.110
The shadow is a part of our unconscious mind
and represents all the parts of a person they

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:51.930
don’t like to acknowledge.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:58.039
This includes less socially acceptable emotions
like rage or sexual desire or survival instincts.[1]

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.379
Think of it as your hidden side.

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.559
Sort of like a reverse image of your conscious
self.

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.399
In dreams and myths, though, the shadow is
always the same gender as the protagonist

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.399
or dreamer.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:13.619
And yeah, Jung has a tendency to break things
down along gender lines and make a lot of

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:15.949
assumptions based on those.

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.180
Today this can feel anachronistic.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.580
And pretty patriarchal.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.819
Something to keep in mind while we learn about
it.

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:27.349
Next, the anima or animus: archetypes that
likewise comprise an aspect of the protagonist’s

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:29.929
self in their unconscious mind.

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:34.800
Women have an animus, which represents their
male side while men have an anima representing

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.460
their female side.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:43.069
Both are aspects of the collective unconscious–avatars
for gender essentialism, kind of.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:48.090
Jung didn’t consider them artifacts of our
specific relationships with family members

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.199
of the opposite sex though, which CAN have
an impact on us, but in a different way.

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:57.860
The anima and -mus, rather, represent a sort
of negation more even deeply held than what

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.569
is represented by our SHADOW.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:08.439
For men, their anima personifies their “feminine”
characteristics like moodiness, intuition,

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:09.879
and irrationality.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:13.649
YEESH - because obviously men are never irrational
or moody.

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:20.509
For women, the animus represents “male”
qualities like aggression, ferocity, risk-taking,

00:07:20.509 --> 00:07:26.139
and according to one scholar of Jung, “silent,
obstinate, evil ideas.”[2] Though, the animus,

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:31.090
they say, can also help women take action,
speak out and find wisdom.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:35.240
Because ladies… need a lot of help with
that kind of thing, right?

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.240
ALSO YEESH.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.169
The last archetype is the Self.

00:07:38.169 --> 00:07:45.149
Not like, your actual self, but a character
that represents a total and timeless unification

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:47.979
of your conscious and unconscious parts.

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:52.839
So sort of a superego, but also your link
to the collective unconscious, too.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.779
The Self does a lot of work.

00:07:54.779 --> 00:07:58.839
The Self will once again be the same gender
as the, uh, self?

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:03.569
Typically, it’s a wise old man, sometimes
called a senex, for men.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:07.409
And for women, a crone, although that term
isn’t as judgy as it sounds.

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:12.899
Having integrated our primitive self, represented
by the shadow, and our emotional opposite,

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:17.689
represented by the anima or animus, we have
gained a greater awareness of ourselves and

00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:20.789
of our participation in the collective unconscious.

00:08:20.789 --> 00:08:25.479
The integration and awareness that the Self
represents is the point of the journey, whether

00:08:25.479 --> 00:08:28.569
it’s a mythical journey or a psychological
one.

00:08:28.569 --> 00:08:33.349
Once the hero–having passed all their psychic
trials–can accept and acknowledge the archetype

00:08:33.349 --> 00:08:37.219
of the self, he or she has gained a kind of
maturity.

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:41.329
And the same could be true for each of us
in the journey of our own lives.

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:45.890
Jungian archetypes can seem [DRAMATIC PAUSE]
abstract.

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:51.009
To make them feel more concrete, let’s use
them to retell a contemporary myth almost

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.490
all of us know: Star Wars!

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.629
Take it away, Thoughtbubble.

00:08:53.629 --> 00:09:00.680
A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away
lived a young dreamer named Luke Skywalker.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:07.250
He begins his process of individuation in
total boredom on a desolate planet devoid

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.470
of meaning.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:14.360
Then, into his life comes a Shadow, with an
awesome black cloak: Darth Vader.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:21.050
Powerful and cruel, Darth Vader could be seen
as representing the harsher, angrier, more

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:27.180
animalistic emotions that Luke will not let
himself express.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:34.480
Not long after, Luke meets another Shadow
in a dangerous bar.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:40.730
This Shadow, named Han, is cocky where Luke
is unassuming, skilled at fighting where Luke

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:46.079
is a novice, and above all worldly, where
Luke is naïve.

00:09:46.079 --> 00:09:51.050
Luke and Han don’t get along at first; in
fact Luke finds many aspects of Han unpleasant,

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.250
especially his selfishness.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:59.740
But eventually the two come to respect each
other, mainly once Luke acknowledges his own

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.480
aggression and learns to control it.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:06.899
Soon Luke finds his Anima in the form of a
powerful princess with rad hair.

00:10:06.899 --> 00:10:11.170
Initially, Princess Leia is an object of sexual
desire for the young man.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:16.230
But she’s also a guide, providing Luke with
the motivation to leave his home.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.440
And she leads him to his Senex: Obi Wan Kenobi.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:26.040
Obi Wan helps Luke reconcile with his Anima,
establishing a loving relationship with her.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:31.550
Later, an even more powerful Senex, Yoda,
the small green Jedi Master with odd sentence

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.170
structure, he meets.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:39.480
Both Senexes, teach Luke the ways of the Force,
an elemental power that pervades all places

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.040
and all things.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:46.130
Once Luke can acknowledge the shadow as a
hidden part of himself, accept the anima as

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:52.889
his opposite self, and accept the wisdom of
the Senex in forming his Self self, only then

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:57.550
does he achieve maturation - by becoming a
JEDI.

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:58.550
Thanks Thoughtbubble.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.699
Who knew Jung was so applicable to outer space?

00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:03.290
Well, George Lucas did.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.089
Because as we mentioned in our first episode
on the hero myth, Jung was a big influence

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:11.459
on Joseph Campbell who was a huge influence
on George Lucas.

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:15.139
Obviously the Star Wars movies are famous
for lots of reasons, but maybe we can attribute

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:20.509
some of their success to their ability to
tap into something we all share - something

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:22.850
in the collective unconscious.

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:28.579
In Luke Skywalker’s transformation from
a whiny little boy to a confident Jedi, maybe

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:32.269
we’re able to recognize our own experience
of growing up.

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:33.850
Though with more robots.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:34.850
Probably.

00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:39.290
They’re not always perfect, but if we use
Jung’s tools as a starting place to analyze

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:44.050
myths, and other popular stories, we can start
to see some of the deep structures that run

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.480
from one to the next.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.079
Maybe we can also start to understand why
certain myths endure and why these are stories

00:11:51.079 --> 00:11:53.040
we want to keep telling.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.740
About our world.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.110
About ourselves.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.110
About our droids.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.029
Next time we wrap up crash course mythology
by taking a look at how the language of myth

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:05.149
has found its way into everyday speech!

00:12:05.149 --> 00:12:06.441
Thanks for watching - see you then!

00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:07.441
Crash Course Mythology is filmed in the Chad
and Stacey Emigholz studio in Indianapolis,

00:12:07.441 --> 00:12:08.441
IN, and is produced with the help of all these
nice people.

00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:09.441
Our animation team is Thought Café.

00:12:09.441 --> 00:12:10.441
Crash Course exists thanks to the generous
support of our patrons at Patreon.

00:12:10.441 --> 00:12:11.441
Patreon is a voluntary subscription service
where you can support the content you love

00:12:11.441 --> 00:12:15.470
through a monthly donation, and help keep
Crash Course free, for everyone, forever.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:25.540
Thanks for watching, and sorry we are if Star
Wars we spoiled.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:32.240
