00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology and

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.860
today we continue our discussion of heroes and

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.480
heroism. This time we are looking at a hero king.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.700
Rama, whose story is told in one of the core texts

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.720
of the Hindu tradition. That's right we're discussing a living

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.360
religious tradition, Thoth and I would like to

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:20.015
remind you that we'll be focusing on the narrative and cultural

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:22.825
aspects of Rama's story rather than its religious meaning

00:00:22.825 --> 00:00:25.885
or potential historical truth.  Also, a quick

00:00:25.885 --> 00:00:28.460
note on pronunciation. There aren't any Sanskrit

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.200
scholars around Crash Course HQ, so we're going to do our best

00:00:31.205 --> 00:00:34.220
but I can guarantee that I'm not going to be perfect.

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:37.320
We've put the sources we used for pronunciations in the doobleedoo

00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:40.275
if you're curious how we arrived at any of what I'm

00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:43.315
attempting to say. Thank you in advance for all of your

00:00:43.315 --> 00:00:46.295
kind and helpful comments. So, who is this

00:00:46.295 --> 00:00:49.295
Rama anyway?  Rama is an avatar of the God Vishnu.

00:00:49.295 --> 00:00:52.025
He's brave, philosophical, and really

00:00:52.025 --> 00:00:55.500
good at archery, and also blue  which is very classy.  OH!

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.420
Very fashionable, Thoth

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.835
The story of the hero King Rama comes from an epic

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:12.085
poem known as the RAMAYANA. Like many other stories

00:01:12.085 --> 00:01:15.165
of antiquity, this one started as an oral tradition

00:01:15.165 --> 00:01:18.000
and was only written down later so there are a number

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.560
of different versions.  Today we're mostly

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.715
referencing the version recorded by the Poet Valmiki

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:29.425
between 400 and 200 B.C.E. when the story was already at least 300

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:31.725
years old. We'll talk about the

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:34.835
significance of this myth to the Hindu tradition but not all

00:01:34.835 --> 00:01:37.735
versions of Rama's story are Hindu

00:01:37.735 --> 00:01:40.615
He shows up in Buddhist mythology too. It's also worth noting

00:01:40.615 --> 00:01:43.195
that there's some debate over how well this story represents

00:01:43.195 --> 00:01:46.255
Hindu culture, values, and principles generally

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:49.245
We're not going to do the same hero's journey blow by blow

00:01:49.245 --> 00:01:52.405
as we did with Gilgamesh but you definitely find plenty of those

00:01:52.405 --> 00:01:55.335
archetypal seeds.  SPOILER ALERT, there's

00:01:55.335 --> 00:01:58.385
at least 5 instances of supernatural aid, some of it

00:01:58.385 --> 00:02:01.605
from monkeys and we are going to come back to Campbell later

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:04.480
to ask "Who really is the hero

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.620
of the RAMAYANA?"  Keep that question in mind . Our version of the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.200
RAMAYANA is a truncated version from thury and definies

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.255
introduction to mythologies textbook.  We start our story

00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.235
right at the beginning, from Rama's birth. His family

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.700
is really important, and there are lots of them.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.000
So, it actually might not hurt to take notes. You got a pen? No? It's OK,  I'll wait.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.600
Okay, ready? Let's do this.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.040
Rama is born the son of the Dasartha, the king of Kosala.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.875
He has an auspicious birth. The first of four sons,

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:37.905
after a long period of kingly

00:02:37.905 --> 00:02:40.915
infertility. And the king has three principle wives:

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:43.945
Kausalya, Rama's mama, Kaikeyi, who

00:02:43.945 --> 00:02:45.885
gives birth to Rama's brother

00:02:45.955 --> 00:02:48.825
Bharata, and Sumitra who has twins, Lakshmana

00:02:48.825 --> 00:02:51.955
and Satrughna. All four princes are

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:55.195
very princely. Smart, polite, they look real sharp in fancy dress,

00:02:55.235 --> 00:02:58.505
but Rama is clearly the princeliest. One day

00:02:58.505 --> 00:03:01.585
day the sage of the Vishvamitra comes looking for help dealing

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:04.665
with the Rakshasas a group of demons, who were just

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.445
genuinely bad news. Rama, who was old enough to do

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:10.435
something about it, pledges to help Vishvamitra.

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:13.505
He and his brother Lakshmana, assist Vishvamitra in an important

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.545
sacrifice first, though. Earning top marks for both

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:19.605
piety and general heroic character. Afterwards,

00:03:19.605 --> 00:03:22.335
Vishvamitra takes Rama and Lakshmana to a neighboring

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:25.255
kingdom, where they meet beautiful princess Sita.

00:03:25.255 --> 00:03:28.265
Her father, the king, had promised Sita's hand

00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:31.065
in marriage, to any man who can who can string

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:34.035
Shiva's bow, and no! that is not

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.975
a euphemism. Shiva has an incredible,

00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:39.105
divine, massive,

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:42.475
bow, for arrows. So,

00:03:42.475 --> 00:03:45.595
here's where Rama really distinguishes himself. He not only

00:03:45.595 --> 00:03:48.595
strings the bow, he draws it with so much

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:51.625
force, that it breaks apart in his hands.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:54.535
The king is satisfied, Rama and Sita are married.

00:03:54.535 --> 00:03:57.675
Twelve years later, Dasartha decides to give up his

00:03:57.675 --> 00:04:00.575
throne, and names Rama as successor.

00:04:00.575 --> 00:04:03.505
In a moment of familial, political intrigue, tho.

00:04:03.505 --> 00:04:06.395
Manthara, the maid servant to queen Kaikeyi,

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.415
convinces her that her son Bharata, Rama's

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.815
younger brother would be a better king.

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:13.545
Kaikeyi goes to Dasartha, and

00:04:13.545 --> 00:04:16.525
begs him to fulfill the promise he made years before.

00:04:16.535 --> 00:04:19.085
Dasartha resists at first, but is stuck

00:04:19.085 --> 00:04:22.125
between his commitment. He makes Bharata king,

00:04:22.125 --> 00:04:24.875
and banishes Rama to the forest, for

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:27.775
fourteen years. Rama, Sita and

00:04:27.775 --> 00:04:30.575
Lakshmana, the loyal brother, head out together

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.565
in exile. The trio go to the Dandaka forest, where

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:36.415
over the next ten years, they adventure like,

00:04:36.415 --> 00:04:39.105
woah! The defeat a demon named Viradha,

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.160
they visit a hermitage, they receive a magical bow, and

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.140
quiver with infinite arrows from the sage Agasthya Rama.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.280
They even make friends with a celestial eagle named Jatayu.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.620
who promises to watch over Sita,

00:04:50.625 --> 00:04:53.765
whenever the two brothers go out hunting. Sadly,

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:56.775
the peace doesn't last. The Rashasa's learn of

00:04:56.775 --> 00:04:59.295
Rama's exile in the Dandaka and send a fourteen

00:04:59.295 --> 00:05:02.245
thousand-strong army after him.

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:04.905
Rama, armed with his magic bow,

00:05:04.905 --> 00:05:07.965
defeats them all. In the face of such an upset, the demon

00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.875
Ravana, who has ten heads, resolves

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:13.765
to get back at Rama. The weakness he can exploit?

00:05:15.055 --> 00:05:17.425
Sita. Ravana orders the demon Maricha

00:05:17.425 --> 00:05:20.515
to change into a beautiful golden deer,

00:05:20.555 --> 00:05:23.505
and prance through the forest. When Sita sees it

00:05:23.505 --> 00:05:26.325
she is entranced, so Rama and Lakshmana

00:05:26.325 --> 00:05:29.465
go out to catch it. With Sita alone, Ravana

00:05:29.465 --> 00:05:32.575
shows up disguised as a hermit. He proposes

00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:35.825
marriage to Sita, who refuses.

00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:38.785
Dadoy. Ravana then reveals his true

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:41.405
form and swipes her, carrying her off

00:05:41.405 --> 00:05:42.695
in his flying chariot

00:05:43.075 --> 00:05:46.105
all Sita can do as she struggles is drop bits of her jewellery

00:05:46.105 --> 00:05:49.005
to a group of monkeys in the trees below

00:05:49.005 --> 00:05:52.045
Hoping that Rama will figure out what has happened. Back in the forest

00:05:52.045 --> 00:05:55.135
Rama kills the golden deer and returns to find

00:05:55.135 --> 00:05:58.195
Sita gone. He and Lakshmana discover the wounded

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.060
Jatayu, who relates the whole story before...

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.820
expiring. Swearing to rescue Sita,

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.760
the two travel to seek out Ravana' lair. Their search

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.560
brings them to The Monkey Kingdom, where they meet

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.540
Sugriv, the Monkey King. At first

00:06:12.545 --> 00:06:15.495
Sugriv mistrusts the two humans, but after

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.515
reassurance from his Chief councillor Hanuman, he decides to give them a

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.020
chance.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.405
So Rama does what he does best. Boss

00:06:21.405 --> 00:06:24.440
archery feats and Sugriv is so impressed that

00:06:24.445 --> 00:06:27.455
they all become friends. The monkeys are happy to help Rama

00:06:27.455 --> 00:06:30.525
rescue Sita but there's one problem: it's monsoon season

00:06:30.525 --> 00:06:33.505
which makes travel very difficult. While he waits

00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:36.480
Rama pines away for his missing wife

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.500
Finally, as the rains abate, Hanuman talks to Jatayu's

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.580
brother, the vulture Sampati and learns that Sita is being

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:45.575
held in Lanka, far across the sea

00:06:45.575 --> 00:06:48.595
guarded by a group of titans and it just

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.515
so happens that Hanuman isn't any old monkey

00:06:51.515 --> 00:06:54.325
but the Son of the Wind. So

00:06:54.325 --> 00:06:57.285
he agrees to fly across the ocean and help

00:06:57.285 --> 00:07:00.305
locate Sita. Hanuman arrives in Lanka only

00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:03.205
to discover a grief stricken woman in ragged

00:07:03.205 --> 00:07:06.635
clothes sitting beneath a tree in the Ashoka garden

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.500
It's Sita. He watches as Ravana enters

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.160
the garden and tries to convince her to marry him.

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.095
Sita rebuffs him yet again and he flies

00:07:15.095 --> 00:07:18.125
into a rage, saying she has two months to change her

00:07:18.125 --> 00:07:21.115
mind or he'll slice her up, cook her

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.120
and eat her.

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.340
This brings us to the Thought Bubble

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.360
After Ravana makes

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.420
his threat and leaves, Sita is stricken with grief

00:07:28.425 --> 00:07:31.385
Her thoughts turn to suicide but at this exact

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:34.305
moment, Hanuman steps from his hiding

00:07:34.305 --> 00:07:37.095
place. He tells Sita he brings Rama's good wishes

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.120
but Sita baulks. What If this is Ravana

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.460
in yet another disguise trying

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:43.035
to trick her

00:07:43.035 --> 00:07:45.995
Hanuman proves who he is by presenting Rama's

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
signet ring

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.120
and offers Sita escape but Sita refuses

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.260
It's only proper that Rama be the one to rescue her

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.160
Hanuman flies back to Rama with this news

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.275
Rama is overjoyed to learn that his wife is safe

00:07:59.275 --> 00:08:02.675
So, he leads a monkey army  across the sea to Lanka

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.900
They battle Ravana's forces for several days

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.775
The struggle is dire. In the end it

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.960
all comes down  to Rama's awesome archery expertise

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.980
He finally slays Ravana ending the skirmish

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.300
Sounds like a happy ending, right? Well,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.120
not exactly

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:21.015
when Rama sees Sita, he says "I have

00:08:21.015 --> 00:08:24.085
defeated my enemy annd avenged the insult to me.

00:08:24.085 --> 00:08:27.095
This campaign was not undertaken wholly for

00:08:27.095 --> 00:08:29.445
your sake; It was to uphold the honor

00:08:29.445 --> 00:08:32.345
of my illustrious family. Your very sight

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:34.805
is now painful to me. For

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:37.615
no man of honor can take back a beautiful woman

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:40.720
who lived for a year in the house

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.725
of a titan. But Sita is undaunted. To

00:08:43.725 --> 00:08:46.635
prove her faithfulness to Rama during captivity, she says

00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:49.545
she will undergo a fire ordeal

00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:51.620
She has Lakshmana raise a pire

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.380
and enters the flames

00:08:53.745 --> 00:08:56.415
She is immediately taken up by the fire

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.535
god, unscathed, thus proving her purity

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.465
beyond the fire cast shadow of

00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:05.820
Thank You! Thought Bubble.. Rama accepts Sita

00:09:05.985 --> 00:09:08.995
 

00:09:08.995 --> 00:09:12.025
 

00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:14.885
 

00:09:14.885 --> 00:09:18.075
 

00:09:18.075 --> 00:09:20.855
 

00:09:20.855 --> 00:09:23.935
 

00:09:23.935 --> 00:09:26.765
 

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:29.735
 

00:09:29.735 --> 00:09:32.735
 

00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:35.825
 

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.635
 

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:41.655
