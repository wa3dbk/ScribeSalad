00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.180
Hi there, I’m Mike Rugnetta, this is Crashcourse
Mythology and today is the first of a few

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.410
episodes focused on one of the greatest aspects
of myths-in-general: Mythical cvreatures.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.170
More specifically: monsters.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.980
And today: one, terrible, international monster
in particular.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.040
But don’t worry Thoth, I’ll protect you.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.930
Uuhh… as long as you also promise to protect
me.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.930
HEY!

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.250
WHERE YOU GOING?

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.170
NO WE DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT ‘SPLIT UP TO
COVER MORE GROUND’

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:36.879
INTRO
What do we mean by the word “monster”?

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:38.749
Well, quite a lot!

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:43.039
In English we use “monster” to describe
something or someone outside the bounds of

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:45.670
acceptable form or behavior.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.309
Monster comes from the Latin word that means
“to show,” and we see its root in words

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.780
like demonstrate.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.579
But, monsters don’t just act monstrously,
their monstrosity is usually pretty visible

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.909
without much action.

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:04.110
Almost any mythical creature could technically
qualify as a monster, but from our studies

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.780
you probably get a sense it’s trickier than
that.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.010
Unicorns, for instance, are way outside normal
appearance and behavior... but no one calls

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.010
them monsters.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.590
The sphinx provides another way to think through
this.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.830
There are actually a number of sphinxes – but
most applicable here are the Egyptian Androsphinxes,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.420
with a male head... like the Great Sphinx
at Giza, and the Greek Sphinx, with a female

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.420
head.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.060
The Egyptian Sphinx was mighty, and powerful
- but mostly considered benevolent, guarding

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.670
entrances to temples and pyramids.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.430
While the Greek Sphinx was considered FEROCIOUS
… and would mercilessly eat those who were

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.890
not able to answer her riddle.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.560
So we might ask - in that duo - which is the
creature? and which… is the monst er?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.940
Beyond some naturalistic boundary, to get
labeled a “monster,” a mythical creature

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.600
usually has to transgress some kind of social
boundary, as well.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.870
If you consider it from a psychological perspective,
particular brands of monstrosity often embody

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.070
particular human fears.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.709
Shapeshifters aren’t automatically “monstrous”
simply because they change forms–think of

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.849
Professor McGonagall, or even The Doctor–but
because often that ability can be used to

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.580
DECEIVE–think Mystique–or lead to UNCONTROLLABLE
URGES, like with werewolves.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.410
Vampires are another example: they may be
a human-bat combo… but that’s not REALLY

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.800
why they’re monstrous.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.420
Vampires are bad because of their thirst for
human blood - which is a pretty serious transgression

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.530
of social norms.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.409
Often some naturalistic transgression is simply
an outward sign of what makes monsters TRULY

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.410
evil: what anthropology professor David Gilmore
calls, an “unmotivated wickedness towards

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.410
humans.”

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.310
This can take ... different forms.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.430
The most common version is: monsters eat people.

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.269
But sometimes that wickedness is more complicated,
and has more to do with the person who is

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.819
afraid than the thing doing the scaring.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:01.090
But why do monsters even exist?

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.430
Well, lots of reasons!

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.540
Monsters are often sent by gods to punish
humans for some transgression.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.859
One of the most common images of a monster
in western art for example, is the sea monster

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.019
sent by Poseidon to devour Andromeda.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.019
Why?

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.579
Because her mother Cassiopeia had bragged
that she was more beautiful than the Nereids.

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.219
Humans, just... don’t brag when gods are
around.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.969
It never goes well.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.480
Luckily, Andromeda was saved by Perseus.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.640
And hey, that’s another reason to have some
monsters around: you gotta give heroes something

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.640
to fight!

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.450
Our friend Joseph Campbell, among otshers,
has identified the basic pattern of hero vs

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.450
monster stories.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.310
It’s a three-part, repetitive cycle where
the monster mysteriously appears from a dark

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.390
shadow world to menace some previously-peaceful
locale.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.999
After the monster brings death and destruction,
the besieged community calls upon a hero who

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.999
saves them.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:59.300
The community rejoices, only to have the monster,
or one of the monster’s kin, return and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.300
re-start the cycle.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.109
A classic example of this is Beowulf.

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.779
Grendel shows up, Beowulf defeats him, and
just when he thinks he’s all done, Grendel’s

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:10.050
MOM shows up, and Beowulf has to get all heroic
all over again.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.059
Today, however, we have a monster even more
terrifying than Grendel’s super mad momma.

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.060
This incredibly frightening monster comes
from…

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.060
Canada.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.859
Sorry, Thoughtbubble: this one’s for you,
eh.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.240
Once upon a time in the late 19th century,
a first nations group is living in a camp

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.500
on the Berens River.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.030
One day, a hunter is driven by hunger and
leaves camp to go trapping.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.199
A few days later, people in the camp hear
the trapper screaming and howling in the woods.

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.539
Everyone knows what’s happening.

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.440
The trapper has become a Wendigo, a terrifying,
man-eating ogre.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.440
But wait.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.440
It gets worse.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.440
A brave group goes to look for the trapper
and find his family, all dead.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.169
And hey, worse still, half eaten.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.530
They return and tell their story, and panic
runs through the camp.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:05.060
The people know that soon the Wendigo will
come for them, and they don’t feel like

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.060
being eaten.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.240
So they call a council.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.670
At the council an intrepid young warrior named
Rotten Log stands up and volunteers to fight

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.670
the Wendigo.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.630
That night they go to the forest and build
a fire.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.490
Sure enough, a huge monster arrives, This…
is almost certainly the Wendigo.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:30.440
The Wendigo attacks Rotten Log, trying to
slash his throat and eat him, but Rotten Log

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.080
has a guardian spirit he calls on to save
him.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.139
The spirit gives Rotten Log supernatural strength,
and after a long battle, he finally defeats

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:42.139
the Wendigo.

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.780
The hunters bring the creature back to the
camp and the people rejoice.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.780
But the Wendigo isn’t dead.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.789
Not yet.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.580
The only way to kill a Wendigo is to melt
its icy heart.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.860
So the peoplethrow him on a raging fire.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.970
The flames heat the beast, his heart defrosts,
and the Wendigo finally dies.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.120
Thank you Thoughtbubble.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.780
Yeah, as far as ogres go, I think I prefer
Shrek.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.080
As I mentioned that this story was from Canada,
but there are countless others.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.889
According to Gilmore, the Wendigo has the
distinction of being the monster whose mythology

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:19.080
has the greatest geographical reach in the
world.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.129
Wendigo stories, and the hysteria that accompanies
them, have been reported all across Canada

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:25.710
and as far south as...North Dakota.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.330
They are common among most of the Algonquian-speaking
native tribes, but especially the Ojibwa and

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.600
Salteaux Manitoba.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.870
The Wendigo is, in many ways, the quintessential
monster.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:41.550
It’s big, it has superhuman strength, and
it’s really mean to people.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:45.879
Wendigos are humanoid in appearance, with
two legs, but almost everything else about

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.150
them is misshapen and grotesque.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.770
Their hands are paws with twelve inch long
claws, and their feet, each a yard long, have

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.270
a single toe with one long, sharp nail.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:04.510
Wendigos have huge yellow eyes, like an owl,
and a giant mouth and no lips, because their

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.030
cannibalistic hunger causes them to devour
THEIR own flesh.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.370
Their breath is so powerful and loud that
it seems like a windstorm, and their howling

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.400
sends those who hear it into a panic.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.300
Think you can hide from a Wendigo?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.610
Maybe in the river?

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:20.610
Nope.

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:23.629
They can walk on water or swim beneath it
like a seal.

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:27.979
They can subsist on mushrooms, rotting wood,
moss... basically anything you find on the

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:29.099
forest floor.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:35.569
But their favorite food is people, and THAT…
really, is what makes them MONSTERS.

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:41.030
There are both male and female Wendigos and
when a male and female meet, they fight until

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.759
one of them dies.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:47.509
But … if male and female Wendigos would
rather fight than breed, then where do new

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:48.999
Wendigos come from?

00:07:48.999 --> 00:07:50.590
A monster stork maybe?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:56.560
As the story makes clear, they come from us,
the ranks of the desperate and hungry.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.539
Ordinary humans, often driven by hunger, can
become possessed by the spirit of the Wendigo

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:04.229
and turn to cannibalism.

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:09.800
These metamorphoses are often brought on by
the starvation that can occur in cold winter

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.800
months.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.940
In many of the stories, this Wendigo possession
is accompanied by incredible physical changes.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.800
A person who has “gone Wendigo” will grow
in size and their appearance will become coarse

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800
and wild.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.610
As the Wendigo’s heart freezes, the urge
to eat human flesh grows, eventually becoming

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.610
irresistible.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:35.930
This idea that anyone can transform into a
Wendigo is found in the most typical Wendigo

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:37.579
origin story.

00:08:37.579 --> 00:08:43.139
That very first, ancient Wendigo was a Native
North American who was transformed into a

00:08:43.139 --> 00:08:45.410
monster by overpowering hunger.

00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:50.940
This story is so real to many who hear it
that it has caused actual Wendigo panics in

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.430
Canada up through the twentieth century.

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:58.360
How do we understand the endurance of the
Wendigo legend?

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.990
Well, I think just about all of us can agree
that cannibalism is a pretty terrifying and

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.410
taboo thing.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:11.399
The Wendigo represents a fear of cannibalism
and a fear that we might lose control of ourselves

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:15.490
and violate, perhaps violently, some set of
social norms, like… not eating your neighbor.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:21.510
People usually don’t grow three-foot monster
toes, but they do sometimes lose their grip.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:26.380
Which is to say, the “monster legend”
is alive and well... although maybe more as

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.790
a metaphor than as a real yellow-eyed creature.

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.880
All humans have the capacity to become monstrous.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.610
Even me... and maybe even...

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.610
Thoth.

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:38.610
Thanks for watching.

00:09:38.610 --> 00:10:27.370
We’ll see you next week… unless this guy
sees you first.
