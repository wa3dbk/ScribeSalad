00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.890
Hi there. I'm Mike Rugnetta this is Crash Course Mythology,

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.940
and today we're going to talk about the Holy Grail...

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.840
of Mythology. Which is the actual, literal,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.915
non-metaphorical Holy Grail

00:00:11.915 --> 00:00:14.985
King Arthur, Knights of the Round Table, and most importantly questing.

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.035
The Holy Grail is always just out of reach,

00:00:18.035 --> 00:00:20.985
as the end of the road, ultimate goal

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:23.935
the greatest adventure. And so the Grail quest,

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:26.335
for whoever takes it, is a ready made hero's journey.

00:00:26.665 --> 00:00:29.705
No. Nobody. It's a grail, not a scale.

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:32.505
Close though.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.395
In this video we'll talk about two knights who quested after that pesky grail.

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:38.535
and we'll examine two things. First where's these stories depart

00:00:38.535 --> 00:00:41.435
from Campbell's monomythic pattern

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:43.935
and second, how they combine the values of Christianity

00:00:43.935 --> 00:00:46.715
with the tropes and characters of pre-Christian myths.

00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:49.835
Grab your armor, and your coconut halves

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.815
and let's quest for knowledge.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.735
The legends of King Arthur and his knights had been retold endlessly

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.885
from the Middle Ages trough today.

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.955
Many versions of the story contradict each other, or change focus.

00:01:09.955 --> 00:01:12.495
Historians even disagree over whether there was a real

00:01:12.495 --> 00:01:15.535
living breathing King Arthur.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.415
That doesn't bother us though, because either way

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.385
the body of Arthurian legends remains incredibly influential.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:24.215
Most of the stories that make up Arthurian hero myths

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:27.475
come from the late Medieval period, the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.

00:01:27.475 --> 00:01:30.515
They coalesced in what most of us would recognize as Arthur's Tale

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:38.465
with Merlin, and Lancelot, and Guinevere, and all the rest in in [Sir] Thomas Malory's late 15th century stories collected as "Le Morte D'Arthur"

00:01:38.875 --> 00:01:41.895
However we're going to focus on two other version of the grail story

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:44.765
centered around two other knights,

00:01:44.765 --> 00:01:47.765
Percival and Galahad. To explore this paradigmatic

00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:50.985
legend of England we're gonna start in France

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.725
because the first time the Holy Grail appears

00:01:53.725 --> 00:02:01.985
as part of the Arthurian myth is in Chretien De Troyes, "Story of the Grail," a romance composed between 1181 and 1191 CE.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:04.405
De Troyes not only made his Arthurian tale

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:05.540
about the quest for the elusive grail he also made Percival,

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.655
and not Arthur or any other knight

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:13.595
the hero.  And Percival is maybe not the kind of

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:16.665
knight you're used to.  He's a very brave young

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:19.325
man but, he's not the sharpest lance

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:22.235
in the armory. And it also turns out that his chivalry,

00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:25.185
and naivety play big parts in his

00:02:25.185 --> 00:02:33.945
hero's journey.  When our story begins Percival is living alone with his mom in the Waste Forest which sounds unpleasant, and

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:38.300
almost like a Fallout location. Percival is an only child to a single mom

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.805
because his dad, and all his

00:02:39.805 --> 00:02:41.745
older brothers were killed

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:45.195
serving as knights. Percival's mom never

00:02:45.195 --> 00:02:47.985
tells him this.  She's all he has left

00:02:47.985 --> 00:02:50.915
and she worries that if young, not-so-bright Percy

00:02:50.915 --> 00:02:53.675
learns the truth, he'll want to be a knight and

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.615
he'll get himself killed too.

00:02:56.615 --> 00:02:59.515
Mom's plan works, until one day Percy's out

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:02.765
hunting, and he comes across five glittering figures on horses.

00:03:02.895 --> 00:03:05.915
They are literal knights, in literal shining armor.

00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:07.945
But Percy has no idea what a

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:11.115
knight is, because his mom has shielded him from them.

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:14.175
So he thinks they must be angels.

00:03:14.175 --> 00:03:16.985
Like I said, not the sharpest. Once he realizes

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:20.105
they're not angels Percival starts asking the knights a ton of

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:22.895
questions, like "Whatcha carryin'?"

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:25.895
The knights look at each other like, "It's a lance, dude."

00:03:25.985 --> 00:03:28.845
Eventually one of the knights leans over to his commander and says

00:03:29.165 --> 00:03:31.195
"Sir, you must be aware that all Welshmen

00:03:31.195 --> 00:03:34.105
are by nature more stupid than beasts in the field."

00:03:34.105 --> 00:03:37.105
Percy's not making the best first impression.

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:40.025
Percial runs home and tells his mom

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:42.575
all about the knights. She sees

00:03:42.575 --> 00:03:49.050
the writing on the wall.  She breaks down and she tells him the truth. Your father and your brothers

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.705
were knights and they died because of it.

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:54.595
Percy's eyes light up.

00:03:54.595 --> 00:03:57.115
It doesn't seem like he gets the moral of the story.  He says, literally

00:03:57.115 --> 00:04:03.005
"I don't understand your words, but I would gladly go to the king who makes knights;

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:06.045
and I will go, no matter what.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.925
So off he goes on his quest

00:04:08.925 --> 00:04:11.695
never to see his mother again.  Right out of the gate

00:04:11.695 --> 00:04:14.645
he gets in a fight with a knight, and defeats him in solo battle.

00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:17.705
So, maybe he's got heroic talent after all.  Shortly after

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:20.675
he encounters an old nobleman. In classic

00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:23.685
spiritual adviser fashion the old man teaches Percy a lesson.

00:04:23.685 --> 00:04:26.335
"Don't talk too much

00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:29.445
because you don't want to offend others.

00:04:29.445 --> 00:04:32.075
Percy takes this to heart, and you

00:04:32.075 --> 00:04:34.885
should too.  It's going to come back and bite him.  We're going to continue Percy's

00:04:34.885 --> 00:04:38.075
quest in The Thought Bubble. Percival next meets the Fisher King.

00:04:38.075 --> 00:04:39.715
Who is, you guessed it, a fisher.

00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:43.595
F.K. takes a shine to Percy,

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:46.525
and invites him to a special banquet at his castle.  At dinner

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:49.235
Percy finds out the king has been grievously

00:04:49.235 --> 00:04:52.375
wounded, and is on death's door.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:55.125
None the less the Fisher King, a gracious host,

00:04:55.395 --> 00:04:58.585
presents a sword he claims was destined for Percival.

00:04:58.585 --> 00:05:01.595
Suddenly a progression

00:05:01.595 --> 00:05:04.545
of squires parade in with all of these weird objects.

00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:07.435
First a white lance

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.380
with blood dripping from it's tip. Next, a candelabra. After that a maiden enters

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:15.415
bearing a beautiful grail.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:21.265
Psst... that's the Holy Grail y'all.  Everyone turns, and looks at Percy.  Being the good,

00:05:21.265 --> 00:05:24.215
obedient boy that he is, he remembers the weird old

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:27.425
stranger's advice, and he doesn't say a thing.

00:05:27.745 --> 00:05:30.595
Dinner wraps up, and Percival goes on his way.

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:33.415
Everything seems fine, until he meets a

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:36.505
damsel wailing and cradling the body

00:05:36.505 --> 00:05:39.705
of a headless knight. Percival asks what happened, but

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:42.715
the maiden turns on him.  She asks point blank,

00:05:42.715 --> 00:05:45.755
"Did you say anything about the lance you saw?

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:48.995
Did you ask any questions about the grail?" Percy explains, "Of course not!"

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:51.525
He didn't want to be rude. The woman yells at him.

00:05:52.075 --> 00:05:54.975
"That grail has great power!  If you'd only asked about it,

00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:57.765
just one question,

00:05:57.765 --> 00:06:00.735
the dying king would have been healed."

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:03.765
She further explains "Hey, your mom's dead.  I buried her.

00:06:03.785 --> 00:06:06.865
Also, I'm your cousin. And also, also, you gotta suss out this grail thing.

00:06:06.865 --> 00:06:09.835
I can't help, I got more burying to do.  See ya; wouldn't want to be ya."

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:12.845
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, this is a lot

00:06:12.845 --> 00:06:15.905
to take in.  Getting told off by his cousin though

00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:18.625
is Percival's turning point.  He swears an oath.

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:21.265
He won't rest until he learns what exactly

00:06:21.265 --> 00:06:24.545
the deal with the grail and the bleeding lance is.

00:06:24.675 --> 00:06:27.585
Such is the start of his grail quest, which lasts

00:06:27.585 --> 00:06:30.605
five years.  He has

00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.545
wild adventures, meeting knights, doing battle,

00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:36.740
and even learning a lesson about the meaning of Good Friday. This sets

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.360
up the particularly Christian faith based conclusion

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.995
of this particular tale. Because eventually

00:06:41.995 --> 00:06:45.115
Percival comes across a wise hermit. And after years of

00:06:45.115 --> 00:06:48.185
questing with nothing to show for it, Percy

00:06:48.185 --> 00:06:51.095
confesses his sorrow. It turns out the hermit knows why

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:54.515
Percival has failed.  "Remember your mom?" He asks.

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:58.175
"As soon as you left home she died of grief."

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:00.975
"That sinfulness is why you never asked

00:07:00.975 --> 00:07:04.015
about the lance or grail."

00:07:04.015 --> 00:07:06.785
And the man who was served from the grail? Percival's uncle.

00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:09.255
And the Fisher King?  Percy's cousin!

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:12.205
He's been letting his family down left and right.

00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:15.195
The hermit tells him "You need to do penance."

00:07:15.195 --> 00:07:18.085
"Go to mass. Have faith in G-d. Take

00:07:18.085 --> 00:07:21.245
communion on Easter."  This is where Chretien De Troyes' version of

00:07:21.245 --> 00:07:24.455
the grail story ends, with Percival learning the truth about the grail,

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:26.335
and thereby fulfilling his oath.

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:28.575
You may have noticed all the standard

00:07:28.575 --> 00:07:31.105
features of Campbell's hero's journey.  Auspicious birth, and

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:34.095
hidden parentage, damsels, and father figures, sages

00:07:34.095 --> 00:07:37.055
offering advice. But the grail never becomes the

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:40.085
ultimate boon.  Percy doesn't find it.

00:07:40.085 --> 00:07:42.235
He isn't even really looking for it.

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:45.125
Instead he's looking for knowledge. "Of

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:48.125
the grail!" you may interject, but really about himself,

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:50.865
and the world.  You can also see how Christianity

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:53.745
gets wrapped up in the mythical grail.

00:07:53.745 --> 00:07:56.385
Let's look at another version of this story from the anonymously written

00:07:56.385 --> 00:07:59.135
"Quest of the Holy Grail" A thirteenth century

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:01.765
prose romance.  The story differs from  Chretien's

00:08:01.765 --> 00:08:04.575
in at least two major ways. First, the hero isn't

00:08:04.575 --> 00:08:07.235
Percival, it's Galahad. And second

00:08:07.235 --> 00:08:10.545
while Percival didn't know much about Christianity or

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:13.615
anything for that matter, Galahad is a model

00:08:13.615 --> 00:08:16.465
of Christian virtue, especially chastity.  That's

00:08:16.465 --> 00:08:19.225
important.  This version has an overtly Christian

00:08:19.225 --> 00:08:21.725
morality, connecting the grail to the doctrine

00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:24.335
of transubstantiation, the explaination

00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:27.275
of how bread and wine morphs into Jesus' body

00:08:27.275 --> 00:08:30.385
and blood during communion.  In this story our hero Galahad is

00:08:30.385 --> 00:08:32.855
the son of Lancelot, and Galahad

00:08:32.855 --> 00:08:35.795
is beautiful.  So fair

00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:37.255
and shapely a youth

00:08:37.255 --> 00:08:40.325
that one could hardly find his equal in the world.

00:08:40.355 --> 00:08:43.655
He's also crucially a virtuous virgin, with

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:46.035
no fever of lust in him

00:08:46.035 --> 00:08:49.125
unlike his dad Lancelot. Sleeping with the Queen,

00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:51.725
how disvirtuous.  Galahad's virtue

00:08:51.725 --> 00:08:54.825
marks him out for a special role that he's ushered into

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:58.065
by a spiritual guide. An old man who introduces

00:08:58.065 --> 00:09:00.985
Galahad to Arthur, and the knights of the round

00:09:00.985 --> 00:09:03.945
table. Galahad even gets a special seat

00:09:03.945 --> 00:09:06.885
reserved for the grail knight.

00:09:06.885 --> 00:09:09.495
It's called The Seat of Danger.

00:09:09.495 --> 00:09:12.455
(echoes)

00:09:12.455 --> 00:09:15.465
So Galahad sits in his danger chair, and announces that he'll take up

00:09:15.465 --> 00:09:18.520
the grail quest.  He proves his worthiness first

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.760
by pulling a sword from a stone

00:09:20.765 --> 00:09:23.615
echoing Arthurs miraculous feat with Excalibur,

00:09:23.615 --> 00:09:26.645
and again by defeating all the other knights in a tournament.

00:09:26.645 --> 00:09:29.695
At a celebratory feast the grail appears

00:09:29.695 --> 00:09:32.695
in a vision, and miraculously feeds everyone

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.560
especially hungry, hungry Arthur.  Galahad

00:09:35.705 --> 00:09:38.220
and the other knights have many adventures, but the crucial

00:09:38.225 --> 00:09:41.255
turn comes when Galahad, Percival, and a knight named

00:09:41.255 --> 00:09:44.235
Bors set out on a self sailing

00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:47.275
ship.  The ship takes them to a small island

00:09:47.275 --> 00:09:50.215
where they find a magic sword, and Perceval's sister.

00:09:50.215 --> 00:09:53.175
She says hi to Percy, and explains "This sword is

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:58.795
destined for Galahad.  To complete your quest you must take it to the house of

00:09:58.795 --> 00:10:01.855
the maimed king." Which is harder than it sounds, and

00:10:01.855 --> 00:10:04.895
that's sayin' a lot because it doesn't sound easy.  It takes

00:10:04.895 --> 00:10:07.775
five years of running around

00:10:07.775 --> 00:10:10.745
separating, reuniting, but finally the three

00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:13.655
knights arrive at the castle of the maimed king,

00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:16.855
Castle Corbenic, the castle of the grail.

00:10:16.855 --> 00:10:18.405
And who do they meet inside?

00:10:19.395 --> 00:10:22.595
Jesus.  That is not a joke.  They literally

00:10:22.695 --> 00:10:25.815
meet Jesus, who explains at long last

00:10:25.815 --> 00:10:28.635
the mystery, and significance of the grail.

00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:31.395
 

00:10:31.395 --> 00:10:34.455
 

00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:37.345
 

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:40.715
 

00:10:40.815 --> 00:10:44.095
 

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:47.225
 

00:10:47.225 --> 00:10:49.945
 

00:10:49.945 --> 00:10:53.175
 

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:55.885
 

00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:58.895
 

00:10:58.895 --> 00:11:00.400
 

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.705
With the truth of the grail revealed

00:11:01.705 --> 00:11:04.275
Galahad continues to travel the land embroiled

00:11:04.275 --> 00:11:07.075
in various adventures.  ... However

00:11:07.075 --> 00:11:10.085
Galahad never makes it home to Camalot.

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:12.865
Instead he ends up locked in a

00:11:12.865 --> 00:11:15.825
dungeon, where he eventually dies, and is

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:18.865
miraculously lifted to Heaven.  So it's left to Bors

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:21.455
to cross the threshold back into Camalot

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.020
and to tell everyone the true wonder

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.055
of the grail. Obviously there's more to these

00:11:26.055 --> 00:11:29.005
Arthurian myths than just the quest for the Holy Grail. We haven't even

00:11:29.005 --> 00:11:30.275
mentioned

00:11:30.765 --> 00:11:33.635
the incest, and there's a fair amount of incest.

00:11:33.635 --> 00:11:36.645
Still, the grail myths offer a nice paralell to other hero

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:39.645
myths.  Miraculous feats, magical weapons, spiritual guides,

00:11:39.645 --> 00:11:42.695
and epic road trips.  In the end the quest

00:11:42.695 --> 00:11:44.745
for a particular object gets intertwined

00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:47.745
with the articulation of particular religious and cultural values.

00:11:47.745 --> 00:11:50.295
Just like in the Ramayana, where

00:11:50.295 --> 00:11:53.245
adherence to Dharma is the real heroism.

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:56.155
We might also compare these stories to the Aboriginal tale of The Seven Sisters

00:11:56.155 --> 00:11:59.335
where the quest is one of self improvement

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.395
rather than the pursuit of some external wealth

00:12:02.395 --> 00:12:05.195
or precious object.  For Percival, and Galahad the quest isn't

00:12:05.195 --> 00:12:08.155
about the grail itself, but the grail's meaning.

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:11.265
Perceval isn't seeing a bejeweled golden chalice

00:12:11.265 --> 00:12:14.365
but the answer to a question he should've asked.

00:12:14.435 --> 00:12:17.065
Galahad too finds out the meaning of the grail

00:12:17.065 --> 00:12:19.655
which is what Bors must bring back to

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.645
the round table.  Remember, for Campbell and other scholars

00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:25.345
the hero's journey is a metaphor for any human being's journey

00:12:25.345 --> 00:12:28.315
towards greater understanding of themselves.

00:12:28.315 --> 00:12:30.525
Sure, these knights defeat enemies and save maidens

00:12:30.525 --> 00:12:33.695
and fight with magical swords, but they're heroes because of the

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:36.155
knowledge they gain along the way.

00:12:36.665 --> 00:12:39.525
Which I guess makes you a hero for watching Crash Course.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:42.605
