00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
Hi, I'm Mike Rugnetta, this is Crash Course Mythology, and today

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:05.515
we're finishing up our series on trickster stories

00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:08.715
by looking at two of the most famous and popular

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.955
tricksters of them all, coyote and

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:13.835
raven. There are many individual Native American

00:00:13.835 --> 00:00:16.505
mythological traditions from different tribes

00:00:16.505 --> 00:00:19.065
and in different regions and stories about

00:00:19.065 --> 00:00:21.995
coyotes and ravens as grand tricksters

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:24.935
pop up in tales across the whole continent.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.585
In many locations these animals would have been known for making

00:00:27.585 --> 00:00:28.085
 

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:30.515
off with livestock, or picking at the bodies of dead

00:00:30.515 --> 00:00:31.015
 

00:00:31.015 --> 00:00:34.075
animals. While scavenging isn't exactly clever in the way

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.545
tricksters often are it is sort of...

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:39.735
devious, which explains the wealth of trickster myths

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:43.005
about these two figures. We're gonna focus on a few

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.305
of the best of them. And along the way we'll see that sometimes playing a few tricks

00:00:46.305 --> 00:00:49.175
can really put a twinkle in your eye. Or,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.420
make it pink.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.000
[theme music]

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.535
 

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:02.100
Before I get into the specific myths,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.065
I should explain something

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:06.115
about the content and context of some of these

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:09.145
coyote and raven stories. We've already mentioned that

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:12.445
in many Native American myths, the line between the human world

00:01:12.445 --> 00:01:15.220
and animal world is blurry. Humans live alongside

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.580
mythological animals that help create the world

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.600
and establish important rituals.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660
This handling of mythological animals

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.160
is distinct from say,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.500
the pantheon of gods and monsters that we see

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.340
in Norse, Greek, or egyptian traditions.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.260
Those traditions have myths about animals, it's true.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.220
But they aren't the stars of the show, in the way

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.400
that they are in Native American myths

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.700
I also just want to say, up front that the myths we're about to discuss

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.540
aren't exactly...

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.780
G-rated.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.060
Some scholars have pointed out that many Native American  myths

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.620
feature particularly frank discussions of Sexy-Time

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.640
and the organs that are used to accomplish it.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.460
Thoth, buddy. There's no need to blush.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.420
and also they talk a lot about the elimination of...

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.220
bodily wastes.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.860
so long story short we're going to talk about poop

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.860
One day, Coyote is out walking and he sees some tasty looking, bright red rose-hips

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.295
He's about to gobble them up

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.280
when those rose-hips, that can talk, bt - dubbs,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.900
worn Coyote that, if gobbled

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.400
they're gonna' give him horrible flatulence

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960
But Coyote doesn't listen so

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.080
CHOMP

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.520
And wouldn't you know it, soon Coyote is stumbling around

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.640
doubled over in pain from a rather intense and alarming build-up of gas.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.820
At about this time, Coyote happens across two crows picking over

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.015
a dead buffalo. Devising a plan, Coyote

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:33.135
asks if they want to play a game. Which,

00:02:33.135 --> 00:02:35.885
I mean of course they do! Who doesn't love a game?!

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:38.305
Coyote proposes a contest to see

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:40.300
who can defecate

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.605
from one side of the buffalo to the other. Whoever is able to launch their poop

00:02:44.605 --> 00:02:47.415
over the buffalo, gets to keep it

00:02:47.415 --> 00:02:50.275
and eat it. The buffalo, I mean, not the poop.

00:02:50.275 --> 00:02:52.395
I'm not sure who get's that - anyway, the crows

00:02:52.785 --> 00:02:55.695
think that this is disgusting, and hey, samesies.

00:02:55.695 --> 00:02:58.255
But Coyote is very persuasive

00:02:58.385 --> 00:03:01.415
and the contest begins. The crow goes first.

00:03:01.415 --> 00:03:04.235
He turns around and he poops as hard as he can,

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:07.075
but only manages to "poop - shoot" halfway.

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:10.235
Coyote, now fit to BURST

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.700
with rose hip's gas, turns around,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.195
relaxes, and let's just

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.055
say, he wins the contest - easily.

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:20.925
The crows cannot believe their eyes.

00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:23.925
They beg Coyote to let them have SOME

00:03:23.925 --> 00:03:26.915
of the buffalo meat. In an uncharacteristic bit of trickster compassion,

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.000
Coyote is no Anansi,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.875
He agrees to give them the fat around the eye sockets and the joints

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:34.605
and the ribs,

00:03:35.555 --> 00:03:36.555
*weird groan*

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:39.000
Stan, maybe cancel my lunch order?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.255
OK, according to Lenard McClure, the moral of the story is

00:03:51.195 --> 00:03:53.000
I might say the moral is also don't eat

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.055
rose hips, don't poop competitively, but maybe even with gastrointestinal

00:03:57.055 --> 00:04:00.600
crisis, there can be found... great opportunity?

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.400
At least, if you have your tricky cap on?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.825
Aww, Thoth, is that your tricky cap?

00:04:04.825 --> 00:04:07.545
Looks good. This story also shows an important similarity

00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:10.805
Coyote shares with the tricksters of other mythological traditions.

00:04:10.805 --> 00:04:13.895
He is unable to resist giving in to his outside

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:16.795
hedonistic desires. Remember hungry Hermes

00:04:16.795 --> 00:04:19.725
and greedy Anansi? The entire poop

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:22.685
shot-put is a result of Coyote munching

00:04:22.685 --> 00:04:25.685
down on tasty looking rose hips even though

00:04:25.685 --> 00:04:28.665
he knows it's a bad idea. Not all of Coyote's desires are

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.000
quite so... digestion oriented, of course.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.695
There are a number of stories that involve his sexual appetites.

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:37.605
And in many Native American stories, the trickster's desire for

00:04:37.605 --> 00:04:40.775
sex is interpreted as a mirror for the rest of

00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:43.625
humanity. A recognition that most of us have

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:46.305
similar drives. As our old friends Lenard and McClure

00:04:46.305 --> 00:04:49.355
put it, "...The Native American's

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.355
trickster reminds us like no other that humans, for all their pretensions

00:04:52.355 --> 00:04:55.075
to intellectual and spiritual culture and for

00:04:55.155 --> 00:04:57.885
all their moments of bravery, altruism, and generosity,

00:04:57.885 --> 00:05:00.955
are nevertheless animals ruled by appetites

00:05:00.955 --> 00:05:03.285
and impulses that make them

00:05:03.285 --> 00:05:06.445
equally capable of cowardice, selfishness, and cruelty."

00:05:06.485 --> 00:05:09.175
We're not gonna' focus on

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:12.075
those "sexy" stories, though,

00:05:12.075 --> 00:05:13.525
this is a family friendly series

00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:15.715
Well, except for all the death...

00:05:16.535 --> 00:05:19.535
and the incest, oh, and the castration,

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:22.545
OK - you know what? Let's just move on. Coyote like other tricksters is

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:25.265
creative, and on occasion, even helpful.

00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:27.865
In one story, from the Wasco people of the Pacific Northwest,

00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:31.255
Coyote even helps place stars in the sky.

00:05:31.645 --> 00:05:34.675
Let's go to the Thought Bubble. One day, Coyote sees

00:05:34.675 --> 00:05:37.615
several of his wolf buddies looking up at the sky.

00:05:37.615 --> 00:05:40.675
He asks what their looking at. "Nothing," they tell him.

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:43.475
The next night, they see him looking up at the sky again and asks again

00:05:43.475 --> 00:05:46.145
Finally, the youngest wolf says," ah

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.375
Let's tell 'em, he won't do anything,"

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.000
which, I mean, had they not met Coyote?

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.355
the wolves tell him they are watching two mysterious animals

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.400
up in the sky. Ever curious, Coyote suggests,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.165
" Let's go hang out with them." Coyote starts shooting arrows

00:06:01.165 --> 00:06:04.185
in to the sky and his aim is so good that

00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:07.245
each arrow hits the last one, creating a ladder of

00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:10.445
ladder of arrows from earth to sky. Coyote and the wolves

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.135
climb up the arrow ladder which takes many

00:06:13.135 --> 00:06:16.145
days and nights, but when they finally reach their

00:06:16.145 --> 00:06:18.605
destination, they find that the two animals

00:06:18.605 --> 00:06:19.105
 

00:06:19.105 --> 00:06:21.960
are grizzly bears. Coyote warns the wolves

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.960
to not go near the bears but the two youngest wolves

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.860
walk over and sit down. Then, the two

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.835
next youngest wolves do the same. Finally, seeing

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.840
that it's safe, the oldest wolf goes over, and takes

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.955
a seat. I guess sky bears are pretty chill! Admiring

00:06:36.955 --> 00:06:39.275
the wolves and the bears, Coyote says

00:06:40.035 --> 00:06:42.685
 

00:06:42.685 --> 00:06:45.715
 

00:06:45.715 --> 00:06:48.465
 

00:06:48.465 --> 00:06:51.000
 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.575
So Coyote leaves, taking the arrows with him

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:57.565
as he returns to earth. And from there, he admires

00:06:57.565 --> 00:07:00.615
his handiwork, which you can still see today.

00:07:00.615 --> 00:07:03.045
Four wolves, make up the handle of the Big Dipper

00:07:03.045 --> 00:07:05.500
the youngest two wolves and the bears

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.900
make up its bowl. So I guess Coyote was right! Here we are

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.720
telling his story. Thanks ThoughtBubble

00:07:11.725 --> 00:07:14.960
this story is a great example of the trickster as

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:18.115
creator. The wolves, were probably pretty

00:07:18.115 --> 00:07:21.445
unhappy about being stranded in the sky with bears, but

00:07:21.525 --> 00:07:24.455
people sure do love constellations

00:07:24.455 --> 00:07:26.455
In this story there's also something we haven't really

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.720
discussed about tricksters, or myths generally

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.880
the desire to be remembered.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:35.335
Coyote leaves no doubt, when he finishes stranding those wolves

00:07:35.335 --> 00:07:38.555
he calls to Meadowlark and says

00:07:38.635 --> 00:07:41.445
 

00:07:41.445 --> 00:07:44.365
 

00:07:44.365 --> 00:07:46.935
 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.760
 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.180
Here at Crash Course we define myths as stories

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.105
that persist through time. In our forthcoming

00:07:55.105 --> 00:07:57.445
episodes about heroes, we'll see that the desire

00:07:57.445 --> 00:08:00.465
for fame; to be remembered through timeless

00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:02.945
tales, often motivates

00:08:02.945 --> 00:08:06.005
heroic deeds. We could tell stories about Coyote

00:08:06.005 --> 00:08:09.085
all day, but there's another famous trickster in Native American myths:

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.155
Raven. No, not that Raven,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.720
not that one either, come on you gu- yeah. That one, bingo, you got it.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.080
Raven's stories are common with the Native American Peoples of the Pacific North-West,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:21.075
including Canada and Alaska.

00:08:21.075 --> 00:08:23.995
This one was recorded in English at Sitka, a

00:08:23.995 --> 00:08:26.945
small city in Alaska, and it starts like so. Have you ever

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:29.905
wondered why ravens are black?

00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:33.375
A very long time ago, Raven, the trickster, was

00:08:33.375 --> 00:08:36.455
actually stark white. And one day,

00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:39.375
he's journeying to visit his brother-in-law, Petrel

00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:42.425
the sea-bird who has an everlasting spring

00:08:42.425 --> 00:08:45.355
of water. At the time, there wasn't any

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:47.940
water to drink, because Petrel kept his spring for himself

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:51.280
and he wouldn't share it. So Raven comes to Petrel, and

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.960
he tells him about all of the marvelous things that

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.860
he's seen throughout the world, trying to get Petrel to leave

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:00.300
his home so that Raven can steal some of his water.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.920
But Petrel doesn't trust Raven

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.500
which is maybe a good call, and he won't budge.

00:09:05.505 --> 00:09:08.545
When the night falls, Raven and Petrel go to bed. Once

00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:11.855
is sure Petrel is asleep, he creeps outside

00:09:11.855 --> 00:09:14.985
and finds some dog poo. Yeah, it's gonna be that kind of story.

00:09:14.985 --> 00:09:17.915
He sneaks back in and he spreads the poo

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.080
all over Petrel's clothing. And the next morning Raven wakes

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.035
Petrel up by crying, "Wake up! Wake up brother-in-law,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.720
look what you've done to your clothes!"

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.320
and just real quick aside here: i wanna point out that we're super unsure about

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.380
what "bird clothes" are. Pants? a Dicky maybe?

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.060
wait

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.980
are these birds with arms? Anyway, Petrel goes outside to clean himself up,

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:42.480
and Raven goes over to the spring, uncovers it,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.320
and begins to drink. Just as Raven has slurped up

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.120
almost all of the water, Petrel returns

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.945
realises he's been tricked, and angrily chases

00:09:50.945 --> 00:09:54.015
Raven away. Raven flies through the smoke-hole

00:09:54.015 --> 00:09:56.835
in Petrel's house with the water in his mouth, and Petrel calls

00:09:56.835 --> 00:09:59.875
out to his spirits to catch him.

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:02.935
As Raven is caught by the spirits, Petrel throws pitchwood

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:05.495
onto his fire to make the smoke

00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:08.305
turn black.While Raven struggles

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.340
to get away, the black smoke soaks into his

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.040
feathers, and I bet you can see where this is headed.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.440
Now turned black, Raven struggles free without spilling

00:10:17.445 --> 00:10:20.205
a single drop of water. But as he's flying

00:10:20.205 --> 00:10:23.475
he tries to brush off some of the char and spills

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.940
some water over Nass, making up the Nass river.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.540
He keeps flying and keeps fidgeting and keeps spilling water

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.820
over Stikine, Taku, Chilkat, and all the other rivers

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.460
even the small drops become creeks

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.060
 

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.995
So after just one poo-stained trick,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.525
the world now has water, and Raven

00:10:43.525 --> 00:10:46.180
has the pitch-black feathers that we know today.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.680
As you can see, Raven and Coyote definitely spend their time

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.840
getting up to no good. Sometimes their tricks are premeditated,

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.320
but other times it's a matter of circumstance, often

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:58.675
poop related circumstance. And this reminds us that just because

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.380
you're powerful, supernatural even,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.820
that doesn't mean you can escape being an animal,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:07.320
with all the confusion, and danger, and bodily functions

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.760
that that entails. This sort of thing reiterates the

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.715
specific relationship in Native American culture between

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.980
humans, and the natural environment.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.655
As Therry and Deviney put it:

00:11:18.655 --> 00:11:21.655
 

00:11:21.655 --> 00:11:24.425
 

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:26.880
 

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.275
So, even though Raven and Coyote pull tricks, that might seem

00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:33.355
outrageous and a little gross, its hard to consider them

00:11:33.355 --> 00:11:36.155
evil or detrimental to society

00:11:36.155 --> 00:11:39.045
especially when their tricks end up creating something

00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:42.035
the rest of us get to enjoy.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.940
Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week.
