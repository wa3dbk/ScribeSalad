Hey there! I'm Mike Rugnetta 
and this is CrashCourse Mythology.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.900
Today, we're going to continue to inundate you with myths about the floods.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.240
And as you can see Thoth isn't going to be caught without a raft this time around.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.299
Last week, we looked at the many mythic traditions that feature a story

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.780
about a god or gods bringing
a flood to destroy humanity

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.240
or at least teach him a real good lesson.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.020
Today, we're headed to China. Anchors away!

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.340
So before we get started for real, now is probably a good time to mention that I don't speak Chinese

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.360
So I'm going to do my best, but, be forewarned

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.340
pronunciation carnage is about to happen.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.860
Bao Qian (I'm sorry...)

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.540
Longtime CrashCourse fans will remember some of today's main story since it was featured in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.480
The first season of CrashCourse World History. I'm talking about our old friend

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.060
Yu the Engineer. 
But first let's take a step back and remember that

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.360
in China real, non-mythical flooding 
is a big and actual deal.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.820
Thousands of years of flood control project have made sure that flooding, especially a kind of two main rivers:

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.000
The Yellow or Huang He, and

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.400
Yangtze, don't wipe out food supply.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.500
And inability to control floods was seen as

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.000
a major shortcoming for emperors 
and often caused social unrest.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.530
Many people believed floods to be natural disasters brought by divine forces

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.340
demonstrating their displeasure with the emperor. And of course if the floods destroyed the food supply

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.078
hungry folks are gonna rebel -- just ask Limos,
Greek Goddess of Hunger.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.700
I wonder if there's a Greek god of being hangry?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.980
So in China anyone who was able to prevent floods or ameliorate their effects

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:49.060
would be considered at the very least a hero and
at the most possibly a god.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.000
In one version of the Chinese flood myth the mythical king Shun had lost heaven's favor and the rivers

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.120
started to overflow.
Yu came to the rescue taming the flood.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.500
Shun was so impressed that he eventually handed his title over to Yu.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.760
This is the mythical origin of
the first Chinese dynasty, the Xia.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.820
In another version of the flood myth the flood just happens, for no apparent reason.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.180
The High God, Di,
called upon the demigod Gun to stop it.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.720
Gun tried his hardest for nine years,
but eventually admits defeat.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.260
After Gun gives up his son Yu takes up the task.
Kinda like the family business.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.820
Fortunately for China, Yu has better luck than his father.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.100
He works for 13 years straight
to end the flood and save the world.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.420
The entire time Yu is the model of diligence and selflessness.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.960
In 13 years, he never once returns home to his wife.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.200
According to one story, he passes his house three times and never goes in.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.180
With his dedication, Yu became a model for future Chinese rulers, the world's first workaholic...

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.540
and a pretty bad husband, it seems.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.360
During those 13 years, Yu tried lots of different flood control methods.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.000
But he also called upon a number of mythical helpers.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.600
His main solution to the flooding

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.640
was to redirect the floodwaters out to the sea often by building levees, canals and dikes.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.220
One time he asked for help from
Yinglong, the Responding Dragon,

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:19.580
who used his tail to create a floodwater shifting barricade directing the water out to sea.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.280
Very cooperative for a dragon.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.800
In another version of the story, Yu and the dragon also get help from a giant black turtle.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.540
Yu also got some help from Hebo,
the God of the Yellow River.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.440
Previously Hebo was a human who drowned while ferrying across the Yellow River.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.800
But the Supreme God took pity on him 
and made him God of the River.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.400
Yu started his flood control efforts at the Yellow River when a god with the face of a man and the body of a fish

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.500
came out of the water and explained that he was Hebo.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.840
He gave Yu a detailed map 
of the locations of China's rivers

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.180
to help him get a better picture of 
what he was up against .

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.640
Yay! Part human part animal gods! Right, Thoth?

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.020
As part of his efforts,
Yu also had to defeat a number of monsters.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.420
He had to kill Xiangliu,
a nine-headed monster with the habit of

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.700
turning perfectly good land into uninhabitable marshes.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.020
Some of the other monsters he managed to spare and even tame, but one creature

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.820
Wuzhiqi, the monster of the Huai River,
gave Yu particular trouble.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.940
Wuzhiqi and his followers made gales and storms that prevented Yu from controlling the flood.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.840
This made Yu mad so he gathered all the gods together and ordered them to clear out the monsters.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.300
Wuzhiqi's monster-god followers were frightened and they surrendered to Yu who put them in jail.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.480
Wuzhiqi himself then appeared in the form of a monkey

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.300
with a green chest, white head,
yellow eyes and white paws...

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.140
Oh, and also the power to stretch his neck 100 feet and the strength of nine elephants.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.260
So that's one scary monkey.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.280
Yu, who is not only a diligent worker but also a consummate manager,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.620
delegated the job of taming Wuzhiqi to a number of subordinates.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.580
Most weren't up to the task until Gengchen,
who chained up Wuzhiqi by his long neck

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.480
and put a golden bell through his nose.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.420
After that the Huai river wasn't trouble anymore.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.660
But of all the assistance that Yu received
over his 13-year battle with flooding,

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.820
no one was more helpful than his wife Tushan-shi.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.200
Yu was too busy to come home
but Tushan-shi didn't take that sitting down.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.780
Understanding the importance of the flooding, 
she worked to find ways to help.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.320
This is clear in one of our favorite Yu flood stories. 
Favorite because Yu...

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.400
Spoiler Alert!

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.880
changes Into a bear.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.800
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.540
Yu is starting to excavate a mountain in order to channel the floodwaters into the sea.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.140
Before he leaves for work, 
he tells Tushan-shi, who's nine-months pregnant,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.300
to bring him food whenever she hears a drum.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.020
Then he goes off to the mountain
and transforms Into a bear

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.080
Because duh...

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.540
bears are much better
at tunneling through mountains than man.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.260
While he's working, he steps on the drum by mistake. 
Tushan-shi hears the drum and brings food to Yu.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.860
But Yu is busy controlling floods and also,
you know... bearing around,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.860
so he fails to notice his wife.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.500
Tushan-shi is standing there,
looking at this bear of a husband

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.480
and she's filled with shame to see him in this form.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.900
Because apparently it's a shameful thing.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.040
Bear etiquette was pretty strict back then, I guess.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.420
Tushan-shi runs away, and as she reaches the mountains base she starts to change into stone.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.220
When Yu finishes his work for the day and turns back into a man, he finds her.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.900
But Tushan-shi had already turned to rock.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.200
Yu politely asked the rock
if she could give him the baby.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:43.520
Tushan-shi obliges, splitting open on her north side.
Out of this fissure, their son, Qi, is born.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.160
This is the same Qi that would later
become the first Xia emperor.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.840
Though it's unclear what Qi thought about having a rock for a mom and a sometimes-bear for a dad...

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:56.520
That must have been tough on Parent-Teacher Conference night.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.640
Thank you, Thought Bubble.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.340
So, stories Involving the Great Yu are quite different from the Jewish and Mesopotamian flood myths

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.340
we looked at in the last episode.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.120
For one thing, these floods don't represent the gods' attempt to wipe out humanity.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.060
In fact, they don't seem to kill many people at all, at least not in the way the ancient Near East El Niño did.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.060
The emperor survives,
so does Yu's wife/rock plus the giant turtle. Go turtle!

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.020
Yu is righteous like Utanapishtim who survives the flood in the epic of Gilgamesh.

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.740
He's chosen to save the world, and he does so,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.660
but more through his intellect and hard work than the intervention of the gods.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.260
I imagine that Yu would have really been grateful for direction on how to build dams and levees,

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.760
but he had to figure it out for himself,
for 13 years.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.480
Yu's devotion to duty in working to save China,
which, in myths, stands for the whole world,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.420
makes him a model human being, and because of the way the stories end, a model emperor.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:57.720
He does everything he can to improve the lives of his people by saving their homes and fields.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.960
He works tirelessly without fail and
demonstrates what can be accomplished

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.840
if we set our mind and energy to a task.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.860
This might be the most significant difference between the Yu myths and other floods.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.900
Noah and Utanapishtim make for, relatively,
shallow role models.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:16.840
Sure they follow God's instructions, but they're not always the epitome of virtue.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.140
Noah even hits the bottle after
inventing vineyards post─flood.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.740
Yu, on the other hand,
is meant to be read as a pristine model.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.560
In terms of a myth providing guidance
for how to live and especially, how to rule,

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:34.360
it doesn't get much better than Yu, his helpful dragon friend and his legendarily patient wife.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.760
Thanks for watching,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.800
We'll see you next week.
