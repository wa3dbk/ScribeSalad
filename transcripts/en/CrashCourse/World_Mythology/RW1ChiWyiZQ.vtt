00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi, there. I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course Mythology, and today we're going to start the first of a few episodes

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.779
a show favorite: trickster stories, but be warned, trickster

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.440
myths can get sexy, a little gross, and they're filled with betrayal, but we should be able to handle it, right Thoth?

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.910
Oh, hmm...

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:26.639
Oh, Thoth, Stan just texted me. You've been promoted to host. So, uh, I'm just going to go grab a coffee. See you later

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.679
Good luck.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.679
[Intro]

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.779
Just kidding. There's no way that Thoth could host the show.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.239
He's like thousands of years old and he only speaks Ancient Egyptian which literally no one understands.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.119
But roping some sucker into doing my work is exactly the sort of thing a trickster would do.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.820
Trickster stories are traditionally very popular, and for a good reason:

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.460
In many trickster stories the underdogs come out on top, and not by virtue of their...

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.560
superior strength or immortal attributes either, but because of their smarts.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.220
Another appealing thing about tricksters Is that they're transgressive. They're rebels and who doesn't love a rebel? Just ask Ares, Greek

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.040
God of War and Rebellion or James Dean the American God of pomade and leather jackets.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.380
A good place to start is mythologist David Leeming's description of a trickster:

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.040
so a moral and scatological, but otherwise a good guy. We all have that friend, I think.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:59.300
Let's begin in Africa. African Trickster stories remain popular and frequently have ambiguous or morally dubious endings.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.060
According to Thury and Devinny,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.820
So let's see exactly what they mean by "disharmony" in the Thought Bubble.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.320
Anansi the spider and his son [] are farmers having a bad year because of a drought.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.860
One day [] is out for a walk lamenting the poor harvest and he sees a hunchback dwarf by the side of the road.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.500
The dwarf asks [] what's wrong, and when he explains the dwarf promises to help.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.860
He tells [] to find two small sticks and tap him lightly on his hump while singing. So, tap tap, and it begins to rain.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.149
Soon the crops start growing. Anansi thinks he can do better and goes to look for the dwarf himself, making sure to bring two big sticks.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.589
The dwarf tells Anansi to tap him on his hump again,

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.090
but Anansi ends up hitting the dwarf so hard that he kills him.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.300
Now, Anansi is scared because the dwarf was the King's favorite jester.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.260
So he puts the dwarf's body in a kola tree and waits.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.330
When his son [] come by and asks his father if he'd seen the dwarf,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.480
Anansi tells him that the dwarf is climbing the tree looking for a kola nut.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.020
The quicken sin climbs up the tree the dwarf's body falls down to the ground

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.620
Anansi cries out that "his son had killed the King's jester!" But [] knows Anansi's tricks and replies that the King was

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.410
actually angry with the dwarf and now he could go to the king and collect a reward.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.669
Knowing there's a bounty Anansi exclaims that he had killed the dwarf.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:35.070
Anansi arrives at the Kings court and discovers the King was not angry with the Jester.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:43.880
But now he's certainly angry with Anansi. The king orders the body of the dwarf to be put in a box which Anansi must carry

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.360
on his head forever unless he finds someone else to carry it.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.529
Eventually, Anansi comes across Ant and asks him to hold the box while he goes to the market, and, wouldn't you know it, Ant falls for it?

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.839
This is why to this day we often see ants carrying great burden. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.119
It's probably becoming clear. Why you know a lot of us just don't trust spiders.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.640
In a number of ways, this is a classic African Trickster story.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.360
It features animals with human characteristics interacting in a human world

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.200
The Trickster is initially undone by his own greed.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.560
If Anansi had just listened to his son and not tried to outdo him, he would have been okay.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.049
Also, maybe he shouldn't have tried to frame his son for a murder.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.289
But Anansi fails in his attempt to hide his crime because his son knows his reputation for duplicity.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.320
Despite his cleverness Anansi's greed gets the better of him.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.800
His desire for the reward leads him to admit his bad deed and be punished for it.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.500
And if he did end up carrying the coffin for eternity, the story might provide a lesson about justice,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.340
but Anansi, being a trickster, is able to convince someone else to bear his burden.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.560
So he gets off scot-free. The ending of the story does explain a natural phenomenon

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.520
(why ants are so industrious),

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.160
but the story isn't exactly a model for good behavior. In the end Anansi gets away with killing the dwarf.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.440
His comeuppance is brief and the only thing he learns is that ants are total suckers.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.800
It's really like a Quentin Tarantino film of trickster myths.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.880
The story of Anansi and the Ant bears some resemblance to one of Hercules's labors.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.878
We'll talk more about Hercules when we get to our episode on heroes,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.920
but the long and short is that he had to do twelve labors, and completing them cemented his reputation.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.100
One of these labours, the eleventh, was to gather Zeus's Golden Apples from the far end of the Earth.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.940
These apples were guarded by a dragon (Ladon) and the Hesperides,

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.340
nymphs who were the daughters of Atlas, the Titan with the unenviable task of holding the world on his shoulders.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.800
Talk about legendary back pain.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.380
It took a long time and a number of adventures before Hercules even found out where the apples were,

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.400
but eventually he is told about them by another trickster, Prometheus.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.060
You remember him, he's the guy who stole fire for the Humans and was punished by being chained to a rock

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.340
and having his liver eaten daily by an eagle.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.159
Well good news, eventually Hercules kills that eagle and in return Prometheus tells him

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:07.639
that the way to get the apples isn't to fight a dragon, but to simply ask Atlas.

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:13.849
Atlas can easily get past his daughters and that Mr. Dragon. No sweat.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.969
So hercules makes a deal with Atlas hercules will hold up the world giving Atlas a much-needed break and in return, apples.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.520
Atlas is thrilled because I mean think about it, how would you feel holding up the literal world all the time?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.040
So he leaves, he goes he grabs the apples.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:34.819
The problem is that when he returns he tells Hercules that he really doesn't want to hold up the earth and the sky anymore.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:41.080
So like maybe that's just your job now Hercules. I don't know, just spit balling here.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.340
So here's Hercules, he can't move, he's holding the world after all, but he does some quick tricky thinking.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:56.520
He tells Atlas "Sure, he'll do it", but could atlas take the Earth and Sky back for just a second while he gets some padding for his shoulders?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.140
And when Atlas agrees, Hercules grabs the apples and vamooses.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.320
Tricksters tricking tricksters. Kind of like [???].

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:09.980
In these stories, we see that it often doesn't take much for a trickster to figure out how to fool the object of his trick, sometimes called a dupe.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.580
Often the dupe doesn't really deserve it, although it's hard to feel sorry for Atlas,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.120
who was attempting some minor league trickstering himself.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.700
While tricksters can be seen as playful scamps, they also show us that play can be dangerous,

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.660
especially, when like Anansi, we let it go too far.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.100
in the Anansi story, the trickster acts as what Leonard and McClure call a moral counterexample.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:54.500
We're usually better off when we don't lie or cheat each other, but that's exactly what tricksters do.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.020
We're typically happy when they're punished for their tricks, but this doesn't always happen.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:05.980
Trickster stories can be especially troubling because not only do they usually get away with their tricks, but are often celebrated for it.

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:13.880
Tricksters aren't all bad, though. The trickster can provide a model for the oppressed to reclaim some autonomy in the face of overwhelming power.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.080
This is one of the main lessons of the Br'er rabbit stories which are descended from African Trickster stories,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.240
but transplanted into the context of chattel slavery in English-speaking North America.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.780
Br'er can be seen as representing slaves who would use their ingenuity to fort and outsmart cruel plantation owners

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.900
Maybe then, it's worth asking what would happen if the tricksters just always won.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:41.490
And the truth is while some tricksterism may be justified and a little bit of transgression here and there is fun,

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:49.060
if everyone decides that it's okay to beat dwarves to death in order to double the amount of rainfall, metaphorically speaking, that wouldn't be great.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.640
Trickster stories are often morally ambiguous in this way.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:58.220
Even Br'er rabbit isn't all clearly the good guy, and that's one part of why we like them so much, maybe.

00:08:58.220 --> 00:09:05.060
Sometimes it's simply a thrill to break the rules. We as human can see ourselves pretty clearly in the trickster myths.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:10.880
It's hard to identify with someone who can hold the world or who goes on errands for the father of creation,

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.480
but we've all at least tried our hand.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:19.840
Bamboozling someone into taking over our responsibility. Sorry Thoth, you're a good sport.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.840
Thanks for watching, we'll see everyone next week.
