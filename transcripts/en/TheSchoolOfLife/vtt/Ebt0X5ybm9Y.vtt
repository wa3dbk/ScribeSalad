00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.700
People nowadays often say, sometimes in a sad way, other times more aggressively and cynically,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.200
that life just has no meaning.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.340
Two reasons are often given for this.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.480
The first has to do with religion.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.580
Once upon a time, so the story goes, life had a clear meaning given to us by God;

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.200
it was about worshiping him,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.240
but as religious belief has declined, not only has God supposedly died,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.860
but along with him, the meaning he once guaranteed.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.420
Modern science is the second course at the current
crisis of meaning. Scientists tell us that

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.969
life

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.309
which emerged from a random interplay
of chemicals and gases

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.820
does have a meaning but it's of a rather bleak, relentless, and narrow sort.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.329
For humans as for all other living
things like amoeba

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.780
the meaning of life is survival and the
propagation of one's genetic material

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.610
It sounds very true and at the same time
distinctly futile and melancholy.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.910
Here we want to argue as follows: to wonder
about the meaning of life

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.369
is an extremely important activity, life
does have substantial meaning

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.770
And there are in fact a range of
practical steps we can take

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.470
to ensure we end up leading lives of
maximal meaningfulness.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.340
We should stop by saying
that there is no meaning in life

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.850
outside of that which we can find by
ourselves as a species

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.369
there isn't any kind of objective
meaning written in the stars

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.623
in a holy book or in sequences of DNA.
What seems to prompt people to complain

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.869
that life lacks meaning

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.871
are particular varieties of unhappiness. Let's
consider some central examples

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.740
you're in a relationship but the
intensity you experienced at the start

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.579
is long gone

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.049
you don't seem to talk about anything
important anymore or share vulnerable

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.579
feelings and ideas.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.700
It feels, as you put it, meaningless or
else you're single and though you have

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.530
many friends

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.720
every time you see them the conversation
seems shallow and trivial

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.030
or you're at University studying for a
degree. You signed up for the course

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.659
in part because you often feel confused
about who you are and what you want

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.819
you thought that reading books and going
to lectures would shine a light on things,

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.000
but the topics of Darwin disconnected
from your confusion.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.700
You complained that it feels meaningless.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.590
Or you're working in a large profitable
company

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.720
and earning a decent sum every week, but the work doesn't seem in the grandeur scheme

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.470
important by which you mean two things: that you don't seem to be making any

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.400
great difference to anyone's life

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.680
and also that there's no profound part of you that you're able to bring to or

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.349
incorporate in your work;

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.900
it might as well be done by robots. From
these strands

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.060
we can start to extrapolate a theory of meaning.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.519
Meaning is to be found in three
activities in particular

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.959
Communication; Understanding and Service

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.870
Let's look at communication first. We are, by nature

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.049
isolated creatures and it appears that
some of our most meaningful moments

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.709
are to do with instances of connection, with the lover for example

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.120
when we reveal our intimate physical and
psychological selves

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.610
when we form friendships with
substantial truths about our respective

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.819
lives can be shared

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.650
all on a journey to a new country when
we strike up a conversation with a

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.349
stranger

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.959
and feel a thrilling sense of victory over
linguistic and cultural barriers

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.359
then there's the meaning that emerges
via understanding

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.440
this is about the pleasure that can be
felt whenever we correct confusion and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.739
puzzlement about ourselves or the world

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.859
we might be scientific researchers or
economists

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.040
poets or patients in psychotherapy. The
pleasure of our activities

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.280
stems from a common ability to map and
make sense of what was once

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.040
painfully unfamiliar and strange

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400
Thirdly, there is service, one of the most meaningful
things we can do

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.169
is to serve other people, to try to
improve their lives

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.169
either by alleviating sources of
suffering

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.220
or else by generating new sources of
pleasure

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.780
that includes medical professionals but
also people who bake cakes, write songs

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.830
or dance for a living

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.830
we're often told to think of ourselves
as inherently selfish

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.760
but some of the most meaningful moments
come when we can transcend our egos

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.900
and put ourselves at the service of
others or the planet

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.030
one should add that in order for
service to feel meaningful

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.650
it has to be in sync with our own native
sincere interests

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.989
it's a case of knowing enough about
ourselves to find a particular path to service.

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.389
Armed with such ideas, we can move
towards defining nothing less

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.950
than the meaning of life. The meaning of life
is to pursue human flourishing

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.389
through communication, understanding and
service.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.630
We may not have meaningful lives yet but
it's central to affirm

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.220
that the concept of a meaningful life is
eminently plausible

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.520
and that it comprises elements that
can be clearly named

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.250
and gradually fought for.
