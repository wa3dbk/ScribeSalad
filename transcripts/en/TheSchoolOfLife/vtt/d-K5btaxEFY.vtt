00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:07.400
It can be so hard to forgive because – so
often – we simply are in the right and the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.640
scale of the folly, thoughtlessness and meanness
of others seems utterly beyond our own measure.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.250
But there are two inviolable ideas which should
nevertheless, in the face of the grossest

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.080
behavior, be kept in mind to increase our
chances of being able to forgive.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:35.000
Firstly: we must remember how the other person
got there, to this place of idiocy and cruelty.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.580
Every irritating fault in another person has
a long history behind it. They have become

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.190
like this because of flaws in their development,
which they did not choose for themselves.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.610
They were shaped by troubles which we cannot
see but which we can know exist. The arrogant

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.420
person was trapped (at some key point in their
personal evolution) in an environment where

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.829
being modest and reasonable seemed to guarantee
they’d be trampled on. The hyper-critical

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:11.140
individual has lived too much, as their personality
was growing, around people who couldn’t

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.760
take a gentle hint – so they came to rely
on blunt assertions. The frustratingly timid,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.140
mousy person was (at some stage) terrified;
the show-off learned their irritating manner

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.530
around people who were hard to please. Behind
every failing – behind everything that’s

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.250
wrong and infuriating about those we meet
– is a decisive trauma encountered before

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.909
someone could cope with it properly. They
are maddening but they got to be this way

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:49.640
without meaning to. To forgive is to understand
the origins of evil and cruelty. Secondly,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.250
and very strangely, there are difficult things
about you too. Of course, not in this area.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.270
Not in any area remotely connected to the
sort of lapses that destroy your faith in

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.540
humanity. But in some areas, quiet areas that
you forget about as soon as you’ve travelled

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:14.520
through them, you too are a deeply imperfect
and questionable individual. Gently, you have

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.450
– in your own way – betrayed. Nicely,
you have been a coward. Modestly, you have

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.190
forgotten your privileges. Unthinkingly, you
have added salt to the wounds of others. We

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.480
don’t need to know anything about you to
know this as a certainty. We must forgive

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.930
because – not right now, not over this,
but one day, over something – we need to

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.709
be forgiven. We would – in the past – regularly
have looked up to the heavens for this forgiveness.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:54.640
We do that less and less. But that doesn’t
attenuate the need for some moments when we

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.569
limber up to utter that most implausible word
‘sorry’ – or indeed stretch our ethical

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:10.080
imagination in order to pronounce those even
more arduous and unnatural words, ‘I forgive you.
