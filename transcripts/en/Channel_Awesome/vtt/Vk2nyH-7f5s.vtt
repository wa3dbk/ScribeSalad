00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.000
[D] Alright, So this is us watching, uh, Suicide Squad

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.680
Now with this we do it a little differently ([R]Hey! Academy Award Winning Suicide Squad) Academy Award winning

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.520
Suicide Squad, Don't think we aren't putting that in the review somewhere. Um, But uh

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.540
This is a clip-less review so uh so we don't really take notes for it because

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.780
With regular reviews we have to . . . Sort of make fun of the actual clips that you see

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.540
[D]With the clipless we have to explain it, 
we have to act it out
[R] We just throw garbage at the TV, basically

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.080
So, so it's a little bit more like, the ideas. We talk more about the ideas, and different ways of showing it and expressing it

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.340
So, where we don't necessarily need the clips

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.460
Uh, but we still kinda do the same thing, we like

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.700
talk at it and say jokes to it

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.280
even when we're watching at the theater

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.520
I have seen it

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.660
I... like it more than I dislike it

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.860
But I know it's not really a good movie

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.340
He has not. I think he's gonna hate it.
[R]That's a...

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.800
[D] I think he's really gonna hate it
[R] That's a thrilling endorsement

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.400
[D] Yeah.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.420
We're just gonna get to watch it. Here we go!

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.680
[Laughs] [D] Brought to you by the letter "R"!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.180
Suicide Street

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.740
[R] Alright, so... already I had to close the curtains

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.240
Because the movie's so dark,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.320
I couldn't see a damn thing!

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.240
"Let's have some fun."

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160
[R] "Let's have some fun". Words never heard in a DC movie ever

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.060
[D]Cirque du S... Harley

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
[R] Multipass? Is she dressed as Leeloo from 5th element?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.860
[D] Multipersonality

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.420
[D] Just immediately, the soundtrack is win

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.600
[R] Yeah

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.540
[D] I just love this weird combination of songs

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.140
That's like half the women I've dated.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140
"And that is why I'm here."

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.160
[R] Random spot for the title
[D] Weird spot for the title, yeah

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.260
[R] Black woman smiles,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.360
There's our Suicide Squad... title

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.280
[R] Superman shared our values.
 He totally took out the military satellites

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.780
That was like the first thing he did
 in the end of that movie

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.380
Cool! We're in the video game version!

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.240
... Okay, why not ...

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.740
[D] It's awesome!

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.340
That's so stupid but so awesome!

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.900
Before he even falls he's already halfway down the building.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.280
See that is sh!t that's just so cool!
[R] It helps...

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.680
[R] It's kinda like the Fantastic 4 movie, it helps when the first thing you do in the movie is just stupid

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.760
So I'm like : Okay, I'm not supposed 
to take this super seriously

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.480
[D] Yeah.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.840
We've got back to a traditional Will Smith movie here.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.060
[R] Is this a romantic comedy?

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080
F%cking Batman, man ?!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.020
I wh.. what??!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.840
"I love you, Daddy."

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.640
Boo! F%ck you Batman!!!

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.900
"I need a machine gun."

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:26.480
[R] Kay.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.180
He looks like a trustworthy guy

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.320
"You're ruining date night!"

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.420
I'm so noble

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.640
Did I ever tell you how I used a 10 year-old 
black girl as a human shield?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.880
[D] I totally knew he wasn't gonna do it

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.200
Like, 80% sure

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.160
You know it really would have made the Batman vs Superman movie better

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.500
[R] Oh, that's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.960
[D] Really, when you think about it,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.560
We should have made a movie out of 
ONE of these people

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.300
[R] I'm kind of thinking the same thing

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.740
Oh, it's Wednesday Addams!

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.520
[D] I see more evil Hermione...

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.820
Except she could probably sing

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.060
[R] Oh...

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.760
Too soon...

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.180
"In a world of flying men and monsters,
this is the only way to protect our country."

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.640
[D &amp; R] Uh... Umm...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.500
[R] Questions?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.280
[D] Many... Many questions

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.280
[R] So... She's the bad guy?

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.120
[D] No.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:17.520
[R] No? Okay.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.180
[D] No, but good guess

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.560
No, the bad guy in this is so out of nowhere

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.380
in a sense, that's like... pff! What?!

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.780
Suddenly the movie is like : oh we have a villain now

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.300
and it's like, wait, it was that b...? O... Okay.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.840
[R] Yeah... Is there a villain yet? I haven't seen anybody

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.640
[D] Well, they're technically "all villains" but

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.680
Yeah... No.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:33.420
[R] Oooh!

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.160
It's like an evil Sailor Moon. ☾

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.760
[R] Now,

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.120
What are we doing?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.960
I just... I haven't seen a villain yet, I haven't...

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.140
It's literally just like:

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.500
We need these guys, why?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.480
Mm.. Something, Superman... I dunno

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.140
[D] Honestly, this is one of those weird movies 
where the best part of the movie

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.420
is when there's no story

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.780
He will charm the hell out of you

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.860
Unlock his coolness

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.860
"That's my price, sweetie. You know what it is."

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.320
[R] Oh, Will!

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.340
I'd still tap that.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.140
Where there's a Will, there's a gay.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.080
"That could change with a phone call."

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.640
[R] He's the bad guy...

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.220
[D] Nope!

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.660
[R] The phone's the bad guy!

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.740
[D] It would make more sense...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.320
There's a part of me that just wonders, like

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.200
Does he just sit there spray painting

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.580
"HA! HA!" like, that's...

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.500
I guess this is crazy... I don't know

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.580
[R] I'm... not... nearly that impressed with him

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.440
[D] No. It's...

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.760
Another Joker

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.100
He's not good, he's not bad

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.500
He's just... another Joker

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.440
[R] She's the bad guy!

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.940
HE'S the bad guy!

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.860
The lamp's the bad guy!

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.420
[D] You know, why is Croc a thing?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.920
[R] I don't know

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.540
[D] They use him so many times

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.980
[R] I've never found him interesting

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.600
[D] Never!

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.740
The best thing he had was that "It was a rock" Line!

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.500
"You are so screwed."

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.340
"What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?!"

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.840
Okay,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.240
Dumbest part of the movie

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.380
Like, f%ck you movie

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.280
That's the last we see of that guy

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.800
...

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.220
"You are so screwed" "you are so..." "what do you mean?" "what do you mean?"

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:58.640
We never find out.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.140
[R] WHAT?!

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.780
[D] Yeah, what the f%ck!

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.780
I like that Joker uses the new technology

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.900
Like, he updated

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.640
I think that's cool

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.360
Yeah, so, um... She's the bad guy

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.680
[R] Oh.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.000
[D] Yeah, just... oh.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.200
[R] So, really, they just created this whole mess their damn selves...

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.180
[D] Pretty much...

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.880
I mean... Come on!

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.520
You get all the world's worst supervillains together and

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.400
one of 'em goes nuts, I mean

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.560
I... j... Pff!

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.740
Where'd this come from?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800
There's your sky portal, oh god dammit!

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.660
[R] OOOOHMYGOD! ANOTHER SKY PORTAL!

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.440
What about Batman, The Flash...?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.380
[D] Right?!

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.820
Why weren't they getting THOSE people together?

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.300
"Hey, one minute I'm playing mahjong with me nana,
and this red streak kicks me outta nowhere!"

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.320
[R] Is that English?
[D] I have no idea what that he just said

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.280
[R] I just heard :  ajuwowuwowahwuwowie!

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.760
He speaks like Starfox characters

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.160
[D &amp; R] Wubbuwuwowu

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.760
[R]This would be way more entertaining if she uses that mallet and it makes cartoon noises

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.440
It'd be entertaining if she has all these items rigged

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.260
With speakers so they make cartoon noises

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:55.260
[D] That... That's what I was thinking, yeah

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.520
That'd be actually really cool

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.340
"What are we some kinda suicide squad?"

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.520
No, your place is now in the Return of the King

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.840
[R] It shall be known as the Fellowship of the Ring

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.300
[D] The Forging of the Two Towers

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.040
D'you know there's only one Lord of The Ring ...

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.580
Who the F%ck is this?

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.120
[R] Well I know who this is, 'cause I watched Arrow... but

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.600
[D] Yeah, so she... 
[R] There's no introduction here in the movie

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.260
[D] This is her intro...

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.980
[R] What?!

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.960
[D] Yeah...

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.340
[R] How do you make a movie, and call it Suicide Squad

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.440
And have it be completely bloodless?

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.140
[D] Better rate it so... they could say Sh!t a couple times...

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:29.120
I love the smell of sellout in the morning

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.720
"Mind Games."
"What's that?"

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.420
"Those... bomb in the neck crap."

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.560
Listen, there's only so many names we could have over of the title

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.940
[D] It's Quiet
[R] Yeah
[D] Too quiet

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.320
Why isn't there a... song from the soundtrack?

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.660
Clearly we needed Harley Quinn to point and shoot that gun

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:49.220
You know what the nice thing is?

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.520
Everything in here is so black so I'm so glad the villains they're fighting are

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.020
completely black

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.980
[R] Just like dirt on dirt

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.820
[D] We're not Marvel, okaaay?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.880
How would you like to be that Egyptian god that

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.620
puts all these minions together, it's like

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.380
Oh bat, God!

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.540
[R] Just look at the streets. So Metropolis is... Chicago

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.280
Gotham is Chicago

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.800
[ D&amp;R] And now Midway City is Chicago

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.240
This is why [D]Gotham and Metropolis are right next to each other in
[R] these all fu... yeah

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.660
[D]  Batman V Superman, 'cause it's literally the same city

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.580
[R] This is why these films all look alike

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.520
[D] Okay, you don't want to see that to every single one, you know

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.200
They... They kinda get the idea

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.780
So, that's where Gozer is, huh?

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.200
Again, the best action scenes are with her 'cause I CAN SEE HER !!!

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.800
[R] Well, we know why that is

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.360
"C'mon, let's go."

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.560
[D]Yeah I... legitimately don't know why we were surprised

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.740
Or standing around

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:43.320
I... we... uh

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.540
Director, hello?

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.780
Hello? Why were we doing that?

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.820
[R] I love Croc's character development

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.680
[D] I'd say has he had a line, but right now... Like, has he had a word?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.300
"Don't touch me!"
"What you gonna do? I'm touching you!"

00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.100
So he broke his years and years vow of not hurting anyone

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.180
Because "not touching you", " I'm not touching you" !

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.820
That one was too far!

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.040
[R] D'you think that's how Satan tempted Christ?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.560
Forty days in the desert, just like : I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.040
"Desire becomes surrender,
surrender becomes power."

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:15.100
[D] Are we Nolaning this or what?

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.680
Shall I whip out the philosophy book?

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.240
"Admit it, Rick. I was right."

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.820
What? What do you mean you were right?!

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.640
Your bad guy caused all of this!
[R] Yeah! I...

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.480
"Don't get high-spirited on me
and ruin a good thing."

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.440
[D] Most threatening person in this movie is a woman in a pant suit...

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.200
[R] Okay, him in the suit firing the machine gun I kinda like

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.200
"Kill Harley Quinn."

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.220
"Do it for your freedom and your kid."
"Now she dead."

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.480
Ahh, see that's what I like!

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.920
See, it gets it ocasionnally

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.460
[D] Yeah.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.960
"I missed."

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.400
I always go back and forth with that 'cause on one
 hand, it's like, that's like your kid and

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.480
Your freedom and your stuff, but then I'm like... Ehh...

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.780
I wouldn't trust her anyway, you know

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.060
"I got some grape soda on ice
 and a bear-skin rug waitin'."

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.460
That might be my favorite line

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.480
[R] That... That is so bizarre it's kind of amazing.
[D] Yeah.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.300
[R] Dead.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.380
[D] But what do you think of him legitimately, like...

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:13.160
why did he save her

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.040
going in

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.760
like, there's a ton of times he could've let her die

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.660
but he comes to her instead, what do you think of that?

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.300
I surprisingly don't mind it

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.260
'cause I've seen the other version so many times
[R] Yeah

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.360
[D] So I'm kinda like yeah... I'm actually okay with it.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.580
[R] The film doesn't make me care enough

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.640
To really even get worked up about it.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:32.140
[D] ♪ I know he's so obviously not dead ♫

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.300
[R] I've given up on this abusive relationship !

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.920
I'm gonna star in better films!

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.500
Here's my problem: We already saw this!

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.100
This is a giant waste of time!

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.080
[D] I agree

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.820
And like, they cut it, and they didn't show that. We'll save it for later

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.780
WHY?

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.880
Yes, yes, I know all o' dis!

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.780
Command me, Lord

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.900
"We need a miracle."

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:55.760
F%ck this movie!

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.920
[R] That's kinda where I'm at right now

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.300
And it started off better

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:00.840
but I'm just kind of tapped out

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:01.460
Like,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.420
I don't care anymore

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:05.340
[D] I don't get why that was the big "OH, I'm done"

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.400
[R] Well, they treated that like some big reveal, too

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.400
But WE KNEW ALL THAT!

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.540
[D] And even she, on the other side who's like: NO! That was too far.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:13.940
Like, why?

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.960
"Don't forget, we're the bad guys."

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.960
Don't you, audience. Don't forget. We're the bad guys.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.220
"Not me, shorty. I'm beautiful."

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.240
That's such a horribly written line, I think it's kind of awesome

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.040
"Not me, I'm beautiful"

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.380
I'm just like, okay, you... you had one line... And you owned it

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.380
[R] Gah! It's like the rare moment!

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.800
where the comedy kicks in

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.540
I'm like, oh, see, that's what I wanted

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.140
[D] Can you imagine if they didn't go back and do

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.120
the reshoots to add the comedy?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.560
I'd be like, Christ!

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.660
"The man who killed her husband used that sword.
 His soul's trapped inside of it."

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.740
[R] Thanks for telling us, not showing us, movie

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:54.580
It's okay, it was made for the fans... They know!

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.600
They read the comics, they don't need to see it

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.180
in glorious big screen

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.300
That pisses me off more

00:10:59.360 --> 00:10:59.980
'cause if I'm a fan

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.060
I'm like : NO! That's exactly what I wanna see!

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:02.980
[D] Yeah...

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.760
I wanna see the comic book come to life

00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:07.140
Now you just say : yeah that happened in the comic, go read that...

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:08.220
F%CK YOU !!!

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.800
[D] So much for the fans, we didn't even make a movie

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.320
We just have a giant comic that we just show ...

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.060
On Camera.
[R] It's for the faaans.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:17.920
And we took half of that comic out 'cause we just figured

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:19.900
you know it already, 'cause for the faans!

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.940
♫ There's a place in France

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.580
where the naked ladies dance ♫

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.240
♪ Do the egyptian ♪

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.320
[D] I really like Harley

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.700
[R] Okay. Worth the price of admission right there

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.940
[D] And a lot of people are like : No, you can't see them without the makeup! Like...

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:35.740
[R] This make up sucks anyway!

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:36.720
Why do I give a sh!t...

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.780
If this were a better Joker, I'd agree with that.

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.180
This Joker is not that great

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.920
Still more character development than in Fantastic Four

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.160
[D] I was cool the whole thing. I'm out.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.180
[R] Okay.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.180
[D] Yeah... I totally forgot what that was...

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.080
I... I totally blocked that out from my memory

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.120
Like, what the f%ck was that?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.400
Why could he do that?

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.380
What's the Egyptian word for "screw"?

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.320
[R] I don't know, but apparently

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.680
these writers knew it

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.700
Poor belly-dancing Hermione

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.740
[D] That just made me more angry

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:13.840
I'm gonna move even moooore!

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.800
Blowser the bloserian

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.800
"You messed with my friends!"

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.360
Now, see, if she said...

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.740
"You hurt Mr. J"

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.080
Then that would've made more sense
[R] Then, I would've, yeah...

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.440
I haven't seen much in the way of just like "oh yes, we really care about each other"

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.800
[D] I mean, you had the bar scene, but I don't think that's enough

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.640
for like

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.000
NO, no, I'm willing to risk everything

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.400
[R] That didn't even happen 40 minutes before it did, and

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.580
you need to add more character development along the way

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.000
"Katana, no!"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.940
[D] Her whole job is just being told "No"

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:41.520
[R] Yeah

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.300
[D] Katana, no!

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.960
You only use your powers when it's useless

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.960
"You don't have the balls."

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:50.540
She always knew how to get my goat!

00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:53.500
[R] I had a sword, I could've done it myself.

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.420
But you said no

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.760
[D] I literally don't have the balls and could've done it... I...

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.460
[R] Yeah...

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.980
*sighs* Well, I have seen hardly any suicides

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.400
I expected more...

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.920
[D] Venkman, Venkman!

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.660
[R] She's still in there!

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.940
[D] Actually, I forgot what a cool effect that is. That was really cool!

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.940
"--hypotenuse, so you'd have to know this angle."

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.120
You would legitimately know that, I like that

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.880
Okay, if this is Batman, and this is you, what shot

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.380
would I have to make to get him to get YOU out of the way

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.140
Yeah, just... bring up an old wound

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.040
"Let's go home."

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.760
Why is that even the ending?

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.360
I just saw them like, oh, okay

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.580
so that happened

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.540
[R] I didn't miss him at all

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.680
[D] You know what'll be cooler?

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.400
If you f%cking ended on that guy

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.240
you said you were gonna get the guard

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:36.940
The cop!

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:38.520
Who never shows up again

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.860
[R] That movie wasn't terrible

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.960
But it wasn't really very good

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.640
[D] To me it is, like I said, like

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.500
The first 40, maybe even 50 minutes

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.280
I'm like: okay, this is actually okay

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.680
Doesn't make any sense, but
[R] It's alright, yeah, the first

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.240
[D] Then it sorta gets less and less and then, just like

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.680
This is with the comedy added IN !

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.620
[R] I know! That's what... That's what blows my mind

00:13:57.620 --> 00:13:59.600
Like, if this was the comedy added in

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.040
HOLY F%CK

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.460
[D] What was the original?
[R] Yeah...

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.140
[D] Say "For the fans" one more time

00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:05.400
[R] It's for the faaans!

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.260
[D] Yeah. That's Suicide Squad

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:08.660
And,uh, yeah.
[R] That happened

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:11.320
[D]Like I said, we're just gonna, uh, take a lot of these ideas

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.160
and things we said

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.200
And we're gonna turn it into the review

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.720
By the time you see this, review will already be out

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.000
