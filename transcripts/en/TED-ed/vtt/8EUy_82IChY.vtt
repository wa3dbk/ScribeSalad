[John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible]

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:41.578
[Adapted from a TEDTalk
given by John Lloyd in 2009]

00:00:41.602 --> 00:00:44.242
June Cohen: Our next speaker
has spent his whole career

00:00:44.266 --> 00:00:45.766
eliciting that sense of wonder.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.142
Please welcome John Lloyd.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.242

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:49.422
[Hall of Mirrors]

00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:53.201
The question is, "What is invisible?"

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.654
There's more of it
than you think, actually.

00:00:55.678 --> 00:00:58.389
Everything, I would say --
everything that matters --

00:00:58.413 --> 00:01:02.620
Except every thing, and except matter.

00:01:02.644 --> 00:01:04.066
We can see matter

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.718
but we can't see what's the matter.

00:01:06.742 --> 00:01:11.850
We can see the stars and the planets
but we can't see what holds them apart,

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:13.248
or what draws them together.

00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:17.001
With matter as with people,
we see only the skin of things,

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:20.806
we can't see into the engine room,
we can't see what makes people tick,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.354
at least not without difficulty,

00:01:22.378 --> 00:01:25.998
and the closer we look at anything,
the more it disappears.

00:01:26.022 --> 00:01:28.223
In fact, if you look
really closely at stuff,

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:30.590
if you look at the basic
substructure of matter,

00:01:30.614 --> 00:01:32.026
there isn't anything there.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.196
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.724
One of the interesting things
about invisibility is,

00:01:37.748 --> 00:01:40.670
the things that we can's see,
we also can't understand.

00:01:40.694 --> 00:01:44.844
Gravity is one thing that we can't see,
and which we don't understand.

00:01:44.868 --> 00:01:47.773
It's the least understood
of all the four fundamental forces,

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:51.340
and the weakest, and nobody really
knows what it is or why it's there.

00:01:51.364 --> 00:01:55.031
For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,
the greatest scientist who ever lived,

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:57.493
he thought Jesus came
to Earth specifically

00:01:57.517 --> 00:01:59.375
to operate the levers of gravity.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.304
That's what he thought he was there for.

00:02:01.328 --> 00:02:04.051
So, bright guy, could be wrong
on that one, I don't know.

00:02:04.075 --> 00:02:05.089
(Laughter)

00:02:05.113 --> 00:02:09.758
Consciousness. I see all your faces;
I've no idea what any of you are thinking.

00:02:09.782 --> 00:02:10.850
Isn't that amazing?

00:02:10.874 --> 00:02:13.636
Isn't it incredible that we can't read
each other's minds,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.052
when we can touch each other,
taste each other,

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:19.410
perhaps, if we get close enough,
but we can't read each other's minds.

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:20.944
I find that quite astonishing.

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:23.908
In the Sufi faith,
this great Middle Eastern religion

00:02:23.932 --> 00:02:26.241
which some claim
is the root of all religions,

00:02:26.265 --> 00:02:31.021
Sufi masters are
all telepaths, so they say,

00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:33.548
but their main exercise of telepathy

00:02:33.572 --> 00:02:37.674
is to send out powerful signals
to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.

00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:41.032
So that's why we don't think it exists;
the Sufi masters working on us.

00:02:41.818 --> 00:02:45.217
In the question of consciousness
and artificial intelligence,

00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:48.462
artificial intelligence has really,
like the study of consciousness,

00:02:48.486 --> 00:02:51.115
gotten nowhere, we have no idea
how consciousness works.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.764
Not only have they not created
artificial intelligence,

00:02:53.788 --> 00:02:56.193
they haven't yet created
artificial stupidity.

00:02:56.217 --> 00:02:57.969
(Laughter)

00:02:57.993 --> 00:03:02.085
The laws of physics: invisible,
eternal, omnipresent, all powerful.

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.251
Remind you of anyone?

00:03:04.052 --> 00:03:05.396
Interesting.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.586
I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.358
And I've found a very useful
new word -- ignostic.

00:03:11.382 --> 00:03:12.640
Okay? I'm an ignostic.

00:03:12.664 --> 00:03:13.721
[God?]

00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:16.460
I refuse to be drawn on the question
on whether God exists

00:03:16.484 --> 00:03:18.608
until somebody properly defines the terms.

00:03:18.632 --> 00:03:21.257
Another thing we can't see
is the human genome.

00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:26.275
And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.157
when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain

00:03:30.181 --> 00:03:31.489
around 100 thousand genes.

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:34.874
Every year since,
it's been revised downwards.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:38.291
We now think there are likely
to be just over 20 thousand genes

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:39.531
in the human genome.

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:42.809
This is extraordinary,
because rice -- get this --

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:45.775
rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.800
Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,
two more than people,

00:03:50.824 --> 00:03:52.384
and the same as a gorilla.

00:03:52.408 --> 00:03:53.878
(Laughter)

00:03:55.365 --> 00:03:58.341
You can't see these things,
but they are very strange.

00:03:58.365 --> 00:04:01.058
The stars by day, I always
think that's fascinating.

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:02.387
The universe disappears.

00:04:02.411 --> 00:04:04.687
The more light there is,
the less you can see.

00:04:05.811 --> 00:04:08.180
Time. Nobody can see time.

00:04:08.204 --> 00:04:09.673
I don't know if you know this.

00:04:09.697 --> 00:04:12.424
There's a big movement in modern physics

00:04:12.448 --> 00:04:14.458
to decide that time doesn't really exist,

00:04:14.482 --> 00:04:16.789
because it's too inconvenient
for the figures.

00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:18.839
It's much easier if it's not really there.

00:04:18.863 --> 00:04:21.223
You can't see the future, obviously,

00:04:21.247 --> 00:04:23.943
and you can't see the past,
except in your memory.

00:04:23.967 --> 00:04:26.030
One of the interesting
things about the past

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:27.673
is you particularly can't see --

00:04:27.697 --> 00:04:29.373
my son asked me this the other day,

00:04:29.397 --> 00:04:31.936
"Dad, can you remember
what I was like when I was two?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.968
And I said, "Yes." He said, "Why can't I?"

00:04:33.992 --> 00:04:35.184
Isn't that extraordinary?

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:39.294
You cannot remember what happened to you
earlier than the age of two or three.

00:04:39.318 --> 00:04:43.159
Which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job.

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:45.595
Because that's where all the stuff happens

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.064
(Laughter)

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:49.728
that makes you who you are.

00:04:51.359 --> 00:04:54.145
Another thing you can't see
is the grid on which we hang.

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.192
This is fascinating.

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:58.689
You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed.

00:04:58.713 --> 00:05:01.891
Skin flakes off, hairs grow,
nails, that kind of stuff --

00:05:01.915 --> 00:05:05.024
but every cell in your body
is replaced at some point.

00:05:05.048 --> 00:05:07.491
Taste buds, every ten days or so.

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.258
Livers and internal organs
take a bit longer.

00:05:10.282 --> 00:05:11.908
Spine takes several years.

00:05:11.932 --> 00:05:15.463
But at the end of seven years,
not one cell in your body

00:05:15.487 --> 00:05:18.275
remains from what was there
seven years ago.

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.088
The question is:
who then are we? What are we?

00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.123
What is this thing that we hang on?

00:05:23.147 --> 00:05:24.680
That is actually us?

00:05:24.704 --> 00:05:27.812
Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will.

00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:29.973
They're smaller
than the wavelength of light.

00:05:29.997 --> 00:05:31.268
Gas, can't see that.

00:05:31.292 --> 00:05:33.633
Interesting, somebody
mentioned 1600 recently.

00:05:33.657 --> 00:05:37.434
Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called van Helmont.

00:05:38.448 --> 00:05:43.825
It's said to be the most successful ever
invention of a word by a known individual.

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.340
Quite good. He also invented a word
called "blas," meaning astral radiation.

00:05:49.364 --> 00:05:51.253
Didn't catch on, unfortunately.

00:05:51.277 --> 00:05:52.278
(Laughter)

00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:53.373
But well done, him.

00:05:53.397 --> 00:05:55.598
Light -- you can't see light.

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.036
When it's dark, in a vacuum,

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.225
if a person shines a beam of light

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:01.480
straight across your eyes,
you won't see it.

00:06:01.504 --> 00:06:04.348
Slightly technical, some physicists
will disagree with this.

00:06:04.372 --> 00:06:06.713
But it's odd that you can't see
the beam of light,

00:06:06.737 --> 00:06:08.222
you can only see what it hits.

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:09.603
Electricity, can't see that.

00:06:09.627 --> 00:06:12.771
Don't let anyone tell you
they understand electricity, they don't.

00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:13.957
Nobody knows what it is.

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:14.988
(Laughter)

00:06:15.012 --> 00:06:18.520
You probably think the electrons
in an electric wire move instantaneously

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.934
down a wire, don't you,
at the speed of light,

00:06:20.958 --> 00:06:23.030
when you turn the light on, they don't.

00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:24.697
Electrons bumble down the wire,

00:06:24.721 --> 00:06:27.109
about the speed of spreading
honey, they say.

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:28.868
Galaxies -- hundred billion of them,

00:06:28.892 --> 00:06:30.974
estimated in the universe.
Hundred billion.

00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:32.345
How many can we see?

00:06:32.369 --> 00:06:36.041
Five. Five, out of a hundred billion
galaxies, with the naked eye.

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:39.828
And one of them is quite difficult to see,
unless you've got very good eyesight.

00:06:39.852 --> 00:06:41.541
Radio waves. There's another thing.

00:06:41.565 --> 00:06:44.752
Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered
radio waves, in 1887,

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:47.158
he called them radio waves
because they radiated.

00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:50.017
Somebody said to him,
"What's the point of these, Heinrich?

00:06:50.041 --> 00:06:52.750
What's the point of these radio waves
that you've found?"

00:06:52.774 --> 00:06:54.369
And he said, "Well, I've no idea,

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:56.976
but I guess somebody will find
a use for them someday.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.037
The biggest thing that's invisible
to us is what we don't know.

00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:02.974
It is incredible how little we know.

00:07:02.998 --> 00:07:04.297
Thomas Edison once said,

00:07:04.321 --> 00:07:08.924
"We don't know one percent
of one millionth about anything."

00:07:08.948 --> 00:07:12.090
And I've come to the conclusion --

00:07:12.114 --> 00:07:15.584
because you ask this other question:
"What's another thing we can't see?"

00:07:15.608 --> 00:07:17.557
The point, most of us. What's the point?

00:07:17.581 --> 00:07:19.343
The point -- what I've got it down to

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:21.867
is there are only two questions
really worth asking.

00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:22.903
"Why are we here?",

00:07:22.927 --> 00:07:25.448
and "What should
we do about it while we are?"

00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:29.509
To help you, I've got two things to leave
you with, from two great philosophers,

00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:32.819
perhaps two of the greatest philosopher
thinkers of the 20th century.

00:07:32.843 --> 00:07:35.609
One a mathematician and engineer,
and the other a poet.

00:07:35.633 --> 00:07:38.423
The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein,

00:07:38.447 --> 00:07:41.229
who said, "I don't know why we are here,

00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:44.109
but I am pretty sure it's not
in order to enjoy ourselves."

00:07:44.133 --> 00:07:45.165
(Laughter)

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:47.092
He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he?

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:48.282
(Laughter)

00:07:48.306 --> 00:07:53.804
And secondly, and lastly,
W.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets,

00:07:53.828 --> 00:07:58.439
who said, "We are here
on Earth to help others.

00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:01.857
What the others
are here for, I've no idea."

00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:03.400
(Laughter)

00:08:03.424 --> 00:08:06.079
(Applause)

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:07.274
(Circus music)

00:08:07.298 --> 00:08:08.958
[Get your souvenir photo here!]

00:08:08.982 --> 00:08:11.738
[Continue your journey into the unknown!]
