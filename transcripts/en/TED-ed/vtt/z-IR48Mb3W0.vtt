00:00:07.668 --> 00:00:11.309
Depression is the leading cause
of disability in the world.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.382
In the United States,

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:15.683
close to 10% of adults 
struggle with depression.

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.358
But because it's a mental illness,

00:00:17.358 --> 00:00:21.598
it can be a lot harder to understand
than, say, high cholesterol.

00:00:21.598 --> 00:00:25.390
One major source of confusion is
the difference between having depression

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.963
and just feeling depressed.

00:00:27.963 --> 00:00:31.492
Almost everyone feels down
from time to time.

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:32.711
Getting a bad grade,

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:33.808
losing a job,

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:34.831
having an argument,

00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:38.064
even a rainy day can bring on
feelings of sadness.

00:00:38.064 --> 00:00:39.891
Sometimes there's no trigger at all.

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.006
It just pops up out of the blue.

00:00:42.006 --> 00:00:43.549
Then circumstances change,

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:46.206
and those sad feelings disappear.

00:00:46.206 --> 00:00:48.419
Clinical depression is different.

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:49.896
It's a medical disorder,

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:52.778
and it won't go away 
just because you want it to.

00:00:52.778 --> 00:00:55.180
It lingers for at least 
two consecutive weeks,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.783
and significantly interferes 
with one's ability to work,

00:00:58.783 --> 00:00:59.590
play,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.996
or love.

00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.277
Depression can have a lot
of different symptoms:

00:01:03.277 --> 00:01:04.281
a low mood,

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:06.912
loss of interest in things
you'd normally enjoy,

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:08.485
changes in appetite,

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:10.835
feeling worthless or excessively guilty,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.531
sleeping either too much or too little,

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:15.363
poor concentration,

00:01:15.363 --> 00:01:17.198
restlessness or slowness,

00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:18.681
loss of energy,

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.215
or recurrent thoughts of suicide.

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:23.461
If you have at least five
of those symptoms,

00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:25.445
according to psychiatric guidelines,

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:28.924
you qualify for a diagnosis of depression.

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:31.292
And it's not just behavioral symptoms.

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:35.406
Depression has physical manifestations
inside the brain.

00:01:35.406 --> 00:01:36.511
First of all,

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.092
there are changes that could be seen
with the naked eye

00:01:39.092 --> 00:01:40.510
and X-ray vision.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.783
These include smaller frontal lobes
and hippocampal volumes.

00:01:44.783 --> 00:01:46.871
On a more microscale,

00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.351
depression is associated 
with a few things:

00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.241
the abnormal transmission or depletion
of certain neurotransmitters,

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.870
especially serotonin, norepinephrine,
and dopamine,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.628
blunted circadian rhythms,

00:01:58.628 --> 00:02:03.338
or specific changes in the REM
and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle,

00:02:03.338 --> 00:02:05.303
and hormone abnormalities,

00:02:05.303 --> 00:02:10.187
such as high cortisol and deregulation
of thyroid hormones.

00:02:10.187 --> 00:02:12.950
But neuroscientists still don't have
a complete picture

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.101
of what causes depression.

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:20.075
It seems to have to do with a complex
interaction between genes and environment,

00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:21.839
but we don't have a diagnostic tool

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:26.112
that can accurately predict where
or when it will show up.

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.619
And because depression symptoms
are intangible,

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:32.467
it's hard to know who might look fine
but is actually struggling.

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.954
According to the National Institute
of Mental Health,

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.847
it takes the average person
suffering with a mental illness

00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:41.138
over ten years to ask for help.

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:43.115
But there are very effective treatments.

00:02:43.115 --> 00:02:47.611
Medications and therapy complement
each other to boost brain chemicals.

00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:50.631
In extreme cases,
electroconvulsive therapy,

00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.553
which is like a controlled seizure
in the patient's brain,

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.668
is also very helpful.

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:56.989
Other promising treatments,

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.621
like transcranial magnetic stimulation,

00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:01.799
are being investigated, too.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.405
So, if you know someone 
struggling with depression,

00:03:04.405 --> 00:03:08.777
encourage them, gently, to seek out
some of these options.

00:03:08.777 --> 00:03:11.176
You might even offer to help
with specific tasks,

00:03:11.176 --> 00:03:13.291
like looking up therapists in the area,

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:16.026
or making a list of questions
to ask a doctor.

00:03:16.026 --> 00:03:17.689
To someone with depression,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.741
these first steps can seem insurmountable.

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:23.026
If they feel guilty or ashamed,

00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:25.590
point out that depression 
is a medical condition,

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.641
just like asthma or diabetes.

00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:30.274
It's not a weakness 
or a personality trait,

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:33.516
and they shouldn't expect themselves
to just get over it

00:03:33.516 --> 00:03:36.866
anymore than they could will themselves
to get over a broken arm.

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:39.461
If you haven't experienced 
depression yourself,

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.804
avoid comparing it to times
you've felt down.

00:03:42.804 --> 00:03:46.977
Comparing what they're experiencing
to normal, temporary feelings of sadness

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:49.599
can make them feel guilty for struggling.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:52.936
Even just talking about 
depression openly can help.

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:57.315
For example, research shows that asking
someone about suicidal thoughts

00:03:57.315 --> 00:03:59.814
actually reduces their suicide risk.

00:03:59.814 --> 00:04:03.766
Open conversations about mental illness
help erode stigma

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:06.502
and make it easier 
for people to ask for help.

00:04:06.502 --> 00:04:08.293
And the more patients seek treatment,

00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.992
the more scientists will learn
about depression,

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:13.209
and the better the treatments will get.
