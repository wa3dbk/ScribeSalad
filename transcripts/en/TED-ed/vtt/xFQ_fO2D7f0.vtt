[Stories from the Sea]

00:00:21.198 --> 00:00:26.174
[Fish Tale
My Secret Life as Plankton]

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.814
How did I get here?

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:35.557
Well, it's a stranger story
than you might think.

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:40.283
I came from a world of drifters,

00:00:40.307 --> 00:00:42.886
a place few humans have ever seen.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:45.585
The world of plankton.

00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:52.158
I came from a batch of a million eggs,
and only a few of us survived.

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:58.732
When I became a larva,
I moved among other drifters.

00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:04.125
["Plankton" comes from the Greek
"planktos" for wandering]

00:01:08.138 --> 00:01:13.329
My fellow plankton came in all sizes,
from tiny algae and bacteria

00:01:13.353 --> 00:01:15.843
to animals longer than a blue whale.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:25.374
I shared my nursery
with other embryos and juveniles,

00:01:25.398 --> 00:01:29.364
from clams and crabs
to sea urchins and anemones.

00:01:32.445 --> 00:01:33.745
(High pitch sound)

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:37.040
We drifting animals
are called zooplankton.

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:43.045
The most common animals here
are copepods and krill.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.069
(Buzzing)

00:01:46.332 --> 00:01:48.299
You could search the world over,

00:01:48.323 --> 00:01:52.090
but you'd never find a place
more diverse than my childhood home.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.883
A teaspoon of seawater

00:01:55.907 --> 00:01:58.771
can contain more
than a million living creatures.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.914
It can be a pretty tough
existence, though.

00:02:04.938 --> 00:02:09.080
Trillions are born here,
but only a few make it to adulthood.

00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:16.637
He may be no larger than a pin head,

00:02:16.661 --> 00:02:20.517
but this crab larva
is an arrow worm's worst nightmare.

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.980
(Bumping noises)

00:02:32.332 --> 00:02:33.633
(Buzzing)

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:40.434
Epic battles between carnivores
like these are just one way to get food.

00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:46.014
But the real powers
of this place come from phytoplankton.

00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:48.567
Single-celled life

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.374
that transforms sunlight
and carbon dioxide

00:02:51.398 --> 00:02:52.860
into edible gold.

00:03:00.462 --> 00:03:04.608
Phytoplankton are the base
for the largest food web in the world.

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:08.621
During the night,

00:03:08.645 --> 00:03:11.237
many animals like me
would rise up from the depths

00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:14.136
to feed on this sun-powered feast.

00:03:15.056 --> 00:03:16.681
(Maraca sound)

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.732
I was part of the largest daily
migration of life on Earth.

00:03:25.197 --> 00:03:26.760
During the day,

00:03:26.784 --> 00:03:30.927
I'd return to the darkness,
where I'd join my bizarre companions.

00:03:32.682 --> 00:03:34.205
(High pitch buzz)

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.422
(Flapping noises)

00:03:35.446 --> 00:03:38.560
Cannibals, like this
sea butterfly mollusk,

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.261
that eats its next of kin.

00:03:44.983 --> 00:03:46.621
And comb jellies,

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:49.864
that beat cilia like rainbowed eyelashes.

00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:58.752
Some of these snare
their prey with sticky tentacles,

00:03:59.834 --> 00:04:03.192
while others just take
a bite out of their cousins.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.729
And siphonophores

00:04:06.753 --> 00:04:09.341
that catch prey with toxic fishing lures.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:19.024
But my favorite would have
to be the crustacean Phronima.

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:23.568
Its monstrous looks inspired
the movie "Aliens."

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:28.052
It can catch tiny bits in its bristles,

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:30.765
but prefers larger prey like salps.

00:04:34.553 --> 00:04:38.983
With two sets of eyes,
this female prowls the deeper water.

00:04:41.307 --> 00:04:43.114
Prey in hand,

00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:45.796
she performs one
of the strangest behaviors

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.558
in the entire animal kingdom.

00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:53.298
With body parts from her victims,

00:04:53.322 --> 00:04:56.914
she delicately assembles
a barrel-like home

00:04:56.938 --> 00:05:00.651
feeding her young until they can drift off
and survive on their own.

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:09.861
Best of all, they make the perfect
snack for a small fish like me.

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:14.822
Here among the plankton,

00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:18.421
the food web is so tangled and complex,

00:05:18.445 --> 00:05:21.429
even scientists don't know who eats whom.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.233
But I do.

00:05:28.938 --> 00:05:31.794
At least now you know a bit of my story.

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:35.917
There's so much more to me
than just a tasty meal.
