00:00:06.694 --> 00:00:09.979
Right now, you're probably sitting down
to watch this video

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:14.599
and staying seated for a few minutes
to view it is probably okay.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.172
But the longer you stay put,
the more agitated your body becomes.

00:00:19.172 --> 00:00:23.048
It sits there counting down the moments
until you stand up again

00:00:23.048 --> 00:00:25.011
and take it for a walk.

00:00:25.011 --> 00:00:26.711
That may sound ridiculous.

00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.156
Our bodies love to sit, right?

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:30.477
Not really.

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:34.250
Sure, sitting for brief periods 
can help us recover from stress

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.647
or recuperate from exercise.

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:42.206
But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit
much more than we move around,

00:00:42.206 --> 00:00:46.286
and our bodies simply aren't built
for such a sedentary existence.

00:00:46.286 --> 00:00:49.089
In fact, just the opposite is true.

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.653
The human body is built to move,

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:54.841
and you can see evidence of that
in the way it's structured.

00:00:54.841 --> 00:01:00.205
Inside us are over 360 joints,
and about 700 skeletal muscles

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:03.352
that enable easy, fluid motion.

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:07.721
The body's unique physical structure
gives us the ability to stand up straight

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:09.908
against the pull of gravity.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:14.232
Our blood depends on us moving around
to be able to circulate properly.

00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:16.713
Our nerve cells benefit from movement,

00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:21.440
and our skin is elastic, 
meaning it molds to our motions.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.426
So if every inch of the body
is ready and waiting for you to move,

00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:28.798
what happens when you just don't?

00:01:28.798 --> 00:01:32.105
Let's start with the backbone
of the problem, literally.

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:34.128
Your spine is a long structure

00:01:34.128 --> 00:01:38.044
made of bones and the cartilage discs
that sit between them.

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:41.451
Joints, muscles and ligaments
that are attached to the bones

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:43.376
hold it all together.

00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:47.651
A common way of sitting is with a
curved back and slumped shoulders,

00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:51.379
a position that puts uneven
pressure on your spine.

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:55.331
Over time, this causes wear and tear
in your spinal discs,

00:01:55.331 --> 00:01:57.873
overworks certain ligaments and joints,

00:01:57.873 --> 00:02:00.916
and puts strain on muscles that stretch

00:02:00.916 --> 00:02:04.355
to accommodate 
your back's curved position.

00:02:04.355 --> 00:02:08.312
This hunched shape also shrinks
your chest cavity while you sit,

00:02:08.312 --> 00:02:13.322
meaning your lungs have less space
to expand into when you breath.

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:17.234
That's a problem because it temporarily
limits the amount of oxygen

00:02:17.234 --> 00:02:20.931
that fills your lungs
and filters into your blood.

00:02:20.931 --> 00:02:25.694
Around the skeleton are the muscles,
nerves, arteries and veins

00:02:25.694 --> 00:02:28.678
that form the body's soft tissue layers.

00:02:28.678 --> 00:02:33.527
The very act of sitting squashes,
pressurizes and compresses,

00:02:33.527 --> 00:02:37.033
and these more delicate tissues
really feel the brunt.

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:41.282
Have you ever experienced numbness
and swelling in your limbs when you sit?

00:02:41.282 --> 00:02:43.460
In areas that are the most compressed,

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.799
your nerves, arteries and veins
can become blocked,

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.240
which limits nerve signaling,
causing the numbness,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.421
and reduces blood flow in your limbs,
causing them to swell.

00:02:55.421 --> 00:03:00.879
Sitting for long periods also temporarily
deactivates lipoprotein lipase,

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.759
a special enzyme in the walls
of blood capillaries

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:07.362
that breaks down fats in the blood,

00:03:07.362 --> 00:03:13.016
so when you sit, you're not burning fat
nearly as well as when you move around.

00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:16.268
What effect does all of this stasis
have on the brain?

00:03:16.268 --> 00:03:19.512
Most of the time, 
you probably sit down to use your brain,

00:03:19.512 --> 00:03:24.568
but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting
actually run counter to this goal.

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.968
Being stationary reduces blood flow

00:03:26.968 --> 00:03:30.856
and the amount of oxygen entering
your blood stream through your lungs.

00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:34.324
Your brain requires both 
of those things to remain alert,

00:03:34.324 --> 00:03:37.629
so your concentration levels
will most likely dip

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.783
as your brain activity slows.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:45.989
Unfortunately, the ill effects of being
seated don't only exist in the short term.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.625
Recent studies have found 
that sitting for long periods

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:52.322
is linked with some types of cancers
and heart disease

00:03:52.322 --> 00:03:57.107
and can contribute to diabetes,
kidney and liver problems.

00:03:57.107 --> 00:04:00.768
In fact, researchers 
have worked out that, worldwide,

00:04:00.768 --> 00:04:05.773
inactivity causes about 
9% of premature deaths a year.

00:04:05.773 --> 00:04:08.604
That's over 5 million people.

00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:10.704
So what seems like such a harmless habit

00:04:10.704 --> 00:04:14.102
actually has the power 
to change our health.

00:04:14.102 --> 00:04:19.674
But luckily, the solutions to this
mounting threat are simple and intuitive.

00:04:19.674 --> 00:04:21.436
When you have no choice but to sit,

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:25.149
try switching the slouch 
for a straighter spine,

00:04:25.149 --> 00:04:27.540
and when you don't have 
to be bound to your seat,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.396
aim to move around much more,

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:35.571
perhaps by setting a reminder
to yourself to get up every half hour.

00:04:35.571 --> 00:04:41.073
But mostly, just appreciate that bodies
are built for motion, not for stillness.

00:04:41.073 --> 00:04:46.112
In fact, since the video's almost over,
why not stand up and stretch right now?

00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:47.821
Treat your body to a walk.

00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:49.936
It'll thank you later.
