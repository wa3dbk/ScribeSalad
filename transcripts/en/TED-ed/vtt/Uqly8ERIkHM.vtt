00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.445
You know, I had a real rough time
in school with ADD,

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:18.625
and I have a PhD.

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:20.989
I earned a PhD, but ...
tough to pay attention --

00:00:21.013 --> 00:00:24.805
biology, geology, physics,
chemistry -- really tough for me.

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:26.796
Only one thing grabbed my attention,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.231
and it's that planet called Earth.

00:00:30.255 --> 00:00:33.271
But in this picture here,
you'll see that Earth is mostly water.

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:34.446
That's the Pacific.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.704
Seventy percent of Earth
is covered with water.

00:00:36.728 --> 00:00:38.880
You can say, "Hey,
I know Earth. I live here."

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.174
You don't know Earth.

00:00:40.198 --> 00:00:43.437
You don't know this planet,
because most of it's covered with that --

00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:44.666
average depth, two miles.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.870
And when you go outside

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:48.761
and look up at the Empire State
Building, Chrysler Building,

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.014
the average depth of the ocean
is 15 of those on top of one another.

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:55.198
We've explored about five percent
of what's in that water.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:59.002
"Explored," meaning, for the first time,
go peek and see what's there.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:01.622
So what I want to do today
is show you some things

00:01:01.646 --> 00:01:03.939
about this planet, about the oceans.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:06.861
I want to take you from shallow water
down to the deep water,

00:01:06.885 --> 00:01:09.086
and hopefully, like me,
you'll see some things

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.765
that get you hooked
on exploring planet Earth.

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:15.221
You know things like corals;
you've seen plenty of corals,

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:17.607
those of you who've been
to the beach, snorkeling,

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.366
know corals are an amazing place
to go -- full of life,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.241
some big animals, small animals,
some nice, some dangerous,

00:01:23.265 --> 00:01:25.130
sharks, whales, all that stuff.

00:01:25.154 --> 00:01:27.432
They need to be protected from humanity.

00:01:27.456 --> 00:01:28.620
They're great places.

00:01:28.644 --> 00:01:32.313
But what you probably don't know
is in the very deep part of the ocean,

00:01:32.337 --> 00:01:33.625
we have volcanic eruptions.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.269
Most volcanoes on Earth
are at the bottom of the sea --

00:01:36.293 --> 00:01:37.542
more than 80 percent.

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:39.020
And we actually have fire,

00:01:39.044 --> 00:01:41.730
fire deep inside the ocean,
going on right now.

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:45.023
All over the world -- in the Pacific,
the Atlantic, the Indian Ocean.

00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:48.171
In this place, the ocean floor,
the rocks actually turn to liquid.

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:50.354
So you actually have waves
on the ocean floor.

00:01:50.378 --> 00:01:53.379
You'd say nothing could live there,
but when we look in detail,

00:01:53.403 --> 00:01:56.533
even there, in the deepest,
darkest places on Earth, we find life,

00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.908
which tells us that life
really wants to happen.

00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:00.821
So, pretty amazing stuff.

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.869
Every time we go to the bottom of the sea,

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.162
we explore with our submarines,
with our robots,

00:02:05.186 --> 00:02:07.202
we see something
that's usually surprising,

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.857
sometimes it's startling
and sometimes revolutionary.

00:02:09.881 --> 00:02:12.316
You see that puddle
of water sitting there.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.602
And all around the water
there's a little cliff,

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:16.316
there's a little white sandy beach.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.146
We'll get closer, you'll see
the beach a little bit better,

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.250
some of the waves
in that water, down there.

00:02:21.274 --> 00:02:23.242
The thing that's special about this water

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.559
is that it's at the bottom
of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:27.409
So you're sitting inside a submarine,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:31.717
looking out the window
at a little pond of water beneath the sea.

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:35.022
We see ponds, we see
lakes, we see rivers --

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:37.812
in fact, right here is a river
at the bottom of the ocean

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:39.948
going from the lower
left to the upper right.

00:02:39.972 --> 00:02:41.916
Water is actually flowing through there.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.355
This totally blew our minds.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.096
How can you have this at the bottom?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.217
You're in the ocean looking at more water.

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.952
And there's animals
that only live in that water.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.262
So, the bottom of the ocean --

00:02:52.286 --> 00:02:55.152
I love this map, because it shows
in the middle of the ocean,

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.413
there's a mountain range.

00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:59.873
It's the greatest mountain range
on Earth, called the mid-ocean ridge --

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.976
50,000 miles long,
and we've hardly had a peek at it.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.150
Hardly had a peek at it.

00:03:04.174 --> 00:03:07.325
We find valleys,
many thousands of valleys,

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.476
larger, wider, deeper
than the Grand Canyon.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.215
We find, as I said, underwater
lakes, rivers, waterfalls.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.906
The largest waterfall on the planet

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.454
is actually under the ocean,
up near Iceland.

00:03:17.873 --> 00:03:20.745
All that stuff is in that five percent
that we've explored.

00:03:21.333 --> 00:03:23.888
So the deal about the ocean
is that to explore it,

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.760
you've got to have technology.

00:03:25.784 --> 00:03:28.085
Not only technology,
but it's not just Dave Gallo

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.318
or one person exploring,
it's a team of people.

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:32.536
You've got to have the talent, the team.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.194
You've got to have the technology.

00:03:34.218 --> 00:03:37.373
In this case, it's our ship, Atlantis,
and the submarine, Alvin.

00:03:37.397 --> 00:03:39.897
Inside that submarine --
this is an Alvin launch --

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:41.072
there's three people.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.906
They're being wheeled out onto deck.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.140
There's 47 other people,

00:03:44.164 --> 00:03:47.781
the teamwork on that ship,
making sure that these people are okay.

00:03:47.805 --> 00:03:50.663
Everybody in that submarine
is thinking one thing right now:

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:53.566
Should I have gone
to the bathroom one more time?

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.454
Because you're in there for 10 hours --

00:03:55.478 --> 00:03:57.000
10 hours in that little sphere.

00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:59.999
Three of you together
and nobody is going to be around you.

00:04:00.023 --> 00:04:03.207
You go into the water
and once you hit the water, it's amazing.

00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:06.135
There's a lovely color blue
that penetrates right inside you.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.223
You don't hear the surface ship anymore,

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.851
you hear that pinging of a sonar.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:12.311
If you've got an iPhone
you've got sonar on there --

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:15.677
it's that same pinging that goes
down to the bottom and comes back up.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:18.838
Divers check out the sub to make
sure the outside is okay,

00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:20.022
and then they say "Go,"

00:04:20.046 --> 00:04:23.239
and down you go to the bottom
of the ocean and it's an amazing trip.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.976
So for two and a half hours,
you sink down to the bottom.

00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:28.976
And two hours of it
is totally pitch black.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.456
We thought that nothing
could live inside that world

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.793
at the bottom of the ocean.

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:35.396
And when we look,
we find some amazing things.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.643
All the way down --
we call it the mid-water --

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.443
from the top of the ocean
down to the bottom, we find life.

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:42.442
Whenever we stop and look, we find life.

00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:44.141
I'm going to show you some jellies.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:46.908
They're absolutely some
of the coolest creatures on Earth.

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:49.288
Look at that thing,
just flailing his arms around.

00:04:49.312 --> 00:04:50.712
That's like a little lobster.

00:04:50.736 --> 00:04:53.986
That one is like all these animals
with their mouths hooked together,

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.163
the colonial animals.

00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:58.158
Some animals are tiny,
some can be longer than this stage.

00:04:58.182 --> 00:04:59.333
Just amazing animals.

00:04:59.357 --> 00:05:01.273
And you can't collect them with a net --

00:05:01.297 --> 00:05:03.892
we have to go with our cameras
and take a look at them.

00:05:03.916 --> 00:05:06.171
So every time we go, new species of life.

00:05:06.195 --> 00:05:07.664
The ocean is full of life.

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:10.485
And yet the deepest part of the ocean --

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:13.089
when we go to that mountain range,
we find hot springs.

00:05:13.113 --> 00:05:15.557
Now we were sure --
because this is poisonous water,

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.812
because it's so deep
it would crush the Titanic

00:05:17.836 --> 00:05:20.275
the same way you crush
an empty cup in your hand --

00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:22.633
we were sure there would be
no life there at all.

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:25.815
Instead, we find more life
and diversity and density

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.452
than in the tropical rainforest.

00:05:27.476 --> 00:05:30.849
So, in one instance, in one peek
out the window of the sub,

00:05:30.873 --> 00:05:32.024
we discover something

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:34.790
that revolutionizes the way
we think about life on Earth;

00:05:34.814 --> 00:05:37.216
and that is, you don't always
have to have sunlight

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.398
to get life going.

00:05:38.858 --> 00:05:41.692
There's big animals down there too,
some that look familiar.

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.366
That guy's called Dumbo.
I love him. Dumbo's great.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.038
This guy -- oh man,
I wish I had more footage of this.

00:05:47.062 --> 00:05:49.967
We're trying to get an expedition
together to go look at this

00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.976
and maybe in a year we'll have that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.315
Go online and look.

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.409
Vampyroteuthis infernalis.
The vampire squid.

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:57.866
Incredibly cool.

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.700
In the darkness of the deep sea,
he's got glowing tentacles,

00:06:00.724 --> 00:06:04.036
so if I'm coming at you like him,
I put my arms out in the darkness

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.458
so all you see are little
glowing things over here.

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:07.946
Meanwhile, I'm coming at you.

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.121
When he wants to escape,

00:06:09.145 --> 00:06:11.969
he's got these glowing pods
on his butt that look like eyes.

00:06:11.993 --> 00:06:14.036
Glowing eyes on his butt.
How cool is that?

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.236
Just an amazing animal.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.301
(Laughter)

00:06:16.325 --> 00:06:18.640
"Vampire" squid,
because when it gets protective,

00:06:18.664 --> 00:06:20.798
it pulls this black cape
over its whole body,

00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:22.130
and curls up into a ball.

00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:23.521
Outrageous animal.

00:06:24.434 --> 00:06:26.956
This ship, "The Ship of Dreams" --

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.792
a hundred years ago this coming April,

00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:30.974
this ship was supposed
to show up in New York.

00:06:30.998 --> 00:06:32.149
It's the Titanic.

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:34.185
I co-led an expedition
out there last year.

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:36.623
We are learning so much about that ship.

00:06:36.647 --> 00:06:38.966
The Titanic is an interesting
place for biology,

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.123
because animals are moving
in to live on the Titanic.

00:06:42.147 --> 00:06:44.674
Microbes are actually
eating the hull of the Titanic.

00:06:44.698 --> 00:06:48.103
That's where Jack was king of the world
there on the bow of the Titanic.

00:06:48.127 --> 00:06:49.326
So we're doing real good.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.425
And what's exciting to me
is that we're making a virtual Titanic,

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:56.834
so you can sit there at home
with your joystick and your headset on,

00:06:56.858 --> 00:06:59.412
and you can actually explore
the Titanic for yourself.

00:06:59.436 --> 00:07:01.931
That's what we want to do,
make these virtual worlds,

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.268
so it's not Dave Gallo or someone else
exploring the world; it's you.

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:06.672
You explore it for yourself.

00:07:06.696 --> 00:07:08.377
So here's the bottom line:

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:11.257
The oceans are unexplored

00:07:11.281 --> 00:07:13.757
and I can't begin to tell
you how important that is,

00:07:13.781 --> 00:07:15.594
because they're important to us.

00:07:15.618 --> 00:07:18.249
Seven billion people live on this planet

00:07:18.273 --> 00:07:20.134
and all of us are impacted by the sea,

00:07:20.158 --> 00:07:24.674
because the oceans control the air
you breathe, the water you drink,

00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:25.849
the food you eat.

00:07:25.873 --> 00:07:28.222
All those are controlled
in some way by the ocean,

00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:30.697
and this is a thing
that we haven't even explored --

00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:32.062
five percent.

00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:33.910
The thing I want to leave you with is,

00:07:33.934 --> 00:07:36.315
in that five percent,
I showed you some cool stuff.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:37.872
There's a lot more cool stuff --

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:41.984
every dive we go on in the ocean,
we find something new about the sea.

00:07:42.008 --> 00:07:43.749
So what's in that other 95 percent?

00:07:43.773 --> 00:07:46.458
Did we get the exciting stuff
or is there more out there?

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:49.545
And I'm here to tell you
that the ocean is full of surprises.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.776
There's a quote I love by Marcel Proust:

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.311
"The true voyage of exploration
is not so much in seeking new landscapes,"

00:07:55.335 --> 00:07:56.485
which we do,

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:57.712
"but in having new eyes."

00:07:57.736 --> 00:08:00.106
And so I hope today,
by showing you some of this,

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.336
it's given you some new eyes
about this planet,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.439
and for the first time,
I want you to think about it differently.

00:08:05.463 --> 00:08:06.987
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:08:07.012 --> 00:08:10.067
(Applause)
