00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.248
At about six o'clock in the morning
on September 14, 2015,

00:00:11.248 --> 00:00:15.389
scientists witnessed something
no human had ever seen:

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.758
two black holes colliding.

00:00:18.758 --> 00:00:21.549
Both about 30 times as massive
as our Sun,

00:00:21.549 --> 00:00:25.099
they had been orbiting each other
for millions of years.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.569
As they got closer together,

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.710
they circled each other faster and faster.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.626
Finally, they collided and merged
into a single, even bigger, black hole.

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:37.790
A fraction of a second before their crash,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.640
they sent a vibration across the universe
at the speed of light.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.010
And on Earth, billions of years later,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.911
a detector called the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory,

00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:51.020
or LIGO for short,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.439
picked it up.

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.081
The signal only lasted a fifth of a second

00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:59.320
and was the detector's first observation
of gravitational waves.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.481
What are these ripples in space?

00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.510
The answer starts with gravity,

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.491
the force that pulls any 
two objects together.

00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:09.680
That's the case for everything
In the observable universe.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.509
You're pulling on the Earth,
the Moon, the Sun, and every single star,

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.882
and they're pulling on you.

00:01:16.882 --> 00:01:20.802
The more mass something has,
the stronger its gravitational pull.

00:01:20.802 --> 00:01:24.232
The farther away the object,
the lower its pull.

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:27.874
If every mass has an effect
on every other mass in the universe,

00:01:27.874 --> 00:01:29.402
no matter how small,

00:01:29.402 --> 00:01:33.604
then changes in gravity can tell us
about what those objects are doing.

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:36.232
Fluctuations in the gravity
coming from the universe

00:01:36.232 --> 00:01:38.742
are called gravitational waves.

00:01:38.742 --> 00:01:41.392
Gravitational waves move out from 
what caused them,

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:43.103
like ripples on a pond,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.274
getting smaller as they travel farther
from their center.

00:01:46.274 --> 00:01:48.913
But what are they ripples on?

00:01:48.913 --> 00:01:51.594
When Einstein devised 
his Theory of Relativity,

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:55.944
he imagined gravity as a curve
in a surface called space-time.

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:59.663
A mass in space creates a depression
in space-time,

00:01:59.663 --> 00:02:03.583
and a ball rolling across a depression
will curve

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:06.484
like it's being attracted 
to the other mass.

00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:07.604
The bigger the mass,

00:02:07.604 --> 00:02:10.744
the deeper the depression
and the stronger the gravity.

00:02:10.744 --> 00:02:15.213
When the mass making the depression moves,
that sends out ripples in space-time.

00:02:15.213 --> 00:02:17.955
These are gravitationl waves.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:20.836
What would a gravitational wave feel like?

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.304
If our bodies were sensitive enough
to detect them,

00:02:23.304 --> 00:02:26.074
we'd feel like we were 
being stretched sideways

00:02:26.074 --> 00:02:28.235
while being compressed vertically.

00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:29.485
And in the next instant,

00:02:29.485 --> 00:02:33.196
stretched up and down 
while being compressed horizontally,

00:02:33.196 --> 00:02:34.343
sideways,

00:02:34.343 --> 00:02:35.914
then up and down.

00:02:35.914 --> 00:02:38.345
This back and forth would happen
over and over

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.644
as the gravitational wave
passed right through you.

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:45.935
But this happens on such a minute scale
that we can't feel any of it.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:48.976
So we've built detectors 
that can feel it for us.

00:02:48.976 --> 00:02:51.307
That's what the LIGO detectors do.

00:02:51.307 --> 00:02:53.177
And they're not the only ones.

00:02:53.177 --> 00:02:56.735
There are gravitational wave detectors
spread across the world.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:59.535
These L-shaped instruments have long arms,

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:03.215
whose exact length 
is measured with lasers.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:07.365
If the length changes, it could be because
gravitational waves are stretching

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:09.848
and compressing the arms.

00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:13.257
Once the detectors feel 
a gravitational wave,

00:03:13.257 --> 00:03:17.057
scientists can extract information
about the wave's source.

00:03:17.057 --> 00:03:23.037
In a way, detectors like LIGO are
big gravitational wave radios.

00:03:23.037 --> 00:03:26.567
Radio waves are traveling all around you,
but you can't feel them

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:28.658
or hear the music they carry.

00:03:28.658 --> 00:03:32.218
It takes the right kind of 
detector to extract the music.

00:03:32.218 --> 00:03:34.718
LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal,

00:03:34.718 --> 00:03:39.417
which scientists then study for data
about the object that generated it.

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:43.630
They can derive information, 
like its mass and the shape of its orbit.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.058
We can also hear gravitational waves
by playing their signals through speakers,

00:03:48.058 --> 00:03:51.278
just like the music a radio extracts
from radio waves.

00:03:51.278 --> 00:03:56.529
So those two black holes colliding
sounds like this.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:00.128
Scientists call this 
slide whistle-like noise a chirp,

00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:04.629
and it's the signature of any two
objects orbiting into each other.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.109
The black hole collision 
was just one example

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.539
of what gravitational waves can tell us.

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:14.209
Other high-energy astronomical events
will leave gravitational echoes, too.

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.309
The collapse of a star before it
explodes in a supernova,

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.890
or a very dense neutron stars colliding.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.709
Every time we create a new tool
to look at space,

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:26.380
we discover something we didn't expect,

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.552
something that might revolutionize
our understanding of the universe.

00:04:30.552 --> 00:04:32.810
LIGO's no different.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.503
In the short time it's been on,

00:04:34.503 --> 00:04:37.341
LIGO's already revealed surprises,

00:04:37.341 --> 00:04:41.489
like that black holes collide
more often than we ever expected.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.851
It's impossible to say, 
but exciting to imagine,

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:47.792
what revelations may now be propagating
across space

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:52.561
towards our tiny blue planet and
its new way of perceiving the universe.
