00:00:06.391 --> 00:00:10.752
They say that if walls could talk,
each building would have a story to tell,

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:15.843
but few would tell so many fascinating
stories in so many different voices

00:00:15.843 --> 00:00:19.384
as the Hagia Sophia, or holy wisdom.

00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:21.815
Perched at the crossroads 
of continents and cultures,

00:00:21.815 --> 00:00:25.510
it has seen massive changes 
from the name of the city where it stands,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.990
to its own structure and purpose.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.692
And today, the elements
from each era stand

00:00:30.692 --> 00:00:34.011
ready to tell their tales 
to any visitor who will listen.

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.403
Even before you arrive at the Hagia Sophia,
the ancient fortifications

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:41.393
hint at the strategic importance 
of the surrounding city,

00:00:41.393 --> 00:00:46.357
founded as Byzantium 
by Greek colonists in 657 BCE.

00:00:46.357 --> 00:00:50.811
And successfully renamed as 
Augusta Antonia, New Rome and Constantinople

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:54.398
as it was conquered, reconquered,
destroyed and rebuilt

00:00:54.398 --> 00:00:59.740
by various Greek, Persian and 
Roman rulers over the following centuries.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.396
And it was within these walls that 
the first Megale Ekklesia, or great church,

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.494
was built in the fourth century.

00:01:06.494 --> 00:01:08.746
Though it was soon burned
to the ground in riots,

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:11.822
it established the location for
the region's main religious structure

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:13.963
for centuries to come.

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:16.470
Near the entrance,
the marble stones with reliefs

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.127
are the last reminders 
of the second church.

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:24.306
Built in 415 CE, it was destroyed 
during the Nika Riots of 532

00:01:24.306 --> 00:01:26.326
when angry crowds at a chariot race

00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:29.593
nearly overthrew the emperor, 
Justinian the First.

00:01:29.593 --> 00:01:31.718
Having barely managed to retain power,

00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:35.059
he resolved to rebuild the church
on a grander scale,

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:39.819
and five years later, the edifice 
you see before you was completed.

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.966
As you step inside, the stones 
of the foundation and walls

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:46.573
murmur tales from their homelands
of Egypt and Syria,

00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:51.860
while columns taken from the Temple
of Artemis recall a more ancient past.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.226
Runic inscriptions carved by the 
Vikings of the emperor's elite guard

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.641
carry the lore of distant northern lands.

00:01:57.641 --> 00:02:02.696
But your attention is caught by 
the grand dome, representing the heavens.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:06.954
Reaching over 50 meters high and 
over 30 meters in diameter

00:02:06.954 --> 00:02:09.589
and ringed by windows around its base,

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.348
the golden dome appears
suspended from heaven,

00:02:12.348 --> 00:02:15.013
light reflecting through its interior.

00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:19.253
Beneath its grandiose symbolism,
the sturdy reinforcing Corinthian columns,

00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:22.914
brought from Lebanon after 
the original dome was partially destroyed

00:02:22.914 --> 00:02:25.651
by an earthquake in 558 CE,

00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:27.691
quietly remind you of its fragility

00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:31.278
and the engineering skills
such a marvel requires.

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:34.337
If a picture is worth a thousand words,

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:37.416
the mosaics from the next several 
centuries have the most to say

00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:39.890
not only about their Biblical themes,

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.964
but also the Byzantine emperors who commissioned them,

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.438
often depicted along with Christ.

00:02:45.438 --> 00:02:47.481
But beneath their loud and clear voices,

00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:51.845
one hears the haunting echoes of 
the damaged and missing mosaics and icons,

00:02:51.845 --> 00:02:56.131
desecrated and looted during 
the Latin Occupation in the Fourth Crusade.

00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.933
Within the floor, the tomb inscription
of Enrico Dandolo,

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:02.382
the Venetian ruler who 
commanded the campaign,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:08.109
is a stark reminder of those 57 years that Hagia Sophia spent as a Roman Catholic church

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.009
before returning to its orthodox roots
upon the Byzantine Reconquest.

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.227
But it would not remain a church for long.

00:03:15.227 --> 00:03:19.873
Weakened by the Crusades, Constantinople
fell to the Ottomans in 1453

00:03:19.873 --> 00:03:22.452
and would be known as Istanbul thereafter.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.828
After allowing his soldiers
three days of pillage,

00:03:24.828 --> 00:03:27.474
Sultan Mehmed the Second 
entered the building.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:30.579
Though heavily damaged, 
its grandeur was not lost

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.866
on the young sultan who immediately
rededicated it to Allah,

00:03:33.866 --> 00:03:37.326
proclaiming that it would be
the new imperial mosque.

00:03:37.326 --> 00:03:39.462
The four minarets built 
over the next century

00:03:39.462 --> 00:03:41.571
are the most obvious sign of this era,

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:45.669
serving as architectural supports 
in addition to their religious purpose.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.128
But there are many others.

00:03:47.128 --> 00:03:50.750
Ornate candle holders relate 
Suleiman's conquest of Hungary,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.283
while giant caligraphy discs 
hung from the ceiling

00:03:53.283 --> 00:03:57.625
remind visitors for the first 
four caliphs who followed Muhammad.

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:02.666
Though the building you see today still
looks like a mosque, it is now a museum,

00:04:02.666 --> 00:04:06.698
a decision made in 1935 by Kemal Ataturk,

00:04:06.698 --> 00:04:08.798
the modernizing first president of Turkey

00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:11.608
following the Ottoman Empire's collapse.

00:04:11.608 --> 00:04:15.158
It was this secularization
that allowed for removal

00:04:15.158 --> 00:04:17.863
of the carpets hiding 
the marble floor decorations

00:04:17.863 --> 00:04:20.639
and the plaster covering 
the Christian mosaics.

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.614
Ongoing restoration work 
has allowed the multiplicity of voices

00:04:24.614 --> 00:04:26.490
in Hagia Sophia's long history

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.336
to be heard again after
centuries of silence.

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:31.071
But conflict remains.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.471
Hidden mosaics cry out from 
beneath Islamic calligraphy,

00:04:34.471 --> 00:04:38.966
valuable pieces of history that cannot be
uncovered without destroying others.

00:04:38.966 --> 00:04:42.653
Meanwhile, calls sound from
both Muslim and Christian communities

00:04:42.653 --> 00:04:45.930
to return the building to 
its former religious purposes.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.203
The story of the divine wisdom 
may be far from over,

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:52.624
but one can only hope that 
the many voices residing there

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:55.704
will be able to tell their part
for years to come.
