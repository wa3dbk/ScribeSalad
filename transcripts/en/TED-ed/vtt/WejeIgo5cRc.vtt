00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.520
So how many of you have a robot at home?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.856
OK, I see about 20, 30 hands.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.536
That's actually pretty good.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.160
How many of you would want
your own personal robot at home?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.096
I know I would!

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.456
OK, so why doesn't this exist?

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.176
Why can't I go to the convenience store
or the department store and, you know,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.176
go up to the cashier and say,
"Yeah, I want my personal robot"?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.096
Well, I'm going to talk to you
about how to make that happen.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.096
The thing that we need to do
is to make robots smarter.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.856
Now, no one will argue
that we don't have robots.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.696
We have rovers that are going to Mars
and are getting science data

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.096
and expanding our
understanding of the world.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.536
We have manufacturing robots

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.376
that are helping to build our cars
that we drive today.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.896
We even have robots
that are helping our military,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.896
that are out disposing of bombs

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.496
so our soldiers can come home safely.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.416
So we have all this,
so why don't we have the personal robot?

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.202
Why don't I have my robot chef?
Because I can't cook.

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:13.336
(Laughter)

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.496
So, here's one of my robots,
this is a simple walking robot,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.936
but it is by no means smart.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.376
And so, what we need to do is

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.776
we need to change the definition
of what a robot is.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.705
How do we do that? Well, the first step,

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.736
before we even start designing
and getting our hands dirty,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.976
we have to come up with rules,
kind of the laws, rules of conduct.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.016
And why is this?
Because if these robots are smart,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.056
they might be capable
of more than we want.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.896
And so we have to come up with rules.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.056
Thou, robot, shall not harm a human.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.799
Thou shall obey me, and only me.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.696
Thou shall always protect me
at all possible times.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.016
So we have to lay the boundaries,
the rules of engagement,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.896
before we actually start designing.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.816
And then we have to come up with tools.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.576
So I believe that the way
to make robots smarter

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.856
is to mimic people.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.976
Now, our brains are complex,
there's a lot going on in there,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.496
and so, it'd be hard
to try to open up the brain

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.616
and actually figure out
how to mimic humans.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:13.776
The best way is to observe,
is to actually watch people do things,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.856
and figure out what are they doing,
what are their thoughts,

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.136
what are their actions,
what are their emotions?

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.456
And so, part of making robots smarter
is actually trying to mimic humans,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.856
mimic how we do things,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.976
so maybe they can do it
a little bit better.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.496
And so, some of the tools are varied.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.256
And so, I'm classically trained
as an electrical engineer.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.256
I never thought I'd have to understand
things like child psychology,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.496
infant development.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.216
So, understanding that the way
infants develop to children,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.616
develop to adults,
and how they learn and interact

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.816
is actually important for robotics.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.256
I didn't understand
that I'd actually have to watch

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.816
tapes of monkeys
interacting and communicating,

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.936
because they have
a whole social kind of mechanism

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.576
where they learn from each other,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.936
and so that's really good
to make robots smarter.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.376
And, of course, neuroscience,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.576
I've always been fascinated
with neuroscience,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.816
but I never understood
that I had to figure out

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.022
why do the neurons fire,

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:08.416
what about the environment
helps us to learn,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.696
and all of those really contribute
to making robots a little bit smarter.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.376
And so, some of the things that I do --
and this is just a little snapshot --

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.936
one of the things is mirroring.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.856
So they say our ability
to look in a mirror and wave

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.736
and actually recognize
that the person on the other side is us,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.136
that self-awareness,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.656
is a sign of intelligence,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.656
and that allows us
to then look at someone pitch a ball

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.936
and figure out,
"OK, I know how to pitch a ball,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.016
I'm going to mirror their improvement."

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.496
And so I actually have a robot

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.936
where we are trying to design
a robot health coach.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.856
And so, I have an exercise physiologist

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.456
showing the robot
how to do some exercises.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.056
You know, we want to get strong.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.936
And then, the other thing is learning.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.336
So, learning is important.
We do this as children,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.576
we do this even as adults,
we do this as elder.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.616
And yet, one form of learning
is muscle memory.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.176
So how many of you play an instrument?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.496
OK, so when you start off, for example,
if you think about the violin,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.016
you start off and your instructor
might actually come

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.376
and move your hand a little bit
or maybe move your bow a little bit up.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.376
So they actually touch you
in order to give you muscle memory.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.376
And that helps you understand
how to do things a little better.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.576
And so we actually
have a learning methodology

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.886
where of course, we're not going
to take the motors and move the legs,

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.976
and so we have to Nunchuk
to give our robot muscle memory

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.936
in terms of how to do dance moves.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.776
And then, lastly, is creativity.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.176
So, you might ask,
"Robots? Creativity? I don't get this.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.096
Why does the robot have to be creative?
What about creativity makes them smarter?"

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.896
Well, creativity and imagination,

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.056
those are the things
that allow us to create problems

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.816
when we don't know how to attack it.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.056
They allow us to make
something out of nothing.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.216
I mean, if you look at the apps
that at out there and the tablets,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.656
and the iPads, and the iPhones,
and the Androids --

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.336
20 years ago they didn't exist.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.336
So, how is it that we got from something
where there was nothing and expanded?

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.776
It was our imagination.
It was our creativity.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.816
And these are the things
that allow us to figure out new things.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.656
And so, I have a robot that is creative,

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.736
it plays piano, is a composer,

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.976
and if you listen, it plays
"Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star."

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.216
(Music)

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.496
So, all of this together,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.640
the last thing is interaction.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.456
So, you have a robot,
you want it to be your playmate,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.456
your teacher, your instructor,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.456
you want it to interact.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.840
And isn't it so cute?

00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:27.569
(Laughter)

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.136
So, interaction is key,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.736
it is key to understanding
how to work in our world with us,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.056
and so the interaction piece
is very important.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.136
It deals with communication,
it deals with understanding,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.976
it deals with gaze,
it deals with attention.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.016
All of these things together
allow that interaction

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.376
and our robots to be smart.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.296
And so these are just some of the tools

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.416
that we use in order
to make robots smarter.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.616
So, I want to leave you with one thought.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.296
So, I'm all for robots and smart robots.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.536
I mean, that's what I do,

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.976
I'd be out of a job
if I didn't believe in that.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.096
But yet, where does it end?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.016
How far do we push it?

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.200
How far and how smart
should we make our smart robots?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.056
Thank you.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.360
(Applause)
