00:00:06.794 --> 00:00:09.803
This is the story 
of three plastic bottles,

00:00:09.803 --> 00:00:11.740
empty and discarded.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.949
Their journeys are about to diverge

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:18.546
with outcomes that impact nothing less
than the fate of the planet.

00:00:18.546 --> 00:00:20.731
But they weren't always this way.

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:25.938
To understand where these bottles end up,
we must first explore their origins.

00:00:25.938 --> 00:00:29.688
The heroes of our story
were conceived in this oil refinery.

00:00:29.688 --> 00:00:31.358
The plastic in their bodies

00:00:31.358 --> 00:00:35.692
was formed by chemically bonding 
oil and gas molecules together

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.495
to make monomers.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:43.112
In turn, these monomers were bonded
into long polymer chains to make plastic

00:00:43.112 --> 00:00:46.610
in the form of millions of pellets.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.692
Those were melted at manufacturing plants
and reformed in molds

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:55.228
to create the resilient material
that makes up the triplets' bodies.

00:00:55.228 --> 00:00:58.205
Machines filled the bottles
with sweet bubbily liquid

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:02.288
and they were then wrapped, shipped,
bought, opened, consumed

00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:05.501
and unceremoniously discarded.

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:06.970
And now here they lie,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.283
poised at the edge of the unknown.

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:14.550
Bottle one, like hundreds of millions
of tons of his plastic brethren,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.761
ends up in a landfill.

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:19.235
This huge dump expands each day

00:01:19.235 --> 00:01:23.633
as more trash comes in
and continues to take up space.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.931
As plastics sit there being compressed
amongst layers of other junk,

00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.081
rainwater flows through the waste

00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:34.074
and absorbs the water-soluble 
compounds it contains,

00:01:34.074 --> 00:01:36.926
and some of those are highly toxic.

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:41.006
Together, they create a harmful stew
called leachate,

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:44.471
which can move into groundwater, 
soil and streams,

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:48.102
poisoning ecosystems and harming wildlife.

00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:54.014
It can take bottle one an agonizing
1,000 years to decompose.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:58.509
Bottle two's journey is stranger
but, unfortunately, no happier.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.560
He floats on a trickle 
that reaches a stream,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.558
a stream that flows into a river,

00:02:03.558 --> 00:02:06.674
and a river that reaches the ocean.

00:02:06.674 --> 00:02:08.465
After months lost at sea,

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:13.417
he's slowly drawn into a massive vortex,
where trash accumulates,

00:02:13.417 --> 00:02:17.722
a place known as 
the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:22.304
Here the ocean's currents have trapped
millions of pieces of plastic debris.

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:27.342
This is one of five plastic-filled
gyres in the world's seas.

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:32.168
Places where the pollutants
turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup.

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:35.984
Some animals, like seabirds, 
get entangled in the mess.

00:02:35.984 --> 00:02:41.321
They, and others, mistake the brightly
colored plastic bits for food.

00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:44.660
Plastic makes them feel full 
when they're not,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.581
so they starve to death

00:02:46.581 --> 00:02:50.343
and pass the toxins from the plastic
up the food chain.

00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:52.938
For example, it's eaten by lanternfish,

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.126
the lanternfish are eaten by squid,

00:02:55.126 --> 00:02:57.114
the squid are eaten by tuna,

00:02:57.114 --> 00:03:00.133
and the tuna are eaten by us.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.504
And most plastics don't biodegrade,

00:03:02.504 --> 00:03:06.521
which means they're destined to break down
into smaller and smaller pieces

00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.610
called micro plastics,

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.750
which might rotate in the sea eternally.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.379
But bottle three is spared the cruel
purgatories of his brothers.

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:19.177
A truck brings him to a plant

00:03:19.177 --> 00:03:22.068
where he and his companions 
are squeezed flat

00:03:22.068 --> 00:03:24.704
and compressed into a block.

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.944
Okay, this sounds pretty bad, too,
but hang in there.

00:03:27.944 --> 00:03:29.395
It gets better.

00:03:29.395 --> 00:03:32.183
The blocks are shredded
into tiny pieces,

00:03:32.183 --> 00:03:33.859
which are washed and melted,

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.896
so they become the raw materials
that can be used again.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:42.038
As if by magic, bottle three
is now ready to be reborn

00:03:42.038 --> 00:03:44.486
as something completely new.

00:03:44.486 --> 00:03:47.908
For this bit of plastic
with such humble origins,

00:03:47.908 --> 00:03:50.902
suddenly the sky is the limit.
