00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.415
In 1965, 17-year-old high school student,
Randy Gardner

00:00:12.415 --> 00:00:16.042
stayed awake for 264 hours.

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:20.060
That's 11 days to see how
he'd cope without sleep.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.241
On the second day, 
his eyes stopped focusing.

00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:27.350
Next, he lost the ability
to identify objects by touch.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.917
By day three, Gardner was moody
and uncoordinated.

00:00:30.917 --> 00:00:33.806
At the end of the experiment,
he was struggling to concentrate,

00:00:33.806 --> 00:00:35.607
had trouble with short-term memory,

00:00:35.607 --> 00:00:37.107
became paranoid,

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:39.011
and started hallucinating.

00:00:39.011 --> 00:00:41.741
Although Gardner recovered without
long-term psychological

00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:43.409
or physical damage,

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.100
for others, losing shuteye can result
in hormonal imbalance,

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.192
illness,

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:50.601
and, in extreme cases, death.

00:00:50.601 --> 00:00:55.027
We're only beginning to understand
why we sleep to begin with,

00:00:55.027 --> 00:00:56.965
but we do know it's essential.

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.916
Adults need seven to eight hours
of sleep a night,

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.170
and adolescents need about ten.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.679
We grow sleepy due to signals
from our body

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:06.986
telling our brain we are tired,

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:10.512
and signals from the environment
telling us it's dark outside.

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:12.881
The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals,

00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:15.136
like adenosine and melatonin,

00:01:15.136 --> 00:01:18.348
send us into a light doze 
that grows deeper,

00:01:18.348 --> 00:01:20.951
making our breathing 
and heart rate slow down

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.577
and our muscles relax.

00:01:23.577 --> 00:01:27.075
This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:30.481
and our bodies replenish themselves
for the day ahead.

00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.061
In the United States,

00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:36.681
it's estimated that 30% of adults
and 66% of adolescents

00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:39.124
are regularly sleep-deprived.

00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:41.503
This isn't just a minor inconvenience.

00:01:41.503 --> 00:01:44.841
Staying awake can cause 
serious bodily harm.

00:01:44.841 --> 00:01:46.159
When we lose sleep,

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.004
learning,

00:01:47.004 --> 00:01:47.828
memory,

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:48.538
mood,

00:01:48.538 --> 00:01:50.783
and reaction time are affected.

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:53.385
Sleeplessness may also cause inflammation,

00:01:53.385 --> 00:01:54.607
halluciations,

00:01:54.607 --> 00:01:55.957
high blood pressure,

00:01:55.957 --> 00:02:00.424
and it's even been linked
to diabetes and obesity.

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:03.906
In 2014, a devoted soccer fan died

00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:08.091
after staying awake for 48 hours 
to watch the World Cup.

00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:10.822
While his untimely death 
was due to a stroke,

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:14.614
studies show that chronically sleeping
fewer than six hours a night

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:18.598
increases stroke risk 
by four and half times

00:02:18.598 --> 00:02:22.936
compared to those getting a consistent
seven to eight hours of shuteye.

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:27.556
For a handful of people on the planet who
carry a rare inherited genetic mutation,

00:02:27.556 --> 00:02:30.063
sleeplessness is a daily reality.

00:02:30.063 --> 00:02:34.136
This condition, 
known as Fatal Familial Insomnia,

00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:37.609
places the body in a nightmarish 
state of wakefulness,

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.915
forbidding it from entering 
the sanctuary of sleep.

00:02:40.915 --> 00:02:42.746
Within months or years,

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:47.494
this progressively worsening condition
leads to dementia and death.

00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:51.325
How can sleep deprivation
cause such immense suffering?

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:55.308
Scientists think the answer lies
with the accumulation of waste prducts

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:56.915
in the brain.

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:58.482
During our waking hours,

00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:01.724
our cells are busy using up
our day's energy sources,

00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:04.385
which get broken down 
into various byproducts,

00:03:04.385 --> 00:03:06.673
including adenosine.

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:08.457
As adenosine builds up,

00:03:08.457 --> 00:03:12.913
it increases the urge to sleep,
also known as sleep pressure.

00:03:12.913 --> 00:03:18.273
In fact, caffeine works by blocking
adenosine's receptor pathways.

00:03:18.273 --> 00:03:20.969
Other waste products 
also build up in the brain,

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.986
and if they're not cleared away,
they collectively overload the brain

00:03:24.986 --> 00:03:29.536
and are thought to lead to the many
negative symptoms of sleep deprivation.

00:03:29.536 --> 00:03:33.938
So, what's happening in our brain
when we sleep to prevent this?

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:37.246
Scientists found something called
the glymphatic system,

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:40.355
a clean-up mechanism 
that removes this buildup

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:43.219
and is much more active when we're asleep.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:48.645
It works by using cerebrospinal fluid
to flush away toxic byproducts

00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.997
that accumulate between cells.

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:54.970
Lymphatic vessels, 
which serve as pathways for immune cells,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.866
have recently been discovered 
in the brain,

00:03:57.866 --> 00:04:03.951
and they may also play a role in clearing
out the brain's daily waste products.

00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:08.966
While scientists continue exploring
the restorative mechanisms behind sleep,

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:13.202
we can be sure that slipping 
into slumber is a necessity

00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:16.930
if we want to maintain our health
and our sanity.
