00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.030
In many ways, 
our memories make us who we are,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.059
helping us remember our past,

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.989
learn and retain skills,

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:16.273
and plan for the future.

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:19.916
And for the computers that often act
as extensions of ourselves,

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.126
memory plays much the same role,

00:00:22.126 --> 00:00:23.711
whether it's a two-hour movie,

00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:25.283
a two-word text file,

00:00:25.283 --> 00:00:27.833
or the instructions for opening either,

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:33.372
everything in a computer's memory
takes the form of basic units called bits,

00:00:33.372 --> 00:00:35.846
or binary digits.

00:00:35.846 --> 00:00:38.387
Each of these is stored in a memory cell

00:00:38.387 --> 00:00:42.185
that can switch between two states
for two possible values,

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:44.057
0 and 1.

00:00:44.057 --> 00:00:47.177
Files and programs consist of millions
of these bits,

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:50.428
all processed in 
the central processing unit,

00:00:50.428 --> 00:00:51.746
or CPU,

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:54.096
that acts as the computer's brain.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:58.671
And as the number of bits needing
to be processed grows exponentially,

00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:01.532
computer designers face 
a constant struggle

00:01:01.532 --> 00:01:05.295
between size, cost, and speed.

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:10.126
Like us, computers have short-term memory
for immediate tasks,

00:01:10.126 --> 00:01:13.407
and long-term memory 
for more permanent storage.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:15.277
When you run a program,

00:01:15.277 --> 00:01:18.950
your operating system allocates area
within the short-term memory

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.845
for performing those instructions.

00:01:20.845 --> 00:01:24.392
For example, when you press a key
in a word processor,

00:01:24.392 --> 00:01:29.536
the CPU will access one of these locations
to retrieve bits of data.

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:33.861
It could also modify them,
or create new ones.

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:38.258
The time this takes is known 
as the memory's latency.

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:43.801
And because program instructions must be
processed quickly and continuously,

00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:48.563
all locations within the short-term memory
can be accessed in any order,

00:01:48.563 --> 00:01:51.714
hence the name random access memory.

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:55.900
The most common type of RAM 
is dynamic RAM, or DRAM.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.989
There, each memory cell consists
of a tiny transistor and a capacitor

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.987
that store electrical charges,

00:02:02.987 --> 00:02:07.555
a 0 when there's no charge,
or a 1 when charged.

00:02:07.555 --> 00:02:09.167
Such memory is called dynamic

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:13.380
because it only holds charges briefly
before they leak away,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.759
requiring periodic recharging
to retain data.

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:20.006
But even its low latency 
of 100 nanoseconds

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.651
is too long for modern CPUs,

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.563
so there's also a small, 
high-speed internal memory cache

00:02:26.563 --> 00:02:28.513
made from static RAM.

00:02:28.513 --> 00:02:31.722
That's usually made up 
of six interlocked transistors

00:02:31.722 --> 00:02:33.624
which don't need refreshing.

00:02:33.624 --> 00:02:36.779
SRAM is the fastest memory 
in a computer system,

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.680
but also the most expensive,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.414
and takes up three times 
more space than DRAM.

00:02:42.414 --> 00:02:46.597
But RAM and cache can only hold data
as long as they're powered.

00:02:46.597 --> 00:02:49.625
For data to remain
once the device is turned off,

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.005
it must be transferred 
into a long-term storage device,

00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:55.291
which comes in three major types.

00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:57.739
In magnetic storage, 
which is the cheapest,

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.560
data is stored as a magnetic pattern on
a spinning disc coated with magnetic film.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.203
But because the disc must rotate 
to where the data is located

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:08.621
in order to be read,

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:14.510
the latency for such drives is 100,000 
times slower than that of DRAM.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.626
On the other hand, optical-based storage
like DVD and Blu-ray

00:03:18.626 --> 00:03:20.621
also uses spinning discs,

00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:22.813
but with a reflective coating.

00:03:22.813 --> 00:03:28.029
Bits are encoded as light and dark spots
using a dye that can be read by a laser.

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.151
While optical storage media are cheap
and removable,

00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.878
they have even slower latencies 
than magnetic storage

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:37.236
and lower capacity as well.

00:03:37.236 --> 00:03:42.871
Finally, the newest and fastest types of
long-term storage are solid-state drives,

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:44.025
like flash sticks.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:45.957
These have no moving parts,

00:03:45.957 --> 00:03:48.627
instead using floating gate transistors

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:53.134
that store bits by trapping 
or removing electrical charges

00:03:53.134 --> 00:03:56.453
within their specially designed 
internal structures.

00:03:56.453 --> 00:03:59.739
So how reliable 
are these billions of bits?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.463
We tend to think of computer memory
as stable and permanent,

00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:06.363
but it actually degrades fairly quickly.

00:04:06.363 --> 00:04:09.000
The heat generated from a device
and its environment

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.739
will eventually demagnetize hard drives,

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.991
degrade the dye in optical media,

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:17.115
and cause charge leakage 
in floating gates.

00:04:17.115 --> 00:04:20.081
Solid-state drives 
also have an additional weakness.

00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:24.095
Repeatedly writing to floating gate 
transistors corrodes them,

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.705
eventually rendering them useless.

00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:29.215
With data on most current storage media

00:04:29.215 --> 00:04:31.958
having less than 
a ten-year life expectancy,

00:04:31.958 --> 00:04:36.333
scientists are working to exploit
the physical properties of materials

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.649
down to the quantum level

00:04:38.649 --> 00:04:40.998
in the hopes of making 
memory devices faster,

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:42.063
smaller,

00:04:42.063 --> 00:04:43.609
and more durable.

00:04:43.609 --> 00:04:49.045
For now, immortality remains out of reach,
for humans and computers alike.
