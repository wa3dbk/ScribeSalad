00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:12.117
When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin,

00:00:12.117 --> 00:00:14.890
it affects each of us 
a little differently.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.235
Depending on skin color, it will take
only minutes of exposure

00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:20.585
to turn one person beetroot-pink,

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:24.783
while another requires hours to experience
the slightest change.

00:00:24.783 --> 00:00:26.831
So what's to account for that difference

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:31.721
and how did our skin come to take on
so many different hues to begin with?

00:00:31.721 --> 00:00:32.976
Whatever the color,

00:00:32.976 --> 00:00:38.323
our skin tells an epic tale 
of human intrepidness and adaptability,

00:00:38.323 --> 00:00:42.922
revealing its variance to be 
a function of biology.

00:00:42.922 --> 00:00:44.634
It all centers around melanin,

00:00:44.634 --> 00:00:47.944
the pigment that gives 
skin and hair its color.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:51.192
This ingredient comes from skin cells
called melanocytes

00:00:51.192 --> 00:00:53.485
and takes two basic forms.

00:00:53.485 --> 00:00:57.637
There's eumelanin, which gives rise
to a range of brown skin tones,

00:00:57.637 --> 00:01:00.823
as well as black, brown, and blond hair,

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:06.000
and pheomelanin, which causes the
reddish browns of freckles and red hair.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.518
But humans weren't always like this.

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:12.310
Our varying skin tones were formed
by an evolutionary process

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.435
driven by the Sun.

00:01:14.435 --> 00:01:19.556
In began some 50,000 years ago when our
ancestors migrated north from Africa

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:22.356
and into Europe and Asia.

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:27.544
These ancient humans lived between
the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn,

00:01:27.544 --> 00:01:31.372
a region saturated 
by the Sun's UV-carrying rays.

00:01:31.372 --> 00:01:34.908
When skin is exposed to UV for long
periods of time,

00:01:34.908 --> 00:01:38.287
the UV light damages 
the DNA within our cells,

00:01:38.287 --> 00:01:40.634
and skin starts to burn.

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:42.342
If that damage is severe enough,

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:44.980
the cells mutations can lead to melanoma,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.687
a deadly cancer that forms 
in the skin's melanocytes.

00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:53.901
Sunscreen as we know it today
didn't exist 50,000 years ago.

00:01:53.901 --> 00:01:58.179
So how did our ancestors cope 
with this onslaught of UV?

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.749
The key to survival lay 
in their own personal sunscreen

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.166
manufactured beneath the skin: melanin.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.613
The type and amount 
of melanin in your skin

00:02:07.613 --> 00:02:11.637
determines whether you'll be more or less
protected from the sun.

00:02:11.637 --> 00:02:15.373
This comes down to the skin's response
as sunlight strikes it.

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:17.334
When it's exposed to UV light,

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:21.070
that triggers special light-sensitive 
receptors called rhodopsin,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.637
which stimulate the production of melanin
to shield cells from damage.

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:30.598
For light-skin people, that extra melanin
darkens their skin and produces a tan.

00:02:30.598 --> 00:02:33.264
Over the course of generations,

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:36.643
humans living at 
the Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:39.959
adapted to have a higher 
melanin production threshold

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.917
and more eumelanin,

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:44.592
giving skin a darker tone.

00:02:44.592 --> 00:02:48.036
This built-in sun shield helped protect
them from melanoma,

00:02:48.036 --> 00:02:50.388
likely making them evolutionarily fitter

00:02:50.388 --> 00:02:55.127
and capable of passing this useful trait
on to new generations.

00:02:55.127 --> 00:03:00.137
But soon, some of our Sun-adapted
ancestors migrated northward

00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:01.718
out of the tropical zone,

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:04.678
spreading far and wide across the Earth.

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:08.316
The further north they traveled,
the less direct sunshine they saw.

00:03:08.316 --> 00:03:12.211
This was a problem because 
although UV light can damage skin,

00:03:12.211 --> 00:03:15.269
it also has an important parallel benefit.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.227
UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D,

00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:22.251
an ingredient that strengthens bones
and lets us absorb vital minerals,

00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:26.384
like calcium, iron, magnesium, 
phosphate, and zinc.

00:03:26.384 --> 00:03:30.524
Without it, humans experience serious
fatigue and weakened bones

00:03:30.524 --> 00:03:33.783
that can cause a condition 
known as rickets.

00:03:33.783 --> 00:03:37.706
For humans whose dark skin effectively
blocked whatever sunlight there was,

00:03:37.706 --> 00:03:42.057
vitamin D deficiency would have posed
a serious threat in the north.

00:03:42.057 --> 00:03:44.656
But some of them happened to produce
less melanin.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:49.232
They were exposed to small enough amounts
of light that melanoma was less likely,

00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:53.347
and their lighter skin 
better absorbed the UV light.

00:03:53.347 --> 00:03:55.438
So they benefited from vitamin D,

00:03:55.438 --> 00:03:56.666
developed strong bones,

00:03:56.666 --> 00:04:00.657
and survived well enough to produce
healthy offspring.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.715
Over many generations of selection,

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.997
skin color in those regions
gradually lightened.

00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:09.509
As a result of 
our ancestor's adaptability,

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:13.828
today the planet is full of people
with a vast palette of skin colors,

00:04:13.828 --> 00:04:19.165
typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin
in the hot, sunny band around the Equator,

00:04:19.165 --> 00:04:23.869
and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich
skin shades fanning outwards

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:26.211
as the sunshine dwindles.

00:04:26.211 --> 00:04:30.461
Therefore, skin color is little more than
an adaptive trait for living on a rock

00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:32.551
that orbits the Sun.

00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:34.196
It may absorb light,

00:04:34.196 --> 00:04:37.146
but it certainly does not 
reflect character.
