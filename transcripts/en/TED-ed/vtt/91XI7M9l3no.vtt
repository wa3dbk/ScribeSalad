00:00:18.708 --> 00:00:20.792
As 1905 dawned,

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:27.370
the soon-to-be 26-year-old Albert Einstein
faced life as a failed academic.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.486
Most physicists of the time
would have scoffed at the idea

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:35.015
that this minor civil servant
could have much to contribute to science.

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:36.809
Yet within the following year,

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.933
Einstein would publish not one,

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.251
not two,

00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:41.420
not three,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.577
but four extraordinary papers,
each on a different topic,

00:00:45.577 --> 00:00:51.159
that were destined to radically transform
our understanding of the universe.

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.740
The myth that Einstein
had failed math is just that.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.097
He had mastered calculus on his own
by the age of 15

00:00:58.097 --> 00:01:00.672
and done well at both
his Munich secondary school

00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:02.881
and at the Swiss Polytechnic,

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.309
where he studied for
a math and physics teaching diploma.

00:01:06.309 --> 00:01:09.247
But skipping classes to spend
more time in the lab

00:01:09.247 --> 00:01:12.232
and neglecting to show proper deference
to his professors

00:01:12.232 --> 00:01:15.643
had derailed his intended career path.

00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:18.034
Passed over even
for a lab assistant position,

00:01:18.034 --> 00:01:21.520
he had to settle for a job
at the Swiss patent office,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.539
obtained with the help
of a friend's father.

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.592
Working six days a week as a patent clerk,

00:01:26.592 --> 00:01:29.832
Einstein still managed to make
some time for physics,

00:01:29.832 --> 00:01:33.074
discussing the latest work
with a few close friends,

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:35.638
and publishing a couple of minor papers.

00:01:35.638 --> 00:01:37.149
It came as a major surprise

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.737
when in March 1905 he submitted
a paper with a shocking hypothesis.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:45.469
Despite decades of evidence
that light was a wave,

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.132
Einstein proposed that it could,
in fact, be a particle,

00:01:49.132 --> 00:01:53.049
showing that mysterious phenomena,
such as the photoelectric effect,

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.097
could be explained by his hypothesis.

00:01:56.097 --> 00:01:58.341
The idea was derided for years to come,

00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:01.997
but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time.

00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:07.811
Wave-particle duality was slated to become
a cornerstone of the quantum revolution.

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:11.050
Two months later in May,
Einstein submitted a second paper,

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.528
this time tackling the centuries old
question of whether atoms actually exist.

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:19.866
Though certain theories were built on
the idea of invisible atoms,

00:02:19.866 --> 00:02:24.393
some prominent scientists still
believed them to be a useful fiction,

00:02:24.393 --> 00:02:26.901
rather than actual physical objects.

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.028
But Einstein used an ingenious argument,

00:02:29.028 --> 00:02:31.270
showing that the behavior
of small particles

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.372
randomly moving around in a liquid,
known as Brownian motion,

00:02:35.372 --> 00:02:37.085
could be precisely predicted

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:40.424
by the collisions of millions
of invisible atoms.

00:02:40.424 --> 00:02:43.331
Experiments soon confirmed
Einstein's model,

00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:47.009
and atomic skeptics threw in the towel.

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.942
The third paper came in June.

00:02:49.942 --> 00:02:51.012
For a long time,

00:02:51.012 --> 00:02:53.461
Einstein had been troubled
by an inconsistency

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:56.299
between two fundamental
principles of physics.

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.637
The well established
principle of relativity,

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:00.655
going all the way back to Galileo,

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:04.178
stated that absolute motion
could not be defined.

00:03:04.178 --> 00:03:07.357
Yet electromagnetic theory,
also well established,

00:03:07.357 --> 00:03:10.181
asserted that absolute motion did exist.

00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.322
The discrepancy,
and his inability to resolve it,

00:03:13.322 --> 00:03:17.635
left Einstein in what he described
as a state of psychic tension.

00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:18.715
But one day in May,

00:03:18.715 --> 00:03:21.838
after he had mulled over the puzzle
with his friend Michele Besso,

00:03:21.838 --> 00:03:24.016
the clouds parted.

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.871
Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved

00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:29.861
if it was the speed of light
that remained constant,

00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:32.110
regardless of reference frame,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.381
while both time and space
were relative to the observer.

00:03:36.381 --> 00:03:39.434
It took Einstein only a few weeks
to work out the details

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:43.614
and formulate what came to be known
as special relativity.

00:03:43.614 --> 00:03:46.821
The theory not only shattered
our previous understanding of reality

00:03:46.821 --> 00:03:49.189
but would also pave the way
for technologies,

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.186
ranging from particle accelerators,

00:03:51.186 --> 00:03:53.752
to the global positioning system.

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:55.587
One might think that this was enough,

00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:56.593
but in September,

00:03:56.593 --> 00:04:02.071
a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper.

00:04:02.071 --> 00:04:04.931
Einstein had thought a little bit more
about his theory,

00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:08.694
and realized it also implied
that mass and energy,

00:04:08.694 --> 00:04:12.479
one apparently solid
and the other supposedly ethereal,

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.059
were actually equivalent.

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.928
And their relationship could be expressed
in what was to become the most famous

00:04:18.928 --> 00:04:21.831
and consequential equation in history:

00:04:21.831 --> 00:04:25.304
E=mc^2.

00:04:25.304 --> 00:04:29.947
Einstein would not become a world famous
icon for nearly another fifteen years.

00:04:29.947 --> 00:04:34.795
It was only after his later general theory
of relativity was confirmed in 1919

00:04:34.795 --> 00:04:38.515
by measuring the bending of starlight
during a solar eclipse

00:04:38.515 --> 00:04:41.441
that the press would turn him
into a celebrity.

00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:44.590
But even if he had disappeared back
into the patent office

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.745
and accomplished nothing else after 1905,

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:50.046
those four papers of his miracle year

00:04:50.046 --> 00:04:55.697
would have remained the gold standard
of startling unexpected genius.
