00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.863
Have you ever talked with a friend
about a problem only to realize

00:00:09.863 --> 00:00:14.540
that he just doesn't seem to grasp
why the issue is so important to you?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.783
Have you ever presented an idea to
a group and it's met with utter confusion?

00:00:18.783 --> 00:00:20.482
Or maybe you've been in an argument

00:00:20.482 --> 00:00:22.640
when the other person suddenly accuses you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.507
of not listening 
to what they're saying at all?

00:00:26.507 --> 00:00:27.950
What's going on here?

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.017
The answer is miscommunication,

00:00:30.017 --> 00:00:31.490
and in some form or another,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.230
we've all experienced it.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.578
It can lead to confusion,

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:35.682
animosity,

00:00:35.682 --> 00:00:36.874
misunderstanding,

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:41.573
or even crashing a multimillion
dollar probe into the surface of Mars.

00:00:41.573 --> 00:00:44.823
The fact is even when face-to-face
with another person,

00:00:44.823 --> 00:00:46.308
in the very same room,

00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.074
and speaking the same language,

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:51.489
human communication is incredibly complex.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.637
But the good news is 
that a basic understanding

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.406
of what happens when we communicate

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:59.275
can help us prevent miscommunication.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:04.228
For decades, researchers have asked,
"What happens when we communicate?"

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:06.935
One interpretation,
called the transmission model,

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:11.766
views communication as a message that
moves directly from one person to another,

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.622
similar to someone tossing a ball
and walking away.

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:16.753
But in reality,

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:20.680
this simplistic model doesn't account
for communication's complexity.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.671
Enter the transactional model,

00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:26.675
which acknowledges the many 
added challenges of communicating.

00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:30.465
With this model, it's more accurate
to think of communication between people

00:01:30.465 --> 00:01:32.272
as a game of catch.

00:01:32.272 --> 00:01:36.000
As we communicate our message,
we receive feedback from the other party.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.674
Through the transaction,
we create meaning together.

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:43.307
But from this exchange,
further complications arise.

00:01:43.307 --> 00:01:45.273
It's not like the Star Trek universe,

00:01:45.273 --> 00:01:47.393
where some characters 
can Vulcan mind meld,

00:01:47.393 --> 00:01:49.523
fully sharing thoughts and feelings.

00:01:49.523 --> 00:01:52.807
As humans, we can't help but send
and receive messages

00:01:52.807 --> 00:01:55.695
through our own subjective lenses.

00:01:55.695 --> 00:01:59.688
When communicating, one person expresses
her interpretation of a message,

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.719
and the person she's communicating with

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.521
hears his own interpretation 
of that message.

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:09.928
Our perceptual filters continually shift
meanings and interpretations.

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:11.570
Remember that game of catch?

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.722
Imagine it with a lump of clay.

00:02:13.722 --> 00:02:15.529
As each person touches it,

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.356
they shape it to fit 
their own unique perceptions

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.710
based on any number of variables,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.056
like knowledge or past experience, 
age, race, gender,

00:02:25.056 --> 00:02:28.785
ethnicity, religion, or family background.

00:02:28.785 --> 00:02:32.448
Simultaneously, every person interprets
the message they receive

00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:35.396
based on their relationship 
with the other person,

00:02:35.396 --> 00:02:36.838
and their unique understanding

00:02:36.838 --> 00:02:41.759
of the semantics and connotations 
of the exact words being used.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.562
They could also be distracted
by other stimuli,

00:02:44.562 --> 00:02:45.719
such as traffic

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.470
or a growling stomach.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.649
Even emotion might cloud 
their understanding,

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.508
and by adding more people
into a conversation,

00:02:52.508 --> 00:02:54.508
each with their own subjectivities,

00:02:54.508 --> 00:02:58.601
the complexity of communication
grows exponentially.

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:02.937
So as the lump of clay goes back and forth
from one person to another,

00:03:02.937 --> 00:03:06.033
reworked, reshaped, and always changing,

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:11.284
it's no wonder our messages sometimes
turn into a mush of miscommunication.

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:13.535
But, luckily, there are some 
simple practices

00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:18.456
that can help us all navigate our daily
interactions for better communication.

00:03:18.456 --> 00:03:19.586
One:

00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:24.041
recognize that passive hearing
and active listening are not the same.

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:28.374
Engage actively with the verbal
and nonverbal feedback of others,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:32.389
and adjust your message to faciliate
greater understanding.

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:33.286
Two:

00:03:33.286 --> 00:03:37.317
listen with your eyes and ears,
as well as with your gut.

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.276
Remember that communication 
is more than just words.

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:41.434
Three:

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:45.036
take time to understand as you try
to be understood.

00:03:45.036 --> 00:03:47.131
In the rush to express ourselves,

00:03:47.131 --> 00:03:50.227
it's easy to forget that communication
is a two-way street.

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:52.960
Be open to what 
the other person might say.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.613
And finally, four:

00:03:54.613 --> 00:03:57.849
Be aware of your personal 
perceptual filters.

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.402
Elements of your experience,

00:03:59.402 --> 00:04:01.967
including your culture, 
community, and family,

00:04:01.967 --> 00:04:04.451
influence how you see the world.

00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.968
Say, "This is how I see the problem,
but how do you see it?"

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:11.385
Don't assume that your perception
is the objective truth.

00:04:11.385 --> 00:04:14.177
That'll help you work toward sharing
a dialogue with others

00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:16.966
to reach a common understanding together.
