00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:13.196
It's 4 a.m., 
and the big test is in eight hours,

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:16.117
followed by a piano recital.

00:00:16.117 --> 00:00:21.888
You've been studying and playing for days,
but you still don't feel ready for either.

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.321
So, what can you do?

00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:25.320
Well, you can drink another cup of coffee

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.078
and spend the next few hours 
cramming and practicing,

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.004
but believe it or not,

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.482
you might be better off closing the books,
putting away the music,

00:00:33.482 --> 00:00:35.817
and going to sleep.

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:38.176
Sleep occupies nearly 
a third of our lives,

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:43.151
but many of us give surprisingly
little attention and care to it.

00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:46.730
This neglect is often the result 
of a major misunderstanding.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.639
Sleep isn't lost time,

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:52.329
or just a way to rest 
when all our important work is done.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.337
Instead, it's a critical function,

00:00:54.337 --> 00:00:58.757
during which your body balances
and regulates its vital systems,

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:00.350
affecting respiration

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.435
and regulating everything from circulation
to growth and immune response.

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:10.818
That's great, but you can worry about 
all those things after this test, right?

00:01:10.818 --> 00:01:12.436
Well, not so fast.

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:15.473
It turns out that sleep 
is also crucial for your brain,

00:01:15.473 --> 00:01:18.173
with a fifth of your body's 
circulatory blood

00:01:18.173 --> 00:01:20.853
being channeled to it as you drift off.

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:23.460
And what goes on 
in your brain while you sleep

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.541
is an intensely active period 
of restructuring

00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:29.359
that's crucial for how our memory works.

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.356
At first glance,

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:34.255
our ability to remember things 
doesn't seem very impressive at all.

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:37.038
19th century psychologist 
Herman Ebbinghaus

00:01:37.038 --> 00:01:40.913
demonstrated that we normally forget
40% of new material

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.394
within the first twenty minutes,

00:01:43.394 --> 00:01:47.134
a phenomenon known
as the forgetting curve.

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.735
But this loss can be prevented 
through memory consolidation,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:53.289
the process by which
information is moved

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:58.903
from our fleeting short-term memory
to our more durable long-term memory.

00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:02.623
This consolidation occurs with the help
of a major part of the brain,

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:05.340
known as the hippocampus.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.360
Its role in long-term memory formation

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.368
was demonstrated in the 1950s
by Brenda Milner

00:02:11.368 --> 00:02:14.656
in her research with 
a patient known as H.M.

00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:16.955
After having his hippocampus removed,

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:21.323
H.M.'s ability to form new short-term memories
was damaged,

00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:25.888
but he was able to learn physical tasks
through repetition.

00:02:25.888 --> 00:02:27.719
Due to the removal of his hippocampus,

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.294
H.M.'s ability to form long-term memories
was also damaged.

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:34.437
What this case revealed,
among other things,

00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:37.359
was that the hippocampus 
was specifically involved

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:42.062
in the consolidation of
long-term declarative memory,

00:02:42.062 --> 00:02:45.316
such as the facts and concepts
you need to remember for that test,

00:02:45.316 --> 00:02:47.125
rather than procedural memory,

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:51.728
such as the finger movements
you need to master for that recital.

00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:55.394
Milner's findings, along with work 
by Eric Kandel in the 90's,

00:02:55.394 --> 00:03:00.746
have given us our current model 
of how this consolidation process works.

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:02.798
Sensory data is initially transcribed

00:03:02.798 --> 00:03:07.071
and temporarily recorded in the neurons
as short-term memory.

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:09.624
From there, it travels to the hippocampus,

00:03:09.624 --> 00:03:13.150
which strengthens and enhances 
the neurons in that cortical area.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.369
Thanks to the phenomenon
of neuroplasticity,

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:20.341
new synaptic buds are formed,
allowing new connections between neurons,

00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:22.184
and strengthening the neural network

00:03:22.184 --> 00:03:25.934
where the information will be returned
as long-term memory.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:28.801
So why do we remember
some things and not others?

00:03:28.801 --> 00:03:30.689
Well, there are a few ways to influence

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.300
the extent and effectiveness 
of memory retention.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.435
For example, memories that are formed
in times of heightened feeling,

00:03:38.435 --> 00:03:39.470
or even stress,

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.727
will be better recorded due to 
the hippocampus' link with emotion.

00:03:44.727 --> 00:03:48.723
But one of the major factors contributing
to memory consolidation is,

00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:49.891
you guessed it,

00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:51.878
a good night's sleep.

00:03:51.878 --> 00:03:54.214
Sleep is composed of four stages,

00:03:54.214 --> 00:03:56.952
the deepest of which are known
as slow-wave sleep

00:03:56.952 --> 00:03:59.228
and rapid eye movement.

00:03:59.228 --> 00:04:02.387
EEG machines monitoring
people during these stages

00:04:02.387 --> 00:04:04.377
have shown electrical impulses

00:04:04.377 --> 00:04:09.686
moving between the brainstem,
hippocampus, thalamus, and cortex,

00:04:09.686 --> 00:04:13.528
which serve as relay stations 
of memory formation.

00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:16.901
And the different stages of sleep
have been shown to help consolidate

00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:19.108
different types of memories.

00:04:19.108 --> 00:04:22.557
During the non-REM slow-wave sleep,

00:04:22.557 --> 00:04:26.125
declarative memory is encoded 
into a temporary store

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:28.952
in the anterior part of the hippocampus.

00:04:28.952 --> 00:04:32.794
Through a continuing dialogue 
between the cortex and hippocampus,

00:04:32.794 --> 00:04:35.497
it is then repeatedly reactivated,

00:04:35.497 --> 00:04:40.998
driving its gradual redistribution
to long-term storage in the cortex.

00:04:40.998 --> 00:04:44.884
REM sleep, on the other hand, with
its similarity to waking brain activity,

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:48.474
is associated with the consolidation
of procedural memory.

00:04:48.474 --> 00:04:50.305
So based on the studies,

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.533
going to sleep three hours after 
memorizing your formulas

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:58.515
and one hour after practicing your scales
would be the most ideal.

00:04:58.515 --> 00:05:01.017
So hopefully you can see now
that skimping on sleep

00:05:01.017 --> 00:05:03.292
not only harms your long-term health,

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:05.071
but actually makes it less likely

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:09.420
that you'll retain all that knowledge
and practice from the previous night,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.543
all of which just goes to affirm
the wisdom of the phrase, "Sleep on it."

00:05:13.543 --> 00:05:15.637
When you think about 
all the internal restructuring

00:05:15.637 --> 00:05:19.366
and forming of new connections
that occurs while you slumber,

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:21.284
you could even say that proper sleep

00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:25.093
will have you waking up every morning
with a new and improved brain,

00:05:25.093 --> 00:05:27.587
ready to face the challenges ahead.
