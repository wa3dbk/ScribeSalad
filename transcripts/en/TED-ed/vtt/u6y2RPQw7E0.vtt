00:00:14.157 --> 00:00:15.056
In Physics,

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.130
the concepts of work and power help us understand

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.103
and explain lots of things in our universe.

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:23.153
Let's start with work.

00:00:23.153 --> 00:00:26.214
Positive work is the energy we put into a system,

00:00:26.214 --> 00:00:29.690
and negative work is energy that is transferred out.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.942
Think of positive work as money being added to your bank account,

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:36.756
and negative work as money taken out.

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:37.640
In the metric system,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.997
work and energy are measured in Joules.

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:46.329
As an example, let's take a beautiful, old, mechanical grandfather clock.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.327
We transfer energy into the clock

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:49.272
when we turn the crank

00:00:49.272 --> 00:00:52.229
to raise the heavy metal cylinders inside the clock.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:54.996
When we do this, we are doing positive work,

00:00:54.996 --> 00:00:57.042
adding energy to the clock,

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:00.779
and that energy is stored as gravitational potential energy.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.891
We can calculate the amount of work done by multiplying the force we apply

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.185
times the distance over which we apply the force.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.673
To raise the metal cylinders,

00:01:09.688 --> 00:01:12.673
we need to apply a force equal to their weight.

00:01:12.673 --> 00:01:14.867
That is, equal to the force of gravity

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:17.665
pulling downward on the cylinders.

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:19.717
These cylinders weight 300 Newtons,

00:01:19.717 --> 00:01:20.687
which is pretty heavy,

00:01:20.687 --> 00:01:23.097
about as much as a small child,

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:25.260
and if we lift them 1/2 meter,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.128
then we do 300 Newtons

00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:28.614
times 1/2 meter

00:01:28.614 --> 00:01:31.857
or 150 Joules of work.

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.090
Power is the rate at which energy is transferred.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.390
When we say rate,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.326
we mean the amount of energy transferred

00:01:38.326 --> 00:01:40.080
per unit of time.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.232
In the metric system, power is measured in

00:01:42.232 --> 00:01:44.015
Joules per second,

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:45.734
or Watts.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:48.143
The term Watt goes back to James Watt,

00:01:48.143 --> 00:01:50.611
who came up with the concept of horsepower

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:51.757
to measure the amount of power

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:54.619
produced by a typical work horse.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.838
James Watt was a producer of industrial steam engines,

00:01:57.838 --> 00:01:59.555
and he wanted his potential customers

00:01:59.555 --> 00:02:01.287
to be able to make comparisons

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:04.298
between his steam engines and a familiar quanity,

00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:07.265
the power they could get from a working horse.

00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:08.882
It was such a useful idea

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:11.475
that the metric system unit for power, the Watt,

00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:13.696
is named after James Watt.

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.772
Following in James Watt's footsteps,

00:02:15.772 --> 00:02:17.578
let's compare the amount of power it takes

00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:19.424
to run this grandfather clock

00:02:19.424 --> 00:02:21.393
to the power we'd need to run

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:24.404
a bright, 100-Watt light bulb.

00:02:24.404 --> 00:02:26.058
We can measure the power a person uses

00:02:26.058 --> 00:02:27.379
to wind the clock

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.385
by dividing the amount of work they did

00:02:29.385 --> 00:02:31.341
by the time it took them to do it.

00:02:31.341 --> 00:02:33.703
If it takes 1 minute, or 60 seconds,

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:35.093
to lift the weights,

00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:37.531
then they are doing 150 Joules

00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:39.234
divided by 60 seconds,

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:43.124
or 2.5 Joules per second of work.

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:45.198
They are adding energy to the clock

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:48.459
in the rate of 2.5 Watts.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.176
You would need about 40 times as much

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:53.272
to run a bright, 100-Watt light bulb.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:54.918
Before we let the clock run,

00:02:54.918 --> 00:02:56.279
the energy is stored

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.296
as gravitational potential energy of the cylinders.

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:00.340
It's like your bank account

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.749
when you have just deposited money.

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.460
But if we let the clock run,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.752
the cylinders slowly move downward.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.542
Energy is leaving the clock.

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:10.771
In fact, when the cylinders get to the bottom,

00:03:10.771 --> 00:03:13.630
all the energy that we put in will have left.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.272
So how much power does the clock use?

00:03:16.272 --> 00:03:20.746
That is, how many Joules of energy per second leave the clock

00:03:20.761 --> 00:03:25.724
if it takes 5 days for the cylinders to return to their original position?

00:03:25.748 --> 00:03:26.840
We can figure this out

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.039
because we already know how much work we did

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.600
when we lifted the cylinders:

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.469
150 Joules.

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.754
But this time, it took 5 days rather than a minute.

00:03:35.754 --> 00:03:38.830
Five days is 5 times 24

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.051
times 60

00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.548
times 60 again

00:03:41.548 --> 00:03:44.640
or 432,000 seconds.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.048
So we divide the work done by the time

00:03:47.048 --> 00:03:53.231
and find the answer of about 0.00035 Joules per second,

00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:56.791
or about 0.35 milliwatts.

00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:58.719
That's a tiny amount of power.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.607
This clock uses so little power

00:04:00.607 --> 00:04:03.906
that you could run almost 300,000 clocks

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:07.812
using the same power it takes to run one 100-Watt light bulb.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:10.073
That's right, you could run a clock in every house

00:04:10.073 --> 00:04:13.448
in a medium sized city with that much power.

00:04:13.448 --> 00:04:15.232
That's a pretty amazing conclusion

00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:16.363
and it took knowledge of work

00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:18.783
and power to figure it out.
