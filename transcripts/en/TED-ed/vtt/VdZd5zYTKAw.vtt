00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:08.984
It was the dawn of 1863,

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.935
and London’s 
not-yet-opened subway system,

00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:16.184
the first of its kind in the world, 
had the city in an uproar.

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:20.094
Digging a hole under the city 
and putting a railroad in it

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:22.557
seemed the stuff of dreams.

00:00:22.557 --> 00:00:24.755
Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:29.625
and a local minister accused the railway
company of trying to break into hell.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:31.923
Most people simply thought the project,

00:00:31.923 --> 00:00:35.425
which cost more than
100 million dollars in today’s money,

00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:36.994
would never work.

00:00:36.994 --> 00:00:38.732
But it did.

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:41.107
On January 10, 1863,

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:46.254
30,000 people ventured underground 
to travel on the world’s first subway

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:49.654
on a four-mile stretch of line in London.

00:00:49.654 --> 00:00:52.676
After three years of construction
and a few setbacks,

00:00:52.676 --> 00:00:56.197
the Metropolitan Railway 
was ready for business.

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.605
The city’s officials were much relieved.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:00.545
They’d been desperate to find a way

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:03.853
to reduce the terrible 
congestion on the roads.

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:08.345
London, at the time the world’s largest 
and most prosperous city,

00:01:08.345 --> 00:01:10.826
was in a permanent state of gridlock,

00:01:10.826 --> 00:01:11.685
with carts,

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:12.703
costermongers,

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:13.471
cows,

00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:16.143
and commuters jamming the roads.

00:01:16.143 --> 00:01:20.163
It’d been a Victorian visionary, 
Charles Pearson,

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.335
who first thought of putting railways 
under the ground.

00:01:23.335 --> 00:01:26.932
He’d lobbied for underground trains 
throughout the 1840s,

00:01:26.932 --> 00:01:29.907
but opponents thought the idea
was impractical

00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:34.444
since the railroads at the time 
only had short tunnels under hills.

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.754
How could you get a railway 
through the center of a city?

00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:42.033
The answer was a simple system 
called "cut and cover."

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:44.625
Workers had to dig a huge trench,

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.354
construct a tunnel out of brick archways,

00:01:47.354 --> 00:01:51.065
and then refill the hole 
over the newly built tunnel.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:52.584
Because this was disruptive

00:01:52.584 --> 00:01:55.505
and required the demolition 
of buildings above the tunnels,

00:01:55.505 --> 00:01:58.473
most of the line went
under existing roads.

00:01:58.473 --> 00:02:00.866
Of course, there were accidents.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:04.840
On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm 
flooded the nearby sewers

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.363
and burst through the excavation,

00:02:07.363 --> 00:02:09.973
delaying the project by several months.

00:02:09.973 --> 00:02:13.036
But as soon as 
the Metropolitan Railway opened,

00:02:13.036 --> 00:02:16.207
Londoners rushed in 
to ride the new trains.

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:20.211
The Metropolitan quickly became 
a vital part of London’s transport system.

00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.424
Additional lines were soon built,

00:02:22.424 --> 00:02:25.626
and new suburbs grew around the stations.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.312
Big department stores opened 
next to the railroad,

00:02:28.312 --> 00:02:31.184
and the railway company 
even created attractions,

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:37.275
like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls
Court to bring in tourists by train.

00:02:37.275 --> 00:02:38.624
Within 30 years,

00:02:38.624 --> 00:02:41.415
London’s subway system covered 
80 kilometers,

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:44.463
with lines in the center of town
running in tunnels,

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:48.984
and suburban trains operating 
on the surface, often on embankments.

00:02:48.984 --> 00:02:50.840
But London was still growing,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.814
and everyone wanted 
to be connected to the system.

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:55.255
By the late 1880s,

00:02:55.255 --> 00:02:59.736
the city had become too dense with
buildings, sewers, and electric cables

00:02:59.736 --> 00:03:01.905
for the "cut and cover" technique,

00:03:01.905 --> 00:03:04.375
so a new system had to be devised.

00:03:04.375 --> 00:03:07.324
Using a machine 
called the Greathead Shield,

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:11.164
a team of just 12 workers could 
bore through the earth,

00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:15.075
carving deep underground tunnels 
through the London clay.

00:03:15.075 --> 00:03:19.156
These new lines, called tubes,
were at varying depths,

00:03:19.156 --> 00:03:23.326
but usually about 25 meters deeper than 
the "cut and cover" lines.

00:03:23.326 --> 00:03:26.436
This meant their construction 
didn’t disturb the surface,

00:03:26.436 --> 00:03:29.335
and it was possible 
to dig under buildings.

00:03:29.335 --> 00:03:32.494
The first tube line, 
the City and South London,

00:03:32.494 --> 00:03:36.054
opened in 1890 and proved so successful

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:40.033
that half a dozen more lines 
were built in the next 20 years.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:44.755
This clever new technology was even used 
to burrow several lines

00:03:44.755 --> 00:03:47.393
under London’s river, the Thames.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.824
By the early 20th century,

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:50.536
Budapest,

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:51.257
Berlin,

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:51.995
Paris,

00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:52.865
and New York

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.535
had all built subways of their own.

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:59.955
And today, with more than 160 cities 
in 55 countries

00:03:59.955 --> 00:04:02.995
using underground rails 
to combat congestion,

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:06.805
we can thank Charles Pearson
and the Metropolitan Railway

00:04:06.805 --> 00:04:09.094
for getting us started on the right track.
