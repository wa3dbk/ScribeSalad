00:00:11.293 --> 00:00:13.561
Light, bright, and cheerful.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:17.881
It's some of the most familiar
of all early 18th century music.

00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:21.371
It's been featured in uncounted films
and television commercials,

00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:24.630
but what is it 
and why does it sound that way?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.462
This is the opening of "Spring"
from "The Four Seasons,"

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:30.803
by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi.

00:00:30.803 --> 00:00:35.031
"The Four Seasons" are famous in part
because they are a delight to the ear.

00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:36.542
However, even more notable

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.572
is the fact that 
they have stories to tell.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:43.352
At the time of their publication
in Amsterdam in 1725,

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:44.883
they were accompanied by poems

00:00:44.883 --> 00:00:47.522
describing exactly what feature
of that season

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:50.982
Vivaldi intended to capture 
in musical terms.

00:00:50.982 --> 00:00:53.963
In providing specific plot content
for instrumental music,

00:00:53.963 --> 00:00:57.877
Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time.

00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:01.483
If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music,

00:01:01.483 --> 00:01:03.773
one would find the poetic scenes

00:01:03.773 --> 00:01:07.362
synchronizing nicely 
with the musical imagery.

00:01:07.362 --> 00:01:11.142
We are told that the birds welcome
spring with happy song,

00:01:11.142 --> 00:01:15.962
and here they are doing exactly that.

00:01:15.962 --> 00:01:21.032
Soon, however, 
a thunderstorm breaks out.

00:01:21.032 --> 00:01:23.393
Not only is there musical thunder
and lightning,

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:25.083
there are also more birds,

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:30.584
wet, frightened, and unhappy.

00:01:30.584 --> 00:01:39.413
In "Summer," the turtle dove sings 
her name "tortorella" in Italian,

00:01:39.413 --> 00:01:45.885
before a hail storm flattens the fields.

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:53.777
"Autumn" brings eager hunters dashing
out in pursuit of their prey.

00:01:53.777 --> 00:02:00.504
The "Winter" concerto begins with teeth
chattering in the cold

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:07.283
before one takes refuge by
a crackling fire.

00:02:07.283 --> 00:02:09.264
Then it's back out into the storm

00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:15.165
where there'll be slips 
and falls on the ice.

00:02:15.165 --> 00:02:18.315
In these first weeks of winter,
the old year is coming to a close,

00:02:18.315 --> 00:02:23.175
and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration
of the seasons.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:24.905
Not until the early 19th century

00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:28.305
would such expressive instrumental
program music, as it was known,

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:30.386
become popular.

00:02:30.386 --> 00:02:33.305
By then, larger, more varied ensembles
were the rule

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:36.925
with woodwinds, brass, and percussion
to help tell the tale.

00:02:36.925 --> 00:02:42.358
But Vivaldi pulled it off with just
one violin, strings, and a harpsichord.

00:02:42.358 --> 00:02:44.186
Unlike his contemporary Bach,

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:48.005
Vivaldi wasn't much interested
in complicated fugues.

00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:52.036
He preferred to offer readily
accessible entertainment to his listeners

00:02:52.036 --> 00:02:54.512
with melodies that pop back up later
in a piece

00:02:54.512 --> 00:02:58.037
to remind us of where we've been.

00:02:58.037 --> 00:03:02.026
So the first movement of the "Spring"
concerto begins with a theme for spring

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:12.836
and ends with it, too, slightly varied
from when it was last heard.

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:15.466
It was an inspired way 
to attract listeners,

00:03:15.466 --> 00:03:16.689
and Vivaldi,

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.976
considered one of the most electrifying 
violinists of the early 18th century,

00:03:20.976 --> 00:03:23.930
understood the value 
of attracting audiences.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.639
Such concerts might feature himself
as the star violinist.

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:30.150
Others presented the young musicians
of the Pietà,

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.680
a Venetian girls' school
where Vivaldi was Director of Music.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.387
Most of the students were orphans.

00:03:36.387 --> 00:03:40.677
Music training was intended not only
as social skills suitable for young ladies

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:42.658
but also as potential careers

00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:46.498
for those who might fail
to make good marriages.

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.459
Even in the composer's own time,

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.919
Vivaldi's music served 
as diversion for all,

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.708
not just for the wealthy aristocrats.

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:56.768
300 years later, it's an approach
that still works,

00:03:56.768 --> 00:04:00.328
and Vivaldi's music still sounds
like trotting horses on the move.
