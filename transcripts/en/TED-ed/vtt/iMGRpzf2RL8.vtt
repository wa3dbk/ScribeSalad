00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000
(Music)

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I want everyone to put their hands on top of their head.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put your hands on top of your head.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Just relax. Just stay calm. Everything will be nice

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and smooth if you just participate and just relax, okay?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Yeah. All right, now put your hands down.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't be no hero. Put your hands down. Okay?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
All right. Now. Cool. Good.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I want you to run all that financial aid.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Yeah, sucka, put the scholarships in the bag, yeah, yeah.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Put the scholarships in the bag. Yeah, you too, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Yeah, you. Yeah, yeah. You over there, go put the Pell Grants in the bag.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Put the Pell Grants in there too. Yeah, you. Go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You, go over to that booth and get me some of them subsidized, some of them subsidized loans.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It ain't a game no more. I know you're hiding the money somewhere here.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
With all this tuition you got me and my homies payin' --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Woo! -- I'm about to get gangster-scholar up in here.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Up in here. I'm about to go N.W.A. meets Beastie Boys

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
if I don't see the cash, man.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Cause we're not gonna take it. ♪ Oh ...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh, you thought I was playing.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Oh, you thought this was a game. Back up, back up. Mind your business, that's all.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
What do you, think this is a game? What?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Huh? You don't even know me.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I'll say something else. Don't call me crazy.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Do not call me -- Rives, tell 'em don't call me crazy before I go crazy.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I'm telling you, now I'm about to go crazy. I'm about to go Tupac Thug Life in here.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Like, "I ain't a killer but don't push me. Revenge is like the sweetest joy --" Woo!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm about to go Biggie Smalls Brooklyn type, like,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
"Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis. When I was dead broke --"

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Woo! I'm about to go KRS-One

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs-type wild.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Like, "Wa da da dang, wa da da da dang,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
listen to my nine millimeter go bang." You know what?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You are dumb. You are really dumb.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Hide your kids, hide your wife, 'cause we gettin' financial aid

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
all up and in and around here. You think this is a game?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
You think I want to be out here doing this?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Do you know how hard it was to find these guns?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
All right, I'm sorry. You understand?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I'm just trying to get my education. You know what I mean?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm just trying to fight for the opportunity that my great-great-great-grandfather died for, you know what I'm saying?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
You know how my ancestors did sit-ins,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
just so I can sit in a classroom.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And all these years, all y'all been doing

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is strangling the life out of my bank statement,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
leaving my pockets as vacant as parking lots.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Professor Willie Lynch taught you well, huh?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Keep the body, take the money.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Force feed my people deception and failure.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Condition our brains to malfunction at the sight

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of success. Just keep the cycle going.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Make us pay for an education that will end up failing us.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Put us in debt so we're giving back

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the money we earned from our back-breaking work.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This seems all too familiar.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Sounds like the rust of shackles locking their way onto my degree.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Sounds like the Thirteenth Amendment in reverse.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Lecture halls shouldn't feel like cotton fields,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
shouldn't sound like muffled freedom songs trapped

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
in the jaws of a generation's dreams. Oho! Oh, it all makes sense.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Give us enough to get by but not enough to provide for ourselves.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Keep us psychologically feeble so we lose our purpose in the process.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Stop thieving our aspirations out of our sleep.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Don't call it financial aid

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
if you're not helping anyone with it.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We have fought.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We have fought way too hard

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to let green paper build a barricade in front of our futures.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I will not let you potentially rob food out of my children's stomach.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Best believe I'm going out blasting.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
I ain't no killer, but don't push me.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I wish it didn't come to this, but I have to for my cousins

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in Haiti who don't even know what a college looks like,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for my best friend Raymond sitting in cell block nine

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
instead of a university,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
for the nooses hanging my GPA by its neck.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
There is no other option.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There is no other way.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Just, please, put the money in the bag.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Put the money in the bag. I just want to go to school, man.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I just want to get my education. I just want to learn. I just want to grow.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Put the money in the bag, please.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Just put the money in the bag.
