00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.543
What is bipolar disorder?

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:12.605
The word bipolar means two extremes.

00:00:12.605 --> 00:00:16.785
For the many millions experiencing
bipolar disorder around the world,

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.405
life is split between 
two different realities -

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:22.836
elation and depression.

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:25.874
Although there are many variations
of bipolar disorder,

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:27.816
let's consider a couple.

00:00:27.816 --> 00:00:31.915
Type 1 has extreme highs
alongside the lows,

00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:36.506
while Type 2 involves briefer, 
less extreme periods of elation

00:00:36.506 --> 00:00:39.736
interspersed with long periods
of depression.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:42.545
For someone seesawing between
emotional states,

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:48.076
it can feel impossible to find the balance
necessary to lead a healthy life.

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:52.256
Type 1's extreme highs are known
as manic episodes,

00:00:52.256 --> 00:00:56.775
and they can make a person range from
feeling irritable to invincible.

00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:01.225
But these euphoric episodes exceed
ordinary feelings of joy,

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:03.847
causing troubling symptoms 
like racing thoughts,

00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:05.336
sleeplessness,

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:06.516
rapid speech,

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:07.962
impuslive actions,

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:10.125
and risky behaviors.

00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:12.904
Without treatment, these episodes
become more frequent,

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:13.827
intense,

00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:16.216
and take longer to subside.

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:20.626
The depressed phase of bipolar disorder
manifests in many ways -

00:01:20.626 --> 00:01:21.657
a low mood,

00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:23.719
dwindling interest in hobbies,

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.257
changes in appetite,

00:01:25.257 --> 00:01:27.857
feeling worthless or excessively guilty,

00:01:27.857 --> 00:01:30.147
sleeping either too much or too little,

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:32.256
restlessness or slowness,

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:35.562
or persistent thoughts of suicide.

00:01:35.562 --> 00:01:38.397
Worldwide, about one 
to three percent of adults

00:01:38.397 --> 00:01:43.597
experience the broad range of symptoms
that indicate bipolar disorder.

00:01:43.597 --> 00:01:46.967
Most of those people are functional,
contributing members of society,

00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:49.527
and their lives, choices, 
and relationships

00:01:49.527 --> 00:01:52.097
aren't defined by the disorder,

00:01:52.097 --> 00:01:55.697
but still, for many, the consequences
are serious.

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:59.426
The illness can undermine educational
and professional performance,

00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:00.578
relationships,

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:01.909
financial security,

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.297
and personal safety.

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:08.407
So what causes bipolar disorder?

00:02:08.407 --> 00:02:12.558
Researchers think a key player is 
the brain's intricate wiring.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:15.949
Healthy brains maintain strong connections
between neurons

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:19.488
thanks to the brain's continuous efforts
to prune itself

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:24.682
and remove unused or faulty
neural connections.

00:02:24.682 --> 00:02:28.977
This process is important because our 
neural pathways serve as a map

00:02:28.977 --> 00:02:31.389
for everything we do.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.858
Using functional magnetic 
resonance imaging,

00:02:33.858 --> 00:02:38.099
scientists have discovered that the brain's 
pruning ability is disrupted

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.771
in people with bipolar disorder.

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:43.058
That means their neurons go haywire

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:46.398
and create a network
that's impossible to navigate.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:49.228
With only confusing signals as a guide,

00:02:49.228 --> 00:02:53.938
people with bipolar disorder develop
abnormal thoughts and behaviors.

00:02:53.938 --> 00:02:55.558
Also, psychotic symptoms,

00:02:55.558 --> 00:02:57.920
like disorganized speech and behavior,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.227
delusional thoughts,

00:02:59.227 --> 00:03:00.488
paranoia,

00:03:00.488 --> 00:03:01.786
and hallucinations

00:03:01.786 --> 00:03:05.959
can emerge during extreme phases
of bipolar disorder.

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.379
This is attributed to the overabundance
of a neurotransmitter called dopamine.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:17.450
But despite these insights, we can't pin
bipolar disorder down to a single cause.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.069
In reality, it's a complex problem.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.369
For example, the brain's amygdala
is involved in thinking,

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.780
long-term memory,

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.831
and emotional processing.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.419
In this brain region, factors as varied
as genetics and social trauma

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.609
may create abnormalities and trigger
the symptoms of bipolar disorder.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.640
The condition tends to run in families,

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.200
so we do know that genetics have
a lot to do with it.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.469
But that doesn't mean there's
a single bipolar gene.

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.520
In fact, the likelihood of developing
bipolar disorder

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.009
is driven by the interactions between
many genes

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.591
in a complicated recipe we're still
trying to understand.

00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:57.120
The causes are complex,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.360
and consequently, diagnosing and living
with bipolar disorder is a challenge.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.280
Despite this, the disorder 
is controllable.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.801
Certain medications like lithium can help
manage risky thoughts and behaviors

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:11.971
by stabilizing moods.

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:17.861
These mood stabilizing medications work by
decreasing abnormal activity in the brain,

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:21.070
thereby strengthening the viable
neural connections.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.451
Other frequently used medications
include antipsychotics,

00:04:24.451 --> 00:04:27.281
which alter the effects of dopamine,

00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.472
and electroconvulsive therapy,

00:04:29.472 --> 00:04:32.772
which works like a carefully controlled
seizure in the brain,

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.752
is sometimes used as 
an emergency treatment.

00:04:35.752 --> 00:04:38.031
Some bipolar patients reject treatment

00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:40.321
because they're afraid it will
dim their emotions

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.451
and destroy their creativity.

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:46.062
But modern psychiatry is actively
trying to avoid that.

00:04:46.062 --> 00:04:49.753
Today, doctors work with patients
on a case-by-case basis

00:04:49.753 --> 00:04:53.351
to administer a combination of treatments
and therapies

00:04:53.351 --> 00:04:56.973
that allows them to live 
to their fullest possible potential.

00:04:56.973 --> 00:05:00.182
And beyond treatment, people with
bipolar disorder can benefit

00:05:00.182 --> 00:05:02.312
from even simpler changes.

00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:04.091
Those include regular exercise,

00:05:04.091 --> 00:05:05.462
good sleep habits,

00:05:05.462 --> 00:05:08.023
and sobriety from drugs and alcohol,

00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:12.412
not to mention the acceptance
and empathy of family and friends.

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:15.522
Remember, bipolar disorder 
is a medical condition,

00:05:15.522 --> 00:05:17.340
not a person's fault,

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.992
or their whole identity,

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:20.969
and it's something that can be controlled

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.489
through a combination of medical 
treatments doing their work internally,

00:05:24.489 --> 00:05:29.019
friends and family fostering acceptance
and understanding on the outside,

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.464
and people with bipolar disorder 
empowering themselves

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.584
to find balance in their lives.
