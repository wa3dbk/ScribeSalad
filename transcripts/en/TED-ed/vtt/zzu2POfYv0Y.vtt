00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.030
How does the difference between

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.860
point 0000000398 and

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.660
point 00000000398

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.880
cause one to have red eyes after swimming?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.980
To answer this, we first need a way of

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.000
dealing with rather small numbers,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or in some cases extremely large numbers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.310
This leads us
to the concept of logarithms.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.980
Well, what are logarithms?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.033
Let's take the base number, b,

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.536
and raise it to a power, p,

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:43.000
like 2 to the 3rd power,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.570
and have it equal a number n.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.270
We get an exponential equation:
b raised to the p power, equals n.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.366
In our example, that'd be 2 raised

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:53.192
to the 3rd power, equals 8.

00:00:53.192 --> 00:00:55.041
The exponent p is said to be

00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.200
the logarithm of the number n.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.140
Most of the time this would be written:

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.540
"log, base b, of a number
equals p, the power."

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.593
This is starting to sound a bit confusing
with all the variables,

00:01:06.593 --> 00:01:08.220
so let's show this with an example.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.333
What is the value of

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:11.676
log base 10 of 10,000?

00:01:11.676 --> 00:01:14.000
The same question could be asked
using exponents:

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.380
"10 raised to what power is 10,000?"

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.666
Well, 10 to the 4th is 10,000.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:20.332
So, log base 10 of 10,000

00:01:20.332 --> 00:01:22.290
must equal 4.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
This example can also be completed 
very simply on a scientific calculator.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.446
Log base 10 is used so frequently

00:01:28.446 --> 00:01:29.712
in the sciences

00:01:29.712 --> 00:01:34.790
that it has the honor of having
its own button on most calculators.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.000
If the calculator will figure out
logs for me,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.470
why study them?

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.756
Just a quick reminder:

00:01:39.756 --> 00:01:43.532
the log button only computes
logarithms of base 10.

00:01:43.532 --> 00:01:45.604
What if you want to go into
computer science

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:47.746
and need to understand base 2?

00:01:47.746 --> 00:01:50.190
So what is log base 2 of 64?

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.990
In other words,
2 raised to what power is 64?

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.110
Well, use your fingers.
2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.510
So log base 2 of 64 must equal 6.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.370
So what does this have to do
with my eyes turning red

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.696
in some swimming pools

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:08.812
and not others?

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:10.601
Well, it leads us into an interesting

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:12.530
use of logarithms in chemistry:

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.600
finding the pH of water samples.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.600
pH tells us how acidic
or basic a sample is,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.600
and can be calculated with the formula: 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.630
pH equals negative log base 10 of 
the hydrogen ion concentration, or H plus.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.980
We can find the pH of water samples

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.210
with hydrogen ion concentration of 
point 0000000398

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.620
and point 00000000398

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.870
quickly on a calculator.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.986
Punch: negative log
of each of those numbers,

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:46.282
and you'll see the pH's are 7.4 and 8.4.

00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.150
Since the tears in our eyes
have a pH of about 7.4,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.420
the H plus concentration of .0000000398

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.960
will feel nice on your eyes,

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.260
but the pH of 8.4
will make you feel itchy and red.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.030
It's easy to remember logarithms
"log base b of some number n equals p"

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.733
by repeating: "The base raised
to what power equals the number?"

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:12.506
"The BASE raised to what POWER
equals the NUMBER?"

00:03:12.506 --> 00:03:14.890
So now we know
logarithms are very powerful

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.056
when dealing with
extremely small or large numbers.

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:19.692
Logarithms can even be used

00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:21.928
instead of eyedrops after swimming.
