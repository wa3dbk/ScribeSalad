00:00:13.952 --> 00:00:15.811
When you think about the brain,

00:00:15.835 --> 00:00:17.629
it's difficult to understand,

00:00:17.653 --> 00:00:20.891
because if I were to ask you right now,
how does the heart work,

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:23.057
you would instantly tell me it's a pump.

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:24.499
It pumps blood.

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.199
If I were to ask about your lungs,

00:00:26.223 --> 00:00:28.799
you would say it exchanges
oxygen for carbon dioxide.

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:29.837
That's easy.

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.926
If I were to ask you how the brain works,
it's hard to understand

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.003
because you can't just look
at a brain and understand what it is.

00:00:36.027 --> 00:00:38.831
It's not a mechanical object,
not a pump, not an airbag.

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:41.718
It's just like, if you held it
in your hand when it was dead,

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:42.947
it's just a piece of fat.

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:47.274
To understand how the brain works,
you have to go inside a living brain.

00:00:47.298 --> 00:00:50.976
Because the brain's not mechanical,
the brain is electrical and it's chemical.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.813
Your brain is made out of
100 billion cells, called neurons.

00:00:53.837 --> 00:00:57.714
And these neurons communicate
with each other with electricity.

00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:00.976
And we're going to eavesdrop
in on a conversation between two cells,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.858
and we're going to listen
to something called a spike.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:07.775
But we're not going to record my brain
or your brain or your teachers' brains,

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.094
we're going to use our good
friend the cockroach.

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:11.976
Not just because I think they're cool,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.378
but because they have brains
very similar to ours.

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:17.070
So if you learn a little bit
about how their brains work,

00:01:17.094 --> 00:01:19.572
we're going to learn a lot
about how our brains work.

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:21.675
I'm going to put them
in some ice water here

00:01:22.612 --> 00:01:23.685
And then --

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:26.619
Audience: Ew!
Greg Gabe: Yeah ...

00:01:26.643 --> 00:01:28.619
Right now they're becoming anesthetized.

00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:31.945
Because they're cold blooded,
they become the temperature of the water

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.095
and they can't control it
so they just basically "chillax," right?

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.976
They're not going to feel anything,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.775
which may tell you a little
about what we're going to do,

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.429
a scientific experiment
to understand the brain.

00:01:42.453 --> 00:01:43.474
So ...

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:45.976
This is the leg of a cockroach.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.143
And a cockroach
has all these beautiful hairs

00:01:48.167 --> 00:01:49.976
and pricklies all over it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.976
Underneath each one of those is a cell,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.976
and this cell's a neuron
that is going to send information

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.439
about wind or vibration.

00:01:57.463 --> 00:02:01.309
If you ever try to catch a cockroach,
it's hard because they can feel you coming

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.492
before you're even there,
they start running.

00:02:03.516 --> 00:02:06.285
These cells are zipping up
this information up to the brain

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:09.092
using those little axons
with electronic messages in there.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:11.698
We're going to record
by sticking a pin right in there.

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:14.369
We need to take off the leg
of a cockroach --

00:02:14.393 --> 00:02:15.976
don't worry, they'll grow back --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.317
then we're going to put two pins in there.

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.365
These are metal pins.

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:23.020
One will pick up this electronic message,
this electric message is going by.

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:26.524
So, we're now going to do the surgery,
let's see if you guys can see this.

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.038
Yeah, it's gross ...

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.880
All right. So there we go.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.673
You guys can see his leg right there.

00:02:37.697 --> 00:02:39.197
Now I'm going to take this leg,

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:41.937
I'm going to put it in this invention
that we came up with

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.079
called the Spikerbox --

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:46.609
and this replaces lots of expensive
equipment in a research lab,

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:49.809
so you guys can do this
in your own high schools,

00:02:49.833 --> 00:02:52.087
or in your own basements if it's me.

00:02:53.418 --> 00:02:54.751
(Audience: Laughter)

00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:57.275
So, there.

00:02:59.973 --> 00:03:01.334
Can you guys see that?

00:03:01.358 --> 00:03:04.110
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead
and turn this on.

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:07.976
I'm going to plug it in.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.001
(Tuning sound)

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:11.588
To me, this is the most beautiful
sound in the world.

00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:13.620
This is what your brain
is doing right now.

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:16.576
You have 100 billion cells
making these raindrop-type noises.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.585
Let's take a look at what it looks like,

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.408
let's pull it up on the iPad screen.

00:03:20.432 --> 00:03:22.161
I plugged my iPad into here as well.

00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:24.429
So remember we said
the axon looks like a spike.

00:03:24.453 --> 00:03:25.870
So we're going to take a look

00:03:25.894 --> 00:03:28.536
at what one of them
looks like in just a brief second.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.786
We're going to tap here,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.515
so we can sort of average this guy.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:33.976
So there we see it.
That's an action potential.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.048
You've got 100 billion cells
in your brain doing this right now,

00:03:37.072 --> 00:03:40.316
sending all this information back
about what you're seeing, hearing.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.641
We also said this is a cell

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:44.976
that's going to be taking up information
about vibrations in the wind.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.715
So what if we do an experiment?

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.446
We can actually blow on this
and hear if we see a change.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.952
Are you guys going to be ready?

00:03:50.976 --> 00:03:53.271
If I blow on it you tell me
if you hear anything.

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:54.363
(Blowing)

00:03:55.007 --> 00:03:56.483
(Sound changes)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.413
Let me just touch this
with a little pen here.

00:03:59.437 --> 00:04:00.586
(Noise)

00:04:02.761 --> 00:04:04.333
That was the neural firing rate.

00:04:04.357 --> 00:04:07.334
That actually took a while
in neuroscience to understand this.

00:04:07.358 --> 00:04:08.651
This is called rate coding:

00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:11.642
the harder you press on something,
the more spikes there are,

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.097
and all that information
is coming up to your brain.

00:04:14.121 --> 00:04:15.603
That's how you perceive things.

00:04:15.627 --> 00:04:18.349
So that's one way of doing
an experiment with electricity.

00:04:18.373 --> 00:04:22.894
The other way is that your brain is not
only taking in electrical impulses,

00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:24.071
you're also sending out.

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.044
That's how you move your muscles around.

00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:29.228
Let's see what happens if I've plugged in
something that's electric

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:30.976
into the cockroach leg here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.744
I'm going to take two pins,
I'm going to plug them onto the cockroach.

00:04:34.768 --> 00:04:38.260
I'm going to take the other end,
I'm going to plug in into my iPod.

00:04:38.284 --> 00:04:39.737
It's my iPhone actually.

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.872
Do you guys know how your earbuds
work in your ears?

00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:45.203
You have a battery
in your phone, or iPod, right?

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:48.330
It's sending electrical current
into these magnets in your earbuds

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.976
which shake back and forth
and allow you to hear things.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.976
But that current's the same currency
that our brain uses,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.956
so we can send that to our cockroach leg

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.315
and hopefully if this works,

00:04:57.339 --> 00:05:00.681
we can actually see what happens
when we play music into the cockroach.

00:05:00.705 --> 00:05:01.827
Let's take a look.

00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:05.929
(Music beat)

00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:07.444
Can we turn it up? There we go.

00:05:07.468 --> 00:05:09.976
(Audience reacts and gasps)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.730
GG: So what's happening?

00:05:11.754 --> 00:05:13.000
Audience: Wow!

00:05:13.024 --> 00:05:14.110
(Laughter)

00:05:14.134 --> 00:05:16.976
So you see what's moving.
It's moving on the bass.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.168
All those audiophiles out there,

00:05:19.192 --> 00:05:21.319
if you have awesome, kicking car stereos,

00:05:21.343 --> 00:05:23.937
you know, the bass speakers
are the biggest speakers.

00:05:23.961 --> 00:05:26.047
The biggest speakers
have the longest waves,

00:05:26.071 --> 00:05:27.412
which have the most current,

00:05:27.436 --> 00:05:30.023
and the current is what's causing
these things to move.

00:05:30.047 --> 00:05:33.676
So it's not just speakers
that are causing electricity.

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.590
Microphones also cause electricity.

00:05:35.614 --> 00:05:36.686
(Beat)

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.383
So I'm going to go ahead and invite
another person out on the stage here

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.615
to help me out with this.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.763
So there we go.

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:44.906
(Beatboxing)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.429
This is the first time this has ever
happened in the history of mankind.

00:05:50.453 --> 00:05:52.976
Human beatbox to a cockroach leg.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.474
When you guys go back to your high school,
think about neuroscience

00:05:56.498 --> 00:05:58.976
and how you guys can begin
the neuro-revolution.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.701
Thank you very much. Bye bye.

00:06:00.725 --> 00:06:01.725
(Applause)
