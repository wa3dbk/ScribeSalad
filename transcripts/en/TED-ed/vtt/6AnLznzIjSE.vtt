00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Scientists who are called astrobiologists

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
are trying to find that out right now.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if there's microbial life on Mars,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that intelligent creatures elsewhere

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But how likely is it

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that they will manage to find a signal?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but something called the Drake equation,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
named after Frank Drake,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
can help us organize our thinking

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
about what might be required

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
for successful detection.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
If you've dealt with equations before,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then you probably expect

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that there will be a solution to the equation,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
a right answer.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The Drake equation, however, is different,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because there are so many unknowns.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It has no right answer.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
As we learn more about our universe

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and our place within it,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
some of the unknowns get better known,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we can estimate an answer a bit better.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But there won't be a definite answer to the Drake equation

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
until SETI succeeds

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
or something else proves that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Earthlings are the only intelligent species in our portion of the cosmos.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
In the meantime,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it is really useful to consider the unknowns.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The Drake equation attempts to estimate

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the number of technological civilizations

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in the Milky Way Galaxy -- we call that N --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
with whom we could make contact,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and it's usually written as:

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
N equals R-star

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
multiplied by f-sub-p

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
multiplied by n-sub-e

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
multiplied by f-sub-l

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
multiplied by f-sub-i

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
multiplied by f-sub-c

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and lastly, multiplied by capital L.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
All those factors multiplied together

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
help to estimate the number

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of technological civilizations

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that we might be able to detect right now.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
R-star is the rate at which

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
stars have been born in the Milky Way Galaxy

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
over the last few billion years,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
so it's a number that is stars per year.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Our galaxy is 10 billion years old,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and early in its history stars formed at a different rate.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
All of the f-factors are fractions.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Each one must be less than or equal to one.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
F-sub-p is the fraction of stars that have planets.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
N-sub-e

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is the average number of habitable planets

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in any planetary system.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
F-sub-l

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is the fraction of planets on which life actually begins

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and f-sub-i is the fraction of all those life forms

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that develop intelligence.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
F-sub-c is the fraction of intelligent life

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that develops a civilization

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that decides to use some sort of transmitting technology.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And finally, L --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the longevity factor.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
On average, how many years

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
do those transmitters continue to operate?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Astronomers are now almost able

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to tell us what the product of the first three terms is.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We're now finding exoplanets almost everywhere.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
The fractions dealing with life and intelligence

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and technological civilizations

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
are ones that many, many experts ponder,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but nobody knows for sure.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So far,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
we only know of one place in the universe

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
where life exists,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and that's right here on Earth.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
In the next couple of decades,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
as we explore Mars and Europa and Titan,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the discovery of any kind of life there

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
will mean that life will be abundant

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
in the Milky Way.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Because if life originated twice

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
within this one Solar System,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
it means it was easy,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and given similar conditions elsewhere,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
life will happen.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So the number two is a very important number here.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Scientists, including SETI researchers,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
often tend to make very crude estimates

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and acknowledge that there are very large

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
uncertainties in these estimates, in order to make progress.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We think we know

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that R-star and n-sub-e are both numbers that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
are closer to 10 than, say, to one,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and all the f-factors are less than one.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Some of them may be much less than one.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But of all these unknowns,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the biggest unknown is L,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
so perhaps the most useful version of the Drake equation

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
is simply to say that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
N is approximately equal to L.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The information in this equation is very clear.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Unless L is large,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
N will be small.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But, you know, you can also turn that around.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal in the near future,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
after examining only a small portion

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
of the stars in the Milky Way,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
then we learn that

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
L, on average, must be large.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Otherwise, we couldn't have succeeded so easily.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
A physicist named Philip Morrison

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
summarizes by saying

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that SETI is the archaeology of the future.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
By this, he meant that

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
because the speed of light is finite,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
any signals detected from distant technologies

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
will be telling us about their past

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
by the time they reach us.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But because L must be large

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
for a successful detection,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
we also learn about our future,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
particularly that we can have a long future.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We've developed technologies that can send signals into space

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and humans to the moon,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
but we've also developed technologies that can destroy the environment,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that can wage war

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
with weapons and biological terrorism.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
In the future,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
will our technology help stabilize our planet

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and our population,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
leading to a very long lifetime for us?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I encourage you to consider

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the unknowns in this equation.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Why don't you make your own estimates

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
for these unknowns, and see what you come up with for N?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Compare that with the estimates made by Frank Drake,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Carl Sagan, other scientists

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
or your neighbors.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Remember, there's no right answer.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Not yet.
