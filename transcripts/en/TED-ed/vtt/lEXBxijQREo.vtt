00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.077
Picture warm, gooey cookies,

00:00:09.101 --> 00:00:12.052
crunchy candies, velvety cakes,

00:00:12.076 --> 00:00:14.670
waffle cones piled high with ice cream.

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:16.646
Is your mouth watering?

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.867
Are you craving dessert?

00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:18.922
Why?

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:23.676
What happens in the brain
that makes sugary foods so hard to resist?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.089
Sugar is a general term
used to describe a class of molecules

00:00:27.113 --> 00:00:28.403
called carbohydrates,

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.254
and it's found in a wide variety
of food and drink.

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:34.418
Just check the labels
on sweet products you buy.

00:00:34.442 --> 00:00:36.910
Glucose, fructose, sucrose,

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.783
maltose, lactose, dextrose, and starch

00:00:39.807 --> 00:00:41.762
are all forms of sugar.

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:43.717
So are high-fructose corn syrup,

00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.270
fruit juice, raw sugar, and honey.

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:49.638
And sugar isn't just
in candies and desserts,

00:00:49.662 --> 00:00:51.186
it's also added to tomato sauce,

00:00:51.188 --> 00:00:55.676
yogurt, dried fruit,
flavored waters, or granola bars.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.663
Since sugar is everywhere,
it's important to understand

00:00:58.687 --> 00:00:59.882
how it affects the brain.

00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:02.251
What happens when sugar hits your tongue?

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:05.206
And does eating a little bit of sugar
make you crave more?

00:01:05.753 --> 00:01:07.323
You take a bite of cereal.

00:01:07.347 --> 00:01:10.504
The sugars it contains activate
the sweet-taste receptors,

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:12.746
part of the taste buds on the tongue.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.747
These receptors send a signal
up to the brain stem,

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.237
and from there, it forks off
into many areas of the forebrain,

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.789
one of which is the cerebral cortex.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:25.983
Different sections of the cerebral cortex
process different tastes:

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:27.971
bitter, salty, umami,

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:29.799
and, in our case, sweet.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:33.416
From here, the signal activates
the brain's reward system.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.101
This reward system is a series
of electrical and chemical pathways

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:39.725
across several different
regions of the brain.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:41.035
It's a complicated network,

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:44.484
but it helps answer a single,
subconscious question:

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:45.853
should I do that again?

00:01:45.877 --> 00:01:49.477
That warm, fuzzy feeling you get
when you taste Grandma's chocolate cake?

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.380
That's your reward system saying,

00:01:51.404 --> 00:01:52.916
"Mmm, yes!"

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.273
And it's not just activated by food.

00:01:55.297 --> 00:01:57.583
Socializing, sexual behavior, and drugs

00:01:57.607 --> 00:02:00.710
are just a few examples
of things and experiences

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:03.277
that also activate the reward system.

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:08.645
But overactivating this reward system
kickstarts a series of unfortunate events:

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.300
loss of control, craving,
and increased tolerance to sugar.

00:02:13.158 --> 00:02:15.231
Let's get back to our bite of cereal.

00:02:15.255 --> 00:02:18.888
It travels down into your stomach
and eventually into your gut.

00:02:18.912 --> 00:02:19.925
And guess what?

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.356
There are sugar receptors here, too.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.731
They are not taste buds,
but they do send signals

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:26.563
telling your brain that you're full

00:02:26.587 --> 00:02:28.730
or that your body should
produce more insulin

00:02:28.754 --> 00:02:30.979
to deal with the extra sugar
you're eating.

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:34.539
The major currency
of our reward system is dopamine,

00:02:34.563 --> 00:02:37.129
an important chemical or neurotransmitter.

00:02:37.153 --> 00:02:39.660
There are many dopamine
receptors in the forebrain,

00:02:39.684 --> 00:02:41.816
but they're not evenly distributed.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.624
Certain areas contain dense
clusters of receptors,

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:48.311
and these dopamine hot spots
are a part of our reward system.

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:51.549
Drugs like alcohol, nicotine, or heroin

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:53.342
send dopamine into overdrive,

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:56.425
leading some people
to constantly seek that high,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.170
in other words, to be addicted.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:03.532
Sugar also causes dopamine to be released,
though not as violently as drugs.

00:03:03.556 --> 00:03:06.665
And sugar is rare
among dopamine-inducing foods.

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.628
Broccoli, for example, has no effect,

00:03:08.652 --> 00:03:10.088
which probably explains

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:12.813
why it's so hard to get
kids to eat their veggies.

00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:14.851
Speaking of healthy foods,

00:03:14.875 --> 00:03:17.690
let's say you're hungry
and decide to eat a balanced meal.

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:21.325
You do, and dopamine levels spike
in the reward system hot spots.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.706
But if you eat that same dish
many days in a row,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.974
dopamine levels will spike less and less,
eventually leveling out.

00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:30.760
That's because when it comes to food,

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:34.931
the brain evolved to pay special attention
to new or different tastes.

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:36.061
Why?

00:03:36.085 --> 00:03:37.245
Two reasons:

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.785
first, to detect food that's gone bad.

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.729
And second, because the more variety
we have in our diet,

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:45.852
the more likely we are
to get all the nutrients we need.

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.227
To keep that variety up,

00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.639
we need to be able
to recognize a new food,

00:03:49.663 --> 00:03:53.520
and more importantly, we need
to want to keep eating new foods.

00:03:53.544 --> 00:03:57.343
And that's why the dopamine levels off
when a food becomes boring.

00:03:57.367 --> 00:03:58.942
Now, back to that meal.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:02.068
What happens if in place
of the healthy, balanced dish,

00:04:02.092 --> 00:04:04.283
you eat sugar-rich food instead?

00:04:04.307 --> 00:04:07.315
If you rarely eat sugar
or don't eat much at a time,

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.949
the effect is similar
to that of the balanced meal.

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:13.702
But if you eat too much,
the dopamine response does not level out.

00:04:13.726 --> 00:04:17.721
In other words, eating lots of sugar
will continue to feel rewarding.

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:21.129
In this way, sugar behaves
a little bit like a drug.

00:04:21.153 --> 00:04:24.597
It's one reason people seem
to be hooked on sugary foods.

00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:27.513
So, think back to all those
different kinds of sugar.

00:04:27.537 --> 00:04:30.904
Each one is unique,
but every time any sugar is consumed,

00:04:30.928 --> 00:04:35.265
it kickstarts a domino effect in the brain
that sparks a rewarding feeling.

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.696
Too much, too often,
and things can go into overdrive.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.951
So, yes, overconsumption of sugar
can have addictive effects on the brain,

00:04:42.975 --> 00:04:46.178
but a wedge of cake once
in a while won't hurt you.
