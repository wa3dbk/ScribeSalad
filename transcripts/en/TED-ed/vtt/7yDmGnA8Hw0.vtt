00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:12.031
Taking that internship 
in a remote mountain lab

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:14.539
might not have been the best idea.

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.291
Pulling that lever with the skull symbol
just to see what it did

00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:20.743
probably wasn't so smart, either,

00:00:20.743 --> 00:00:23.278
but now is not the time for regrets

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:28.223
because you need to get away
from these mutant zombies fast.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:32.236
With you are the janitor, 
the lab assistant, and the old professor.

00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:36.255
You've gotten a headstart,
but there's only one way to safety:

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:40.684
across an old rope bridge
spanning a massive gorge.

00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:42.805
You can dash across in a minute,

00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:46.265
while the lab assistant takes two minutes.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:49.452
The janitor is a bit slower
and needs five minutes,

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:52.725
and the professor takes
a whole ten minutes,

00:00:52.725 --> 00:00:56.031
holding onto the ropes 
every step of the way.

00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:58.677
By the professor's calculations,

00:00:58.677 --> 00:01:02.611
the zombies will catch up to you
in just over 17 minutes,

00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:08.778
so you only have that much time
to get everyone across and cut the ropes.

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:13.305
Unfortunately, the bridge can only hold
two people at a time.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.729
To make matters worse,

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.972
it's so dark out that you can barely see,

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:21.698
and the old lantern you grabbed on
your way only illuminates a tiny area.

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:26.994
Can you figure out a way
to have everyone escape in time?

00:01:26.994 --> 00:01:30.883
Remember: no more than two people
can cross the bridge together,

00:01:30.883 --> 00:01:35.247
anyone crossing must either
hold the lantern or stay right next to it,

00:01:35.247 --> 00:01:40.321
and any of you can safely wait in the dark
on either side of the gorge.

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:45.603
Most importantly, everyone must be
safely across before the zombies arrive.

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:50.573
Otherwise, the first zombie could step on
the bridge while people are still on it.

00:01:50.573 --> 00:01:53.007
Finally, there are no tricks to use here.

00:01:53.007 --> 00:01:54.645
You can't swing across,

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:56.388
use the bridge as a raft,

00:01:56.388 --> 00:01:58.760
or befriend the zombies.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.735
Pause the video now 
if you want to figure it out for yourself!

00:02:01.735 --> 00:02:03.023
Answer in: 3

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:04.379
Answer in: 2

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:05.632
Answer in: 1

00:02:05.632 --> 00:02:08.163
At first it might seem 
like no matter what you do,

00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:12.691
you're just a minute or two short of time,
but there is a way.

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:16.997
The key is to minimize the time wasted
by the two slowest people

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:19.088
by having them cross together.

00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:22.621
And because you'll need to make
a couple of return trips with the lantern,

00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.639
you'll want to have the fastest people
available to do so.

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.461
So, you and the lab assistant quickly
run across with the lantern,

00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:34.646
though you have to slow down 
a bit to match her pace.

00:02:34.646 --> 00:02:37.559
After two minutes, both of you are across,

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.287
and you, as the quickest, 
run back with the lantern.

00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:43.213
Only three minutes have passed.

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:44.788
So far, so good.

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:46.614
Now comes the hard part.

00:02:46.614 --> 00:02:50.320
The professor and the janitor take
the lantern and cross together.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.949
This takes them ten minutes

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.460
since the janitor has to slow down 
for the old professor

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460
who keeps muttering

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.501
that he probably shouldn't 
have given the zombies night vision.

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.248
By the time they're across,
there are only four minutes left,

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:05.925
and you're still stuck
on the wrong side of the bridge.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:10.965
But remember, the lab assistant
has been waiting on the other side,

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.790
and she's the second fastest of the group.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.111
So she grabs the lantern 
from the professor

00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.804
and runs back across to you.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:23.010
Now with only two minutes left,
the two of you make the final crossing.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.122
As you step on the far side of the gorge,

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:28.823
you cut the ropes 
and collapse the bridge behind you,

00:03:28.823 --> 00:03:30.589
just in the nick of time.

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.415
Maybe next summer, 
you'll just stick to the library.
