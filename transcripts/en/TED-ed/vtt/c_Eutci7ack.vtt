00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:12.625
Every day of your life,

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:15.337
you move through systems of power
that other people made.

00:00:15.337 --> 00:00:16.661
Do you sense them?

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.794
Do you understand power?

00:00:18.794 --> 00:00:21.047
Do you realize why it matters?

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:24.395
Power is something we are often
uncomfortable talking about.

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:28.691
That's especially true in civic life,
how we live together in community.

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:34.466
In a democracy, power is supposed to
reside with the people, period.

00:00:34.466 --> 00:00:37.418
Any further talk about power
and who really has it

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:40.837
seems a little dirty,
maybe even evil.

00:00:40.837 --> 00:00:44.925
But power is no more inherently good or
evil than fire or physics.

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:47.374
It just is.

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:49.988
It governs how any form of 
government works.

00:00:49.988 --> 00:00:53.408
It determines who gets to determine
the rules of the game.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.778
So learning how power operates is key
to being effective,

00:00:56.778 --> 00:01:01.472
being taken seriously,
and not being taken advantage of.

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:04.010
In this lesson, we'll look at where
power comes from,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.784
how it's exercised and what you can do to
become more powerful in public life.

00:01:09.784 --> 00:01:11.982
Let's start with a basic definition.

00:01:11.982 --> 00:01:15.741
Power is the ability to make others do
what you would have them do.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.315
Of course, this plays out in 
all arenas of life,

00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:24.053
from family to the workplace 
to our relationships.

00:01:24.053 --> 00:01:26.664
Our focus is on the civic arena,

00:01:26.664 --> 00:01:29.415
where power means getting a community
to make the choices

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.524
and to take the actions that you want.

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:35.183
There are six main sources of civic power.

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:38.992
First, there's physical force
and a capacity for violence.

00:01:38.992 --> 00:01:42.236
Control of the means of force,
whether in the police or a militia,

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:44.904
is power at its most primal.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.908
A second core source 
of power is wealth.

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:53.900
Money creates the ability to buy results
and to buy almost any other kind of power.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.933
The third form of power is state action,
government.

00:01:57.933 --> 00:02:00.783
This is the use of law and 
bureaucracy to compel people

00:02:00.783 --> 00:02:04.023
to do or not do certain things.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.628
In a democracy, for example,
we the people, theoretically,

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:10.699
give government its power
through elections.

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:14.792
In a dictatorship, state power emerges
from the threat of force,

00:02:14.792 --> 00:02:17.316
not the consent of the governed.

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:21.942
The fourth type of power is social norms
or what other people think is okay.

00:02:21.942 --> 00:02:24.672
Norms don't have the centralized
machinery of government.

00:02:24.672 --> 00:02:27.871
They operate in a softer way,
peer to peer.

00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:31.831
They can certainly make people
change behavior and even change laws.

00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:36.131
Think about how norms around marriage
equality today are evolving.

00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:39.418
The fifth form of power is ideas.

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:42.827
An idea, individual liberties, say,
or racial equality,

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:45.339
can generate boundless amounts
of power

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:49.620
if it motivates enough people to change
their thinking and actions.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.124
And so the sixth source of 
power is numbers, lots of humans.

00:02:54.124 --> 00:02:56.653
A vocal mass of people creates
power by expressing

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:58.999
collective intensity of interest

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.054
and by asserting legitimacy.

00:03:01.054 --> 00:03:04.232
Think of the Arab Spring
or the rise of the Tea Party.

00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:06.192
Crowds count.

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:10.297
These are the six main sources of power,
what power is.

00:03:10.297 --> 00:03:13.665
So now, let's think about how
power operates.

00:03:13.665 --> 00:03:17.678
There are three laws of power 
worth examining.

00:03:17.678 --> 00:03:21.067
Law number one:
power is never static.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.566
It's always either accumulating
or decaying in a civic arena.

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:30.339
So if you aren't taking action,
you're being acted upon.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:34.093
Law number two:
power is like water.

00:03:34.093 --> 00:03:36.758
It flows like a current 
through everyday life.

00:03:36.758 --> 00:03:41.304
Politics is the work of harnessing 
that flow in a direction you prefer.

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:46.242
Policymaking is an effort to freeze
and perpetuate a particular flow of power.

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:49.035
Policy is power frozen.

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:51.743
Law number three:
power compounds.

00:03:51.743 --> 00:03:55.525
Power begets more power,
and so does powerlessness.

00:03:55.525 --> 00:03:59.350
The only thing that keeps law
number three from leading to a situation

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.444
where only one person has all the power

00:04:02.444 --> 00:04:09.336
is how we apply laws one and two.

00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:14.180
What rules do we set up so that a few
people don't accumulate too much power,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.284
and so that they can't enshrine their
privilege in policy?

00:04:18.284 --> 00:04:20.425
That's the question of democracy,

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:25.162
and you can see each of these laws at work
in any news story.

00:04:25.162 --> 00:04:27.875
Low wage workers organize to
get higher pay.

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:30.732
Oil companies push to get a big
pipeline approved.

00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:33.985
Gay and lesbian couples seek the legal
right to marry.

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:36.949
Urban parents demand school vouchers.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.191
You may support these efforts or not.

00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:43.961
Whether you get what you want depends
on how adept you are with power,

00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:48.927
which brings us finally to what you can do
to become more powerful in public life.

00:04:48.927 --> 00:04:51.643
Here, it's useful to think in
terms of literacy.

00:04:51.643 --> 00:04:56.437
Your challenge is to learn how to read 
power and write power.

00:04:56.437 --> 00:05:01.092
To read power means to pay attention to
as many texts of power as you can.

00:05:01.092 --> 00:05:02.709
I don't mean books only.

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:06.013
I mean seeing society as a set of texts.

00:05:06.013 --> 00:05:09.190
Don't like how things are in your campus
or city or country?

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.610
Map out who has what kind of power,
arrayed in what systems.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.926
Understand why it turned out this way,

00:05:15.926 --> 00:05:19.449
who's made it so, 
and who wants to keep it so.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.882
Study the strategies others
in such situations used:

00:05:23.882 --> 00:05:28.471
frontal attack or indirection,

00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.803
coalitions or charismatic authority.

00:05:31.803 --> 00:05:34.623
Read so you may write.

00:05:34.623 --> 00:05:39.188
To write power requires first that you 
believe you have the right to write,

00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:40.988
to be an author of change.

00:05:40.988 --> 00:05:42.148
You do.

00:05:42.148 --> 00:05:45.423
As with any kind of writing,
you learn to express yourself,

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:47.255
speak up in a voice that's authentic.

00:05:47.255 --> 00:05:51.397
Organize your ideas, 
then organize other people.

00:05:51.397 --> 00:05:53.025
Practice consensus building.

00:05:53.025 --> 00:05:54.554
Practice conflict.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.462
As with writing,
it's all about practice.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:01.315
Every day you have a chance to practice,
in your neighborhood and beyond.

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:03.296
Set objectives, then bigger ones.

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:05.874
Watch the patterns, see what works.

00:06:05.874 --> 00:06:07.737
Adapt, repeat.

00:06:07.737 --> 00:06:12.261
This is citizenship.

00:06:12.261 --> 00:06:15.424
In this short lesson, we've explored where
civic power comes from,

00:06:15.424 --> 00:06:19.167
how it works
and what you can do to exercise it.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:22.604
One big question remaining
is the "why" of power.

00:06:22.604 --> 00:06:27.929
Do you want power to benefit everyone
or only you?

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:31.023
Are your purposes
pro-social or anti-social?

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:33.053
This question isn't about strategy.

00:06:33.053 --> 00:06:36.773
It's about character,
and that's another set of lessons.

00:06:36.773 --> 00:06:39.168
But remember this:

00:06:39.168 --> 00:06:42.458
Power plus character
equals a great citizen,

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:45.194
and you have the power to be one.
