00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:08.266
Have you experienced déjà vu?

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.540
It's that shadowy feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar.

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:15.527
A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember.

00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:18.335
The world moves like a ballet
you've choreographed,

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.836
but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.376
because you've never eaten here before.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.305
This is the first time you've had clams,

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.737
so what's going on?

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.462
Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:33.112
The experience is brief
and occurs without notice,

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:36.686
making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.069
Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them --

00:00:40.093 --> 00:00:41.199
this could take years.

00:00:41.223 --> 00:00:43.341
It has no physical manifestations

00:00:43.365 --> 00:00:44.553
and in studies,

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.543
it's described by the subject
as a sensation or feeling.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.389
Because of this lack of hard evidence,

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:52.382
there's been a surplus
of speculation over the years.

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:54.724
Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.059
as a French term meaning "already seen,"

00:00:57.083 --> 00:01:00.441
more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon.

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:04.738
Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive psychology

00:01:04.762 --> 00:01:06.641
narrow down the field of prospects.

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:09.704
Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent theories,

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:11.806
using the same
restaurant setting for each.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.734
First up is dual processing.

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:14.762
We'll need an action.

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:17.371
Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray of dishes.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:18.587
As the scene unfolds,

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.691
your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry of information:

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.207
the waiter's flailing arms,

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:24.249
his cry for help,

00:01:24.273 --> 00:01:25.751
the smell of pasta.

00:01:25.775 --> 00:01:28.870
Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:31.289
and is processed into a single moment.

00:01:31.313 --> 00:01:33.866
Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.250
However, this theory asserts

00:01:35.274 --> 00:01:37.996
that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.297
in information from one of these pathways.

00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.798
The difference in arrival times

00:01:41.822 --> 00:01:44.179
causes the brain to interpret
the late information

00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:45.742
as a separate event.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:48.018
When it plays
over the already-recorded moment,

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.759
it feels as if it's happened before

00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:51.980
because, in a sense, it has.

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:55.349
Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:57.403
rather than a mistake in the present.

00:01:57.427 --> 00:01:59.237
This is the hologram theory,

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.530
and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.348
As you scan its squares,

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:06.267
a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain.

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.487
According to the theory,

00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:09.202
this is because memories are stored

00:02:09.226 --> 00:02:10.604
in the form of holograms,

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:11.719
and in holograms,

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:14.200
you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture.

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:17.252
Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past,

00:02:17.276 --> 00:02:18.991
maybe from your grandmother's house.

00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:22.837
However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's,

00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:24.830
your brain has summoned up the old memory

00:02:24.854 --> 00:02:26.448
without identifying it.

00:02:26.472 --> 00:02:29.796
This leaves you stuck with familiarity,
but no recollection.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.968
Although you've never been
in this restaurant,

00:02:31.992 --> 00:02:35.306
you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.601
Now, look at this fork.

00:02:36.625 --> 00:02:38.015
Are you paying attention?

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.144
Our last theory is divided attention,

00:02:40.168 --> 00:02:41.988
and it states that déjà vu occurs

00:02:42.012 --> 00:02:44.430
when our brain subliminally
takes in an environment

00:02:44.454 --> 00:02:47.180
while we're distracted
by one particular object.

00:02:47.204 --> 00:02:48.490
When our attention returns,

00:02:48.514 --> 00:02:50.324
we feel as if we've been here before.

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:52.452
For example, just now
you focused on the fork

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:55.112
and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:57.430
Although your brain has been
recording everything

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:58.694
in your peripheral vision,

00:02:58.718 --> 00:03:00.933
it's been doing so
below conscious awareness.

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:03.300
When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork,

00:03:03.324 --> 00:03:05.707
you think you've been here before
because you have,

00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:07.355
you just weren't paying attention.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.729
While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu,

00:03:10.753 --> 00:03:13.005
none of them propose to be
the conclusive source

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.142
of the phenomenon.

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:16.546
Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.348
to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting moment,

00:03:19.372 --> 00:03:21.403
we can study the moment ourselves.

00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:25.480
After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.319
so why can't one be yours?

00:03:27.343 --> 00:03:30.703
The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it.

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:32.114
Have you been distracted?

00:03:32.138 --> 00:03:34.235
Is there a familiar object somewhere?

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:36.314
Is your brain just acting slow?

00:03:36.338 --> 00:03:38.600
Or is it something else?
