00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:09.363
If you've watched the news
or followed politics

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:11.839
chances are you've heard 
the term Orwellian

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.834
thrown around 
in one context or another.

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:17.821
But have you ever stopped to think
about what it really means,

00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.425
or why it's used so often?

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:23.475
The term was named 
after British author Eric Blair

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.883
known by his pen name George Orwell.

00:00:26.883 --> 00:00:30.360
Because his most famous work,
the novel "1984,"

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.377
depicts an oppressive society 
under a totalitarian government,

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:38.904
"Orwellian" is often used simply
to mean authoritarian.

00:00:38.904 --> 00:00:40.808
But using the term in this way

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.919
not only fails to fully 
convey Orwell's message,

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:50.155
it actually risks doing precisely what 
he tried to warn against.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:53.604
Orwell was indeed opposed 
to all forms of tyranny,

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:57.225
spending much of his life fighting against
anti-democratic forces

00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:00.530
of both the left-wing and the right.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.713
But he was also deeply concerned
with how such ideologies proliferate.

00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:07.606
And one of his most profound insights

00:01:07.606 --> 00:01:13.712
was the importance that language plays
in shaping our thoughts and opinions.

00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:19.335
The government of "1984"'s Oceania
controls its people's actions and speech

00:01:19.335 --> 00:01:22.580
in some ways that are obvious.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.403
Their every move and word 
is watched and heard,

00:01:26.403 --> 00:01:29.362
and the threat of what happens 
to those who step out of line

00:01:29.362 --> 00:01:33.213
is always looming overhead.

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:36.814
Other forms of control are not so obvious.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:40.667
The population is inundated 
with a constant barrage of propaganda

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:47.933
made up of historical facts and statistics
manufactured in the Ministry of Truth.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:51.046
The Ministry of Peace is the military.

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:53.972
Labor camps are called "Joycamps."

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:59.807
Political prisoners are detained
and tortured in the Ministry of Love.

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:03.645
This deliberate irony is an example
of doublespeak,

00:02:03.645 --> 00:02:08.012
when words are used not to convey meaning
but to undermine it,

00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:12.219
corrupting the very ideas they refer to.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.036
The regime's control of language 
goes even further,

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.130
eliminating words from 
the English language

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.502
to create the official 
dialect of Newspeak,

00:02:20.502 --> 00:02:24.843
a crudely limited collection of acronyms
and simple concrete nouns

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:30.913
lacking any words complex enough
to encourage nuanced or critical thought.

00:02:30.913 --> 00:02:35.144
This has an effect on the psyche
Orwell calls, "Doublethink,"

00:02:35.144 --> 00:02:37.452
a hypnotic state of cognitive dissonance

00:02:37.452 --> 00:02:40.833
in which one is compelled 
to disregard their own perception

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:44.580
in place of the officially 
dictated version of events,

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.739
leaving the individual 
completely dependent

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.897
on the State's definition 
of reality itself.

00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:52.079
The result is a world

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.608
in which even the privacy of one's 
own thought process is violated,

00:02:56.608 --> 00:03:02.261
where one may be found guilty
of thoughtcrime by talking in their sleep,

00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.887
and keeping a diary 
or having a love affair

00:03:04.887 --> 00:03:10.087
equals a subversive act of rebellion.

00:03:10.087 --> 00:03:15.490
This might sound like something that can
only happen in totalitarian regimes,

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.958
but Orwell was warning us about
the potential for this occurring

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:22.296
even in democratic societies.

00:03:22.296 --> 00:03:28.622
And this is why "authoritarian" alone
does not "Orwellian" make.

00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:31.281
In his essay, 
"Politics and the English Language,"

00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:35.756
he described techniques like using
pretentious words to project authority,

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:39.897
or making atrocities sound acceptable
by burying them in euphemisms

00:03:39.897 --> 00:03:42.848
and convoluted sentence structures.

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:47.666
But even more mundane abuses of language
can affect the way we think about things.

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:50.781
The words you see 
and hear in everyday advertising

00:03:50.781 --> 00:03:55.852
have been crafted to appeal to you
and affect your behavior,

00:03:55.852 --> 00:04:00.038
as have the soundbites and talking points
of political campaigns

00:04:00.038 --> 00:04:04.917
which rarely present the most
nuanced perspective on the issues.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:09.825
And the way that we use ready-made phrases
and responses gleaned from media reports

00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:11.918
or copied from the Internet

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:15.478
makes it easy to get away 
with not thinking too deeply

00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:18.434
or questioning your assumptions.

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:21.324
So the next time you hear someone
use the word Orwellian,

00:04:21.324 --> 00:04:23.152
pay close attention.

00:04:23.152 --> 00:04:26.588
If they're talking about the deceptive
and manipulative use of language,

00:04:26.588 --> 00:04:29.067
they're on the right track.

00:04:29.067 --> 00:04:32.374
If they're talking about mass surveillance
and intrusive government,

00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:38.141
they're describing something authoritarian
but not necessarily Orwellian.

00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:42.348
And if they use it as an all-purpose word
for any ideas they dislike,

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:46.047
it's possible their statements 
are more Orwellian

00:04:46.047 --> 00:04:50.319
than whatever it is they're criticizing.

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.158
Words have the power to shape thought.

00:04:52.158 --> 00:04:55.975
Language is the currency of politics,

00:04:55.975 --> 00:04:59.861
forming the basis of society from
the most common, everyday interactions

00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:02.817
to the highest ideals.

00:05:02.817 --> 00:05:05.575
Orwell urged us to protect our language

00:05:05.575 --> 00:05:09.305
because ultimately our ability to think
and communicate clearly

00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:13.381
is what stands between us and a world
where war is peace

00:05:13.381 --> 00:05:15.919
and freedom is slavery.
