00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:11.521
Imagine you're watching a runaway trolley
barreling down the tracks

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:15.961
straight towards five workers
who can't escape.

00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:18.179
You happen to be standing next to a switch

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.680
that will divert the trolley
onto a second track.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.980
Here's the problem.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.069
That track has a worker on it, too,
but just one.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.390
What do you do?

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.685
Do you sacrifice one person to save five?

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.414
This is the trolley problem,

00:00:35.414 --> 00:00:42.103
a version of an ethical dilemma that
philosopher Philippa Foot devised in 1967.

00:00:42.103 --> 00:00:45.371
It's popular because it forces us
to think about how to choose

00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:48.060
when there are no good choices.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.200
Do we pick the action 
with the best outcome

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.400
or stick to a moral code that prohibits
causing someone's death?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.837
In one survey, about 90% of respondents
said that it's okay to flip the switch,

00:01:00.837 --> 00:01:04.250
letting one worker die to save five,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.600
and other studies, including a virtual
reality simulation of the dilemma,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.040
have found similar results.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.061
These judgments are consistent with the
philosophical principle of utilitarianism

00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:18.521
which argues that 
the morally correct decision

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:23.351
is the one that maximizes well-being
for the greatest number of people.

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:25.481
The five lives outweigh one,

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:30.562
even if achieving that outcome requires
condemning someone to death.

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:33.471
But people don't always take
the utilitarian view,

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:37.062
which we can see by changing
the trolley problem a bit.

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:40.303
This time, you're standing on a bridge
over the track

00:01:40.303 --> 00:01:43.192
as the runaway trolley approaches.

00:01:43.192 --> 00:01:44.873
Now there's no second track,

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:48.794
but there is a very large man 
on the bridge next to you.

00:01:48.794 --> 00:01:52.492
If you push him over, 
his body will stop the trolley,

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:54.243
saving the five workers,

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:56.033
but he'll die.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:59.432
To utilitarians, 
the decision is exactly the same,

00:01:59.432 --> 00:02:01.982
lose one life to save five.

00:02:01.982 --> 00:02:04.584
But in this case, only about 10% of people

00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:08.453
say that it's OK to throw the man
onto the tracks.

00:02:08.453 --> 00:02:11.914
Our instincts tell us that deliberately
causing someone's death

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:16.303
is different than allowing them to die
as collateral damage.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:20.953
It just feels wrong for reasons
that are hard to explain.

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:23.473
This intersection between ethics
and psychology

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:26.604
is what's so interesting 
about the trolley problem.

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:30.984
The dilemma in its many variations reveal
that what we think is right or wrong

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:36.345
depends on factors other than 
a logical weighing of the pros and cons.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.835
For example, men are more likely
than women

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:42.504
to say it's okay to push the man
over the bridge.

00:02:42.504 --> 00:02:46.994
So are people who watch a comedy clip
before doing the thought experiment.

00:02:46.994 --> 00:02:49.165
And in one virtual reality study,

00:02:49.165 --> 00:02:52.944
people were more willing 
to sacrifice men than women.

00:02:52.944 --> 00:02:55.214
Researchers have studied 
the brain activity

00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:59.535
of people thinking through the classic
and bridge versions.

00:02:59.535 --> 00:03:04.054
Both scenarios activate areas of the brain
involved in conscious decision-making

00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:06.514
and emotional responses.

00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:10.975
But in the bridge version,
the emotional response is much stronger.

00:03:10.975 --> 00:03:13.194
So is activity in an area of the brain

00:03:13.194 --> 00:03:16.884
associated with processing 
internal conflict.

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:18.145
Why the difference?

00:03:18.145 --> 00:03:22.912
One explanation is that pushing someone
to their death feels more personal,

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:26.925
activating an emotional aversion
to killing another person,

00:03:26.925 --> 00:03:31.424
but we feel conflicted because we know
it's still the logical choice.

00:03:31.424 --> 00:03:36.405
"Trolleyology" has been criticized by some
philosophers and psychologists.

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:41.266
They argue that it doesn't reveal anything
because its premise is so unrealistic

00:03:41.266 --> 00:03:45.425
that study participants 
don't take it seriously.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:48.556
But new technology is making this kind
of ethical analysis

00:03:48.556 --> 00:03:50.698
more important than ever.

00:03:50.698 --> 00:03:54.036
For example, driver-less cars 
may have to handle choices

00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:58.007
like causing a small accident
to prevent a larger one.

00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:01.626
Meanwhile, governments are researching
autonomous military drones

00:04:01.626 --> 00:04:05.976
that could wind up making decisions of
whether they'll risk civilian casualties

00:04:05.976 --> 00:04:09.276
to attack a high-value target.

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:11.197
If we want these actions to be ethical,

00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:15.397
we have to decide in advance
how to value human life

00:04:15.397 --> 00:04:17.667
and judge the greater good.

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:20.107
So researchers who study 
autonomous systems

00:04:20.107 --> 00:04:22.207
are collaborating with philosophers

00:04:22.207 --> 00:04:27.628
to address the complex problem
of programming ethics into machines,

00:04:27.628 --> 00:04:30.957
which goes to show that 
even hypothetical dilemmas

00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:35.058
can wind up on a collision course
with the real world.
