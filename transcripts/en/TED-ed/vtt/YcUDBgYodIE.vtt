00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:19.250
Most people have heard the word "gerrymandering" once or twice,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.000
probably during a presidential election.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.215
What exactly is gerrymandering?

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:29.649
Essentially, it's the process of giving one political party an advantage over another political party

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.631
by redrawing district lines.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.982
It's like Democrats trying to gain an advantage over Republicans,

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:38.898
or Republicans trying to gain an advantage over Democrats.

00:00:38.898 --> 00:00:42.532
You see, each party wants to gain as many districts as possible

00:00:42.532 --> 00:00:45.115
so they can do things like control the state budget,

00:00:45.115 --> 00:00:48.865
or set themselves up to win even more districts in the future.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:53.249
So to understand how this process began, and how it continues today,

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:56.882
we must go back to 1812 in Massachusetts. 

00:00:56.882 --> 00:01:02.681
Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts, supported and signed a bill to allow redistricting.

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:06.417
That is, redrawing the boundaries that separate districts.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:10.465
The catch? The new lines would favor Gerry's own political party,

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:13.715
the Democratic-Republican party, which no longer exists.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:18.432
You see, Gerry wanted his party to win as many state Senate seats as possible.

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:22.448
The more members of your party who vote, the more likely you are to win an election.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:27.231
The new lines were drawn to include loads of areas that would help Governor Gerry in the future.

00:01:27.231 --> 00:01:31.697
They were so strange looking that someone said the new districts looked like a salamander.

00:01:31.697 --> 00:01:34.648
The Boston Gazette added Gerry's name to the word salamander,

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:37.132
and voilà! Gerrymandering,

00:01:37.132 --> 00:01:42.749
the process of dividing up and redrawing districts to give your political party an advantage.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.583
So how exactly does someone go about protecting their own political party,

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:49.115
and actually gerrymandering a district?

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:51.167
There are two successful practices.

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:52.350
Packing a district,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.381
and cracking a district.

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:58.965
Packing is the process of drawing district lines and packing in your opponents like cattle,

00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:01.316
into as few districts as possible.

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:04.466
If more districts equals more votes, the fewer the districts there are,

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:07.365
the fewer votes the opposition party will get.

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:11.966
Packing, then, decreases the opponent's voter strength and influence.

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:14.048
Cracking is the opposite:

00:02:14.048 --> 00:02:17.098
taking one district and cracking it into several pieces.

00:02:17.098 --> 00:02:20.917
This is usually done in districts where your opponent has many supporters.

00:02:20.917 --> 00:02:23.931
Cracking spreads these supporters out among many districts,

00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:26.417
denying your opponent a lot of votes.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:30.149
When you have a large number of people who would generally vote for one type of party,

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.132
those folks are known as a voting bloc.

00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:35.249
Cracking is a way to break that all up.

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.432
So when would a party choose to pack their opponent's districts rather than crack them?

00:02:39.432 --> 00:02:42.116
Well, that really depends on what the party needs.

00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:45.699
To dilute your opponent's voters, you could pack them into one district

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:49.333
and leave the surrounding districts filled with voters of your own party.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:53.482
Or, if you and your party are in power when it's time to redraw district lines,

00:02:53.482 --> 00:02:56.632
you could redraw districts and crack up a powerful district

00:02:56.632 --> 00:03:00.432
and spread your opponent's voters out across several neighboring districts.

00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:05.048
So, Governor Gerry in 1812 wanted to gain an advantage for his party,

00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:09.600
and redrew district lines in his state in such a crazy way we have a whole new word

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.097
and way of thinking about how political parties can gain advantages over their opponents.

00:03:14.097 --> 00:03:17.866
Politicians think of creative ways to draw districts every few years.

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.548
So the next time an election comes around,

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:22.731
and politicians ask people to vote,

00:03:22.731 --> 00:03:27.398
be sure to look up the shape of your district and the districts that surround it.

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:30.365
How wide does your district stretch across your state?

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:33.583
Are all of the districts in your state relatively the same shape?

00:03:33.583 --> 00:03:36.549
How many other districts does your district touch?

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.182
But always be sure to ask yourself,

00:03:39.182 --> 00:03:41.599
does my district look like a salamander?
