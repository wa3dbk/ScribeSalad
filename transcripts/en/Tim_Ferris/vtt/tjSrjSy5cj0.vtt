00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.020
Hello friends and family.
I am Kevin Rose.

2
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:12.440
Welcome to another edition of the random show.
I am Tim Ferris,

3
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.000
and also welcome to number 347 of the random show.

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.370
I am your bald cohost today.
We're twinsies.
Yes,
yes.

5
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.010
We decide to go for a little shave.
Nice.
I think it's very a suiting.

6
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.140
It feels very flattering.
Really.
You think so?

7
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.080
Your head is bigger than it's like William Shatner.
No,
it's not.

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.460
Our heads are the same size by the way.
We measured them.

9
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:37.580
We measure this conference of our heads and they're actually also match.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.020
Daria says waste.
Oh,
that's right.
My wife's waste is the same.

11
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.810
That's kind of weird.
Why don't we hit what the,
yeah.
One night he came over,

12
00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.760
we did that and we know where are we right now?
We're in the it.

13
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.840
This is this how the man cave?
Is that the man cave?

14
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.830
This is just my office at my house and uh,

15
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.400
I've got a little chalkboard behind this ear.

16
00:00:55.401 --> 00:00:59.240
So sometimes when we're doing a little product brainstorming sessions with a few

17
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:02.420
of my coworkers,
I'm on absolutely want to build stuff like that.

18
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:05.390
We get up here and move the couch away and just light board.

19
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:07.490
I think this was for tiny back in the day,

20
00:01:07.491 --> 00:01:11.900
one of the absolute built about eight months ago.
And yeah,
it's all tiny.

21
00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:14.690
So I haven't touched this.
We got an office so we don't use as much.

22
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.220
And you have sort of an art deco,
uh,

23
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.160
metallics are stainless steel chandelier,

24
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.970
which used to be deer antlers.
Did you swap it out?
Honestly,

25
00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:30.110
this,
this whole room used to be very like man cave.
He,

26
00:01:30.111 --> 00:01:32.440
like you said initially where it was a dark leather,

27
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.990
it's a dark leather big desk with leather on it and stuff.
And I'd just like,

28
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.160
you know,
that was my dad.
That was kind of like what he liked,
you know,

29
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.510
and I wanted to make it seem kind of Woodsy,
which is fine,

30
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.990
but I just wanted a little bit more space and something a little bit more modern

31
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.560
and that's why I got this couch and I don't know.
Um,

32
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.320
so it's kind of turned into this area where now my desks off against the wall.

33
00:01:51.321 --> 00:01:54.320
I've got a bunch of open space in front of me.
I can just come into your lounge.

34
00:01:54.321 --> 00:01:56.810
I got a little aims chair there that can kick back and read a book,

35
00:01:56.811 --> 00:02:00.380
something like that.
So it's going to,
and you have a lot of whiskey.
What?

36
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:03.160
Japanese whiskey.
So what are you drinking today?
Um,

37
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.730
I just got back from Tokyo here a couple of weeks ago and this is a whiskey that

38
00:02:07.731 --> 00:02:11.300
they have yet to release in the United States.
It's um,

39
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.490
they're Hibiki harmony whiskey and so it is a blend of I think four different

40
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.760
whiskeys.
And so he'd beaky is one of my favorite Japanese whiskeys.

41
00:02:19.761 --> 00:02:24.530
I hadn't thoughti whisky.
Suntory.
Yeah.
Um,
so I have a,

42
00:02:24.531 --> 00:02:29.400
I have the 21,
the 30 there.
I also have a 12.
Um,

43
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.480
honestly I think for a day to day drinker this blend,

44
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:36.200
I'm not sure what it would retail for in the states when it does eventually get

45
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:40.800
here in Japan,
I think it was 99 or 100 bucks for a model.
Got It.

46
00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.780
So nothing crazy expensive.
Um,
for our daily Swig.
Yep.
This is just a,
it's,

47
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.580
it's when you're drinking the age whiskeys there,
they're very deep.

48
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:53.000
That will a lot of depth to them and a lot of complexity when they hit your

49
00:02:53.001 --> 00:02:57.820
tongue.
This is just mild chill.
Like you can just kick back on a nice level,

50
00:02:57.821 --> 00:02:58.790
a nice sunny day.

51
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.630
Throw a big cube in there and don't feel like you're killing it.
Cause it's like,

52
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.660
you know it doesn't,
it doesn't.
You know how when you do proper age whiskey,

53
00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:06.670
you don't want to dilute it down to,

54
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.470
<v 2>I just feel like you have to be too precious.
Exactly.
Now if you have those Sam,</v>

55
00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.550
I'll try it a little.
He's not drinking right now.
Good deal.
Don't think sip.

56
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.120
Take a sip.
I'm not going to fake.
Sometimes you fake sip.

57
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.230
Just take a little sip.
But any seen you fake sip?
I don't know.

58
00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:25.750
Sometimes you don't drink that much.
Well that's true.

59
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.720
Meaning I don't drink as much as Kevin Rose.
Listen,

60
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:32.830
I don't drink as much as well.
I guess a decent amount,
but not that much.

61
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.380
I don't drink as much as I am and leaving Las Vegas.
Oh wait.
Yeah.

62
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.820
<v 1>Hey listen.</v>

63
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.400
I've been tracking my drinks as we mentioned in a previous episode in that

64
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.460
spreadsheet.
How's that gum?
I don't drink that much.
I drink a little bit,

65
00:03:44.461 --> 00:03:47.720
but not that much.
Five or six drinks a night?
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

66
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.380
That would be insane.
I was like alcoholic level,

67
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:54.381
like I would say an average night for me is probably like 1.75 all right.

68
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.990
Meaning there's some nights where I had three glasses and there's some nights

69
00:03:57.991 --> 00:03:58.810
where I have zero

70
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.810
<v 2>are using fishbowls as glasses because I know I've told my readers before you</v>

71
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:07.420
can have one glass of red wine at night and they find out all,

72
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.450
they figured out all sorts of creative ways to basically make self-defeating

73
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.000
decisions to drink out of like a fishbowl.

74
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.840
<v 1>So Darren's think I'm kind of,
I think some kind of nut nuts.
My wife,</v>

75
00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:23.100
because I'll come in and I'll actually measure out the ounces of wine into the

76
00:04:23.101 --> 00:04:27.480
glass to make sure I get the rapport.
Because before I was like,
oh,

77
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:31.190
there's like three classes per bottle of wine or four,

78
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.460
but I think it's actually like four and a half or is that

79
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.330
<v 2>all right?
750 mil.
Yeah.
So anyway,</v>

80
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.090
you have to be,

81
00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.850
<v 1>I've also,
I've been measuring it out if I get kind of crazy,
but I'm,</v>

82
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:44.140
I'm loosening up on that stuff a little bit.

83
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:46.720
It was fun to track it for the first few months and I still am,

84
00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.540
but I don't know what the goal is at this point.

85
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:52.120
Like I know how much I drink and I'm pretty comfortable where I'm at.

86
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:55.930
I'd like to look into push,
push the envelope a little up,
up at four or five.

87
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.110
This is interesting.
I want to talk about scaling back on,

88
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:01.780
on this kind of stuff because for me as we get older,

89
00:05:01.781 --> 00:05:04.270
I'm approaching 40 you're approaching 40.

90
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.110
Like we look good to think about that.

91
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.050
While I was going to say 50 blending will be fucked up.
Um,
we,
we like,
you know,

92
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.700
fat sticks to us a lot easier.

93
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.690
And actually we had dinner a couple nights ago and you're on this really funky

94
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:19.760
thing,
love Funky,
but it's like different than your four our bodies,

95
00:05:19.761 --> 00:05:23.140
stuff like that for a sec.
Yeah.
I'm doing

96
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.810
<v 2>and falling what's called the key to genic diet.</v>

97
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.510
[inaudible] so I'm in a ketonic state.
What does that mean?

98
00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.080
That means that I am running on fat predominantly.

99
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:35.470
So my fuel is coming from fat,
my fuel's coming from fat.

100
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.830
And what that means in pragmatic terms is that I am eating probably 80% of my

101
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.080
calories or so from fat,
which is a lot harder to do than you might think.

102
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:47.741
Uh,

103
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:52.741
and then perhaps 15% from protein and 5% or less from carbohydrates.

104
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.100
And I'm doing experiments to see what knocks me out of or not.

105
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:01.160
And the way that you actually just tips,
take a step back.

106
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
If you were to crash in a plan and the flying tomorrow,

107
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:09.940
where are you saying?
Right.
So let's just say that you crash and you're,

108
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.480
you're stuck in the wilderness.
Hold on.

109
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.340
You can survive three hours without shelter.
Three days without water,

110
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.670
three weeks without food.
Okay.
So you can go without food for a long time.

111
00:06:19.671 --> 00:06:23.840
What happens when initially your brain's going to be trying to work,

112
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.771
uh,

113
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:29.330
utilizing glucose and blood sugar and over time that's going to become untenable

114
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:31.100
because you're not consuming carbohydrates.

115
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:33.530
And then we'll start pulling it from the muscles and the liver and so on.

116
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:38.740
Eventually you run out and that's when your body kicks over into utilizing body

117
00:06:38.901 --> 00:06:41.960
fat for fuel and converting it into ketones.

118
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.130
So ketone bodies can be processed by the brain and heart really,
really well,

119
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.690
actually.
They're very helpful for endurance exercise.
So is this good for you?

120
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.530
Like is it,

121
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.980
I heard this a mental fog that happens when you first started going into it.

122
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.860
A transition from glucose dependent,
a ketone,
uh,

123
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.930
adapted or Keto adapted can produce some fog,

124
00:07:02.931 --> 00:07:05.960
but it doesn't have to last more than a day or two.

125
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.120
But for a lot of people it'll take four or five days to get there.

126
00:07:08.121 --> 00:07:12.260
This is essentially the Atkins diet more or less,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
exactly.
And,
uh,

127
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:17.240
so this is a new toy that I've been playing with,
so it's not quite a toy,

128
00:07:17.241 --> 00:07:20.930
but it's a a,
it's a medical device called the precision Xtra.

129
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:25.730
And this looks like,
and is a glucometer,
meaning I,
uh,

130
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:30.260
so I put a needle or you can do this here.
I pop,
I hit my finger,

131
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:31.820
I could do it live.
Maybe I won't do it live.

132
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.510
I've done it on my fingers and it hurts so bad.
Like it can't hurt,

133
00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:36.830
especially if you get,

134
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.090
I was measuring and I had been measuring four times a day and I have two strips

135
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.690
per measurement.
So I'm putting eight sticks in my hand per day,
per day.

136
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.590
Now I don't recommend that talk to your medical professional,
but,
uh,

137
00:07:48.591 --> 00:07:50.930
what's so cool about this particular device?

138
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.400
Or you can go to Walgreens and buy all sorts of glucometers leave.

139
00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:55.950
You didn't talk to your medical professional about your like,
Hey,

140
00:07:55.951 --> 00:08:00.170
I'm a stick myself eight times.
Let's say you're a fucking idiot.
There you go.

141
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:04.720
Alright.
Dr. Rosa is delivered the verdict.
These,

142
00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.040
that's a caveat that I provide because you don't want to get sued.
Yeah.

143
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:11.510
Because someone like sick themselves,

144
00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:15.410
one out of every thousand people out there as a fucking retard and they're going

145
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:19.940
to be like,
oh,
Tim said to stick myself.
No,
fucking stab myself in the eye.

146
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.390
All right,
so talk to your doctor before you fucking stab yourself in the eye.
Um,

147
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:24.410
these,

148
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.760
these particular sticks are for measuring ketone bodies and these are for

149
00:08:28.761 --> 00:08:33.290
glucose,
so you can do both at this device,
which is very,
very interesting.
And uh,

150
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.150
because previously as you know,
and you have,

151
00:08:35.151 --> 00:08:37.460
I see on your desk some Quito sticks.
Well,

152
00:08:37.461 --> 00:08:39.020
I just got this can throw them in those grammar,

153
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.550
that little a white bottle gnome in front of that right there.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,

154
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.270
I got this because you started talking about,
and I was like,
well,

155
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.870
I'm going to try this for like weeks.
And he was saying like,

156
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:50.380
you lose fat like a Mofo,
like you do.
Yeah.

157
00:08:50.381 --> 00:08:52.430
You can have a come cabs like starting to come out.

158
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:57.431
Now my motto ad is slowly becoming maybe a drab,

159
00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.000
we'll move all moving towards a six back.
I've lost a ton of fat and I had some,

160
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.640
I blend my hips apart doing too and eat too many squats,
uh,

161
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.830
for just like squatting on a daily basis for many days straight.
And so I,
uh,

162
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.820
from ability not for,
for hypertrophy and took two weeks off,

163
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:18.780
had my first workout today and all of the weights felt light.

164
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.030
And now I'm not saying that's because of the Diet,
but my joints feel incredibly,

165
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:28.350
uh,
they feel much better than they did two weeks ago.

166
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.480
And I've been on the diet for maybe a week.

167
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:33.570
I'm going to do another probably four or five days and do a secondary round of

168
00:09:33.571 --> 00:09:35.400
blood testing.
But here's,
here's the thing that's interesting.

169
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:39.000
When you go into Ketosis,
there are different ways to measure ketosis.

170
00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.740
So when you pee on these,
you are,
you're,

171
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.730
what this is detecting is a cdot acetate being expelled in the urine.

172
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.510
Uh,
and this is kind of reliable.
You have a color coding on the side,

173
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:55.710
which tells you whether you have negative ketones,
trace small,

174
00:09:55.711 --> 00:09:59.400
moderate or large.
All right Liz.
Then I would rather pee on a stick.

175
00:09:59.401 --> 00:10:01.440
Then you get stab myself eight times a day.
This gets me,

176
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.130
this gives you the millimolar concentration to keep ketones,
which is very,

177
00:10:05.131 --> 00:10:08.090
very specific.
Now the problem with these,
for instance,
um,

178
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.480
you could also measure it with your breath.

179
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:13.590
There's something called a [inaudible] device.
I think that's what it's called.

180
00:10:13.591 --> 00:10:15.270
Ketonic excuse me,
with an end.

181
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.970
And you breathe into it and that will measure acetone.

182
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.530
And so it's also more accurate than this.
The Nutanix,

183
00:10:22.531 --> 00:10:25.950
I would say it's more accurate than this because if you become fat adapted and

184
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:29.340
you've been in Ketosis for a while,
so let's just say Atkins Diet,
whatever,
uh,

185
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:33.480
your body becomes more efficient at processing ketones and you won't excrete as

186
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:34.770
much.
And so you then you'll,

187
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:39.600
you'll pee on this or do you want to be a little more,
uh,
reliable?

188
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:42.630
You can dip it into your urine for 15 seconds,

189
00:10:42.631 --> 00:10:46.470
pull it out and you might come up negative.
But in fact,

190
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.610
you're rocking and rolling.

191
00:10:47.611 --> 00:10:50.730
It's just that your body is not experienced with the breathalyzer thing.

192
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:53.760
Catch that.
The Breathalyzer,
uh,

193
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:58.761
I don't know how adaptive the Acetone expulsion is.

194
00:10:59.101 --> 00:11:02.070
I think that that also probably diminishes over time.
If I had to guess.

195
00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.700
So the holes I,
this was $12 for me at Walgreens.

196
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.050
How much does that to the precision Xtra is not that expensive.

197
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:13.350
You can get it for like 35,
40 bucks now.
But here's the thing.
All right,

198
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:17.780
so that is how much?
12 bucks.
And how many are there?
50.
Yeah.
Okay.
I know these,

199
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:21.900
these,
these are little strips for ketones.
These are like $5 a pop.
Uh,

200
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.700
they're really,
really expensive.
Uh,
so this is cost prohibitive for most people,

201
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:31.700
especially people who are as OCD as me with,
uh,

202
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.240
with sticking themselves three,
four times a day.
So that is the story.

203
00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:39.600
So how much is the breathalyzer thing?
Gosh,
that test toaster for ketones.

204
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.690
Ketones.
Why would you hurt my dog?
Not going to hurt your dog.

205
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.750
Your dog is getting a little buxom.
He's leaves look a little chunky monkey.

206
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:48.500
What do you think he's got an extra for?
We haven't him lately.

207
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.440
He's a,
I don't want to send to super cute.
Come on.

208
00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:59.020
I'm not saying he's fat,
he's just fat her.
Uh,
what else?

209
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:01.780
What else is going on?
Let's say what all on how much of the breathalyzer cost?

210
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:06.310
I don't know.
I think that's between like 102 hundred bucks.
Okay.
Yeah.
So can we,

211
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.250
one thing people are going to be wondering is like you have a very successful,

212
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:13.060
for our body book,
it's kind of like this and that.

213
00:12:13.061 --> 00:12:17.890
I'm sure you do kind of go into ketosis with the foreign body a little,
hey,

214
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.120
you can go into ketosis on slow carb.
It's not the objective,
but it can happen.

215
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:26.680
And I'm logging all of my data secure and then transferring it over to Evernote.

216
00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.330
Everyone is wondering,
why are you doing this?
Uh,

217
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.640
I'm doing it because I constantly test different diets.
Number one.

218
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.640
Number two,
you die.

219
00:12:35.641 --> 00:12:38.990
It is selected based on what you're optimizing for us right now.
Uh,

220
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.590
I have some weird blood markers.

221
00:12:41.591 --> 00:12:46.570
My blood tests have a number of items that have come back really weird and I

222
00:12:46.571 --> 00:12:51.571
want to see if a ketogenic diet changes that.

223
00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.290
And I want to see if it's autoimmune related,
if it's food related.

224
00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:00.650
And so doing a lot of blood testing before and after,
uh,

225
00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.760
for trying to identify,
uh,

226
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.090
how tweaking these variables effects on those things.
That's pretty much it.

227
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.910
You said it was making your joints feel better.
This has done is like,

228
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.560
is it a antiinflammatory diet in some sense?
Well,

229
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:17.770
in this to the extent that a lot of people would consider carbohydrates

230
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:22.580
inflammatory,
uh,
or at least process carbohydrates are those that are,
that are,

231
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.210
that are converted to glucose very quickly.
Uh,
Yep.

232
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.460
Then it would definitely be considered a antiinflammatory diet.

233
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:28.600
Do you think that's impacting?

234
00:13:28.601 --> 00:13:31.230
You said your joints are feeling better now that you're on the side be,

235
00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:34.630
it could also be the fact that I'm consuming 80% of my calories from fat and

236
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:39.430
eating like coconut oil and cheese and all this other stuff that,
uh,

237
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.260
might help lubricate the joints.
And I'm not sure how synovial fluid is,

238
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:47.330
is produced,
which is the,
the fluid that you find in say the knee,
uh,

239
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.730
but feel pretty good.
Now on the flip side,
eating all of this fat,

240
00:13:51.731 --> 00:13:54.160
my skin is not so happy.
Big Surprise,
right?

241
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.610
When you're eating like hunks of metal using cream and coconut oil.

242
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:03.070
My a year sebaceous glands.
That's what kicks out the uh,

243
00:14:03.071 --> 00:14:07.270
the oil,
it causes acne.
Uh,
not so happy.
Pretty grumpy.

244
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.810
So we'll not sure.
Not sure.
I'll do this for a super long period of time.

245
00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:15.580
I do find slow carb a lot easier,
a lot easier.
Uh,
and I just had,

246
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:17.980
for instance,
I'm actually going to test myself while,
while we talk,

247
00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.740
but I had a lead on my couch.
I'm not going to lead on your couch.

248
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:25.090
I had a Kombucha while walking over here that has sugar in it.
Well,
as a grips,

249
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.160
so over the day I'm trying to,

250
00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:31.330
I'm trying to restrain or constrain,
restrict.
There we go.

251
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.740
We're strict my carbs to 30 grams or less for the day and I'm trying to,

252
00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:41.220
I'm trying to restrict my protein to around one gram per kilogram of desired

253
00:14:42.341 --> 00:14:44.240
body weight or lean body weight.
That's it.

254
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:48.460
Typically the same amount that bodybuilders eat when they want to put mass on?

255
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.070
No,
it's a lot like one gram per pound,
per pound of

256
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.220
<v 1>body weight I'm doing killed him.</v>

257
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:58.190
<v 2>It's less than half.
Um,
and you have to really restrict your protein intake.</v>

258
00:14:58.191 --> 00:15:01.250
If you eat tons of protein,
especially if you drink something like whey protein,

259
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.170
which is the simple sugar of proteins,

260
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:08.590
it's the liver will convert that via Gluconeogenesis is what it's called into.

261
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.520
Got the,
we've got the scientist in the background.
Give me the thumbs up,
uh,
into,

262
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:17.570
uh,
well they'll take,

263
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.590
the amino acids will be converted into glucose and certain amino acids are

264
00:15:21.591 --> 00:15:23.920
converted preferentially into glucose.
So there,

265
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.890
<v 1>uh,
Glucogenix as opposed to ketogenic.
So anyway,</v>

266
00:15:28.891 --> 00:15:31.890
it's all very,
very interesting stuff.
One last question for you.

267
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.980
When you're on this day,
can you actually put on mass?
Do you think you could,

268
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.600
if you were lifting,
you'd get bigger?

269
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.350
<v 2>I think it's possible that I could,
but if I were to do it,</v>

270
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.890
if I were to follow this diet and,
and really want to put on mass,

271
00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:47.740
I would either follow what people call the Tkd,

272
00:15:47.741 --> 00:15:51.670
the targeted Ketogenic Diet or what I've done before when I was in college.

273
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.420
Actually,

274
00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:56.770
the cyclical Ketogenic Diet and the cyclical ketogenic diet is very interesting

275
00:15:56.771 --> 00:16:00.580
and it combines well with the mentality and kind of the ethos of the slow carb

276
00:16:00.581 --> 00:16:05.581
Diet because you have 24 to 48 hours each week to binge basically the carb load.

277
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:10.510
So you would follow the Ketogenic Diet from say Monday to Friday on Saturday

278
00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:10.850
morning,

279
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.860
you'd do a glycogen depletion workout and then you would carb load for the next

280
00:16:14.861 --> 00:16:18.080
24 to 48 hours.
I would constrain that to 24.
Uh,

281
00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.780
and I think if you do that and you're taking advantage of insulin is an anabolic

282
00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:27.781
hormone and driving carbs in that that can help fuel you for high intensity

283
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:33.430
workouts for say the next two or three days when you get super advanced like a

284
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.330
Peter,
a Tina,
uh,
who is an MD that I've had on the podcast.

285
00:16:37.331 --> 00:16:41.710
We've talked about all sorts of life extension and performance enhancing,
uh,

286
00:16:41.711 --> 00:16:44.080
techniques and tools and dietary tweaks.
Uh,

287
00:16:44.081 --> 00:16:48.040
he is a ketosis master so he will determine he's a,
he's in that,

288
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.190
he's a long distance cyclist and he also,

289
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.810
well actually he wouldn't consider it longest since he does 20 kilometer time

290
00:16:55.811 --> 00:16:59.770
trials I think is 20 kilometer.
And he will,
he can,

291
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.370
he will quantify the exact number of carbohydrates or grams of carbohydrates,

292
00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:08.820
carbohydrates a he can consume and utilize during exercise without popping out

293
00:17:09.191 --> 00:17:09.980
of Ketosis.

294
00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.480
<v 1>Hmm.
Crazy.
Yeah,
he does something.
He only eats those carbs when he's cycling.</v>

295
00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.340
That's right.
And then when he's done,
he's like,

296
00:17:16.341 --> 00:17:18.710
I didn't pop up cause I just burned everything straight out.
Yeah.

297
00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.430
And he'll measure that based on what he believes his liver can hold.

298
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:25.820
I think it's something like 400 grams or 400 calories.

299
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.710
I think it's probably 400 calories.
No,
maybe 400 grams.
I'm mixing him.

300
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:34.400
I'm not this advanced.
I'm just using one of your podcasts.
Yeah,

301
00:17:34.401 --> 00:17:37.750
he's been on the podcast twice.
Sweet.
I'll go.
I'll go listen.
Get a Tia.
A T,

302
00:17:37.751 --> 00:17:42.290
t I a the guy's amazing.
All right.
What else?
Uh,
so other things,

303
00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.940
Tim's doing weird,
particularly things over there.
I talked about my whiskey.
Um,

304
00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.940
so this is something that I just started getting into,
uh,
last week.

305
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:56.630
And this little guy right here is called the fresh roast sr 700 sr 700.

306
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:02.340
It's like a fake movie name,
Dude.
This is,
this is,
it's like a,
the blackbird,

307
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:07.330
what was that?
The SR 71?
Uh,
that's right.
Yeah.
So,
um,

308
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.750
this is,
uh,
at home coffee roaster.

309
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.490
Like you basically buy the beans,
like straight up green beans.

310
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:19.110
These are coffee beans before they'd been roasted and you can roast your own

311
00:18:19.111 --> 00:18:23.100
beans inside this little machine.
So essentially what you do is you fill this up.

312
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.830
If I'm going to make enough for just one cup of coffee,

313
00:18:25.831 --> 00:18:29.020
I'll put 25 grams of a,

314
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.310
of beans in here and then put little top on here.

315
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:36.680
And this will circulate hot air at around,
Oh you,

316
00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:40.620
there's three different temperature settings,
but the high is around 400 degrees,

317
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.600
um,
which is pretty hot.
Uh,
and it fluffs it like popcorn.

318
00:18:45.601 --> 00:18:47.220
So you'll see these little beans jump.

319
00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.750
It takes about 10 to 15 minutes and then you'll have a perfectly roasted coffee.

320
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.210
It'll do a cool down period.
Um,

321
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.860
and then you take it out and let it grind it after it sits and you have fresh

322
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:00.900
roasted coffee at home.
It's pretty awesome.
That's cool.

323
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:03.900
So I mean it's a way to save money but also at the same time like experimenting

324
00:19:03.901 --> 00:19:06.210
with different types of rows cause you can do your own rose.

325
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:07.950
How do you like to roast coffee?

326
00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.680
Well I just got this thing so I'm really not that far into it.

327
00:19:10.681 --> 00:19:13.830
But one of the things that's really cool about this is it has a Usb port on the

328
00:19:13.831 --> 00:19:18.480
back of it and I plugged it into my computer and you can go in and set your own

329
00:19:18.481 --> 00:19:22.230
cycles so you can set your temperature cycles,
your duration,
and you can have it.

330
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.610
Oh God,
I hate it seemed that,
that hurts dude.
I do that for vitamin D testing.

331
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.090
Um,
oh man.
So anyway,
uh,
check it out.
It's on Amazon.

332
00:19:33.091 --> 00:19:36.930
I will say one thing about that coffee roaster.
Um,
it's not that expensive,

333
00:19:36.931 --> 00:19:41.310
but there have been some people that have issues with the roasts are being

334
00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:43.440
broken when they receive it.
Um,

335
00:19:43.441 --> 00:19:46.560
I had a similar issue where my roaster wasn't getting hot enough.

336
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.050
I did contact them on support.
They were awesome.

337
00:19:49.051 --> 00:19:51.180
They sent me one out without a meeting and this one back.

338
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:54.360
So they're really good on customer service.
We're based out of Utah.
Um,

339
00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.420
it's a fun little hobby.
Some people roast beans in there,
like oven,

340
00:19:57.421 --> 00:19:59.250
they'll put it on a flat pan and restroom beans.

341
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.640
But if you've ever been kind of been curious and wanting to,
uh,

342
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:07.290
you're being curious.
One of the things I will say is a software does not work,

343
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.490
uh,
on the Mac.
So what I did is I downloaded,
uh,
parallels,

344
00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:14.940
launched windows 10 inside of it,
connected it via USB,

345
00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.180
and then ran off from there and it worked just fine.
So anyway,

346
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.440
fun little hobby if you're ever been curious or you get into kind of pour over

347
00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:27.120
coffee at your own house,
this is kind of next level shit.
So,
um,

348
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:28.980
there's all different types of beans that you can buy.

349
00:20:28.981 --> 00:20:32.980
I got these from a place called Sweet Maria's,
which is based out of Oakland.
Uh,

350
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.620
they have a great online store.

351
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.600
Don't lick your fingers if you're watching the video version of this and it's

352
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.880
disgusting and he's bleeding and licking himself when I'm talking about coffee.

353
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:45.690
Um,
anyway,
have fun with it.
It's a,

354
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:48.040
it's a fun gift for the coffee enthusiasts out

355
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.670
<v 2>there.</v>

356
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:51.390
You can get started for under a couple hundred bucks or right around a couple

357
00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.850
hundred bucks.
That is my next thing.

358
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.560
Was it distracting you've workout?
I mean it's just like,
what are you doing dude?

359
00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:04.970
So I have 0.7 point $7 million for Ketones,

360
00:21:05.411 --> 00:21:09.710
which is not as high as I would like it,
which I attribute to the,
yeah,

361
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:13.780
to the eight grams of Kombucha or eight grams of carbohydrate income Mucho,

362
00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.370
which is all sugar even though I walked about two miles to get here.
Um,

363
00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.700
so there,
there you go on and have a glucose of 93,
which is way,
way,

364
00:21:21.701 --> 00:21:25.150
way too high for my,
for my preference.
So that's it.

365
00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:30.210
I'll keep the blood there and off of your kids literally sitting on the couch.

366
00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.310
No,
no,
no.
It's on top of the little.
I know,

367
00:21:33.311 --> 00:21:36.250
but that's just like one toaster jump from being in your blood.
It is,

368
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:40.210
it is definitely one toaster jumps.
A No jumping on the blood toaster.
Uh,

369
00:21:40.211 --> 00:21:45.211
so I have a related suggestion or option for folks and that is,

370
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.370
have you ever done anything with coffee,
by the way?
Are you a coffee guy?

371
00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.300
I like coffee,
either grocery and stuff.
I've never roasted my own stuff.

372
00:21:52.301 --> 00:21:55.480
I've done tons of pour over stuff.
I have the air press at home.

373
00:21:55.481 --> 00:21:57.500
I know that's not a pushover,
but I do have the [inaudible],

374
00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:00.340
the [inaudible] and uh,
there's a,

375
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.420
I think there's a Hario version or is that the vcs and he's 60.

376
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.090
There's a no talking about the blue auto one that goes like this.
And

377
00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:13.030
I have a couple of other options,
but I've been doing mostly t the,
uh,

378
00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.360
the other option for roasting beans that I've seen is using a popcorn.

379
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.260
Yeah.
Roaster.
This is more or less the same thing.

380
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:23.080
The same thing with a little bit more control.

381
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:25.960
And that's what Mark Marin does at home.
I mean,
this thing is,
is,
I mean,

382
00:22:25.961 --> 00:22:28.180
I don't know how much it is.
I can't remember how you paid for it.

383
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:31.770
I want to say it's no more than $250.
And it could have been 150.

384
00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:35.380
I don't remember that.
Anyway,
it's not that expensive.
Maybe he's expensive,

385
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:37.960
but if you're really into it,
it's,
uh,
it's,
it's pretty awesome.

386
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.980
I enjoyed drinking Kombucha,
but clearly on my current diet,
it's,

387
00:22:41.981 --> 00:22:45.430
it's too much of a pain in my ass and is going to knock me out of Ketosis.

388
00:22:45.431 --> 00:22:49.870
So what I might do to try to get the probiotic,
uh,

389
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.700
sort of bacterial benefit of consuming Kombucha is take this stuff.

390
00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:59.760
So this is saccharomyces Boulardii if I'm getting that right.

391
00:23:00.161 --> 00:23:04.170
Plus Mos,
mos is men and oligosaccharides and uh,

392
00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:09.300
these I will be using to repopulate my gut after the antibiotics that I took

393
00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.310
for.
Why this lack of this train though,

394
00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:14.770
that that's what's found in the Kombucha.

395
00:23:14.771 --> 00:23:17.680
So I'm not consuming just that I be consuming this.

396
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:19.800
I'd be consuming some insulin,

397
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:23.770
but Indian Lynn can also spike insulin and contains sugars.

398
00:23:23.771 --> 00:23:25.630
So I have to be cautious of how much I consume.

399
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:29.100
Probably less than 30 grams a day would make obviously a lot of sense from

400
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.310
aiming for a fewer than 30 grams of carbs per day.
And what was that?

401
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:39.540
What was that?
Oh yeah.

402
00:23:39.550 --> 00:23:43.270
It can make you farty that's true.
Yeah.
So those are,
yeah.

403
00:23:43.271 --> 00:23:46.780
Fructo oligosaccharides that can you socially,
uh,

404
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:48.650
inappropriate and unfriendly?

405
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:53.630
Can I prick myself and see where I'm blood your wise?
Uh,
yeah,
sure.

406
00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:57.680
An extra pricker I always have an extra freaker for you.

407
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.670
Uh,
yes I do.
I have an extra printer via clean one.

408
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.110
I'll give you a clean pricker um,
hair.

409
00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.420
Do you want me to do it for you or you want to do,
I want to do it myself.

410
00:24:08.421 --> 00:24:10.070
I just want to make sure you not like double pricking me.

411
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.740
You know how much you like double Frickin,
not even here.
You know,

412
00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.200
you can put it in yourself.
How do you take the lace lid off?
These are like,

413
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.940
you twist it off.
So put this little guy,
he slipped,
man.
Your vocab is killing.

414
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:25.940
Isn't that what is,
what does at least they call it?
That's a land set.
Lancet.

415
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:26.270
Okay.

416
00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.110
But you've got to hold it there and push it down pretty hard so that then it

417
00:24:30.111 --> 00:24:33.880
goes,
it's going to protect me right away.
No,
no,
no.
Yeah.

418
00:24:33.881 --> 00:24:37.180
Get it seated and then you did twist it off.
All right.
All right.

419
00:24:37.181 --> 00:24:40.480
We're going to do this.
Ooh Shit.
And then I have a gift for you.
All right.

420
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.490
You want to put that top on?
Okay.
And then,
um,
your bloods on here.

421
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.780
None of my blood's on there.
I'm going to do like on my arm.
Uh,

422
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:52.870
I mean it's not calibrated for that,
but if you want to do that,

423
00:24:52.871 --> 00:24:55.780
you're welcome to.
You want to do it on your hand?
Yeah,
I don't want to do it.

424
00:24:55.781 --> 00:24:59.710
Like I just don't want to do it in an eye on the fingertips or hurts like a

425
00:24:59.711 --> 00:25:04.330
biatch here.
Gimme that right.
I'm going to do it on my like arm here.
All right.

426
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.840
Go for it.
So I do it over a vein or is that just like Dang Shit,

427
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:13.080
don't do it.
Just do it.
Do a finger finger would be my suggestion.

428
00:25:13.081 --> 00:25:15.180
But if you want to do your hand,
no,
no,
no.
Here we go.

429
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:19.140
It was pushing away instead of two,
which I set it at.
Hold on to is fun.

430
00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:23.190
Let me get this thing.
It's three like further in three.
We'll go further in.
Okay,

431
00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:25.980
here we go.
Alright,
hold on a sec.

432
00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.230
Let me get this ready so you don't have a hass out before we take your

433
00:25:29.231 --> 00:25:34.030
measurement.
If I just passed out on the show,

434
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:38.540
let me go for it.
I'm doing,
I didn't feel anything.
Yeah,
I know.

435
00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.280
It doesn't hurt.
It didn't hurt at all.
And that's not going to be enough.

436
00:25:41.281 --> 00:25:43.320
You're gonna have to do it again.
They're going to have to do it on your fingers.

437
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.640
The same thing.
Just use the same thing.
How do I reload it?

438
00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.300
You pull that thing back.
Okay.
No other side.
Listen.
Yeah.

439
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.110
And then just do your fingertips.
It's not going to work on your form.
Oh,

440
00:25:53.111 --> 00:25:56.050
you know what?
Hold on.
But you're going to need to use the use the alcohol again.

441
00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:58.750
Yeah.
Okay.

442
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:02.620
Should I say it to really get the job done and you seem to be a poor bleeder.

443
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.930
Oh fuck.
I hate this feeling.

444
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:13.030
Alright,
there we go.
I didn't even feel it.

445
00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.400
Yeah.
All right.
Wow,
man,
you really don't bleed very well.
Um,

446
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.290
let me squeeze.
I can get some shit out of it.

447
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:32.050
You are not bleeding.
I need to drink some more alcohol.

448
00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:37.180
No Dude.
They drink alcohol to constrict the blood
and thinking about,

449
00:26:37.181 --> 00:26:38.014
I need to do it again

450
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:47.850
doing it.
You're really shitty.
No,
there's nothing coming out here.
Do the,

451
00:26:47.851 --> 00:26:50.900
you're doing the middle of your finger to the outside edge of your finger right

452
00:26:50.901 --> 00:26:53.280
here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
On the edge.

453
00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.053
<v 3>Okay.</v>

454
00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.580
<v 2>Ah,
that one fucking knows.
Good fucker.
Oh,
that'll probably,
yeah,
there we go.</v>

455
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.530
It's a little better.
Oh,
barely.

456
00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:11.160
Barely.
Keep going.
Oh my God.

457
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.330
I can't believe you're such a shitty bleeder.
Uh,

458
00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:19.950
we're almost there.
We're like halfway there.
You gets here

459
00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:26.410
or there we go.
Oh yeah.
It's close.

460
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:33.450
It's so close.
This is like the sloppiest fucking

461
00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.680
Oh my God.
Yeah.
This is
your folder.

462
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:46.040
All you just touched on you.
God dammit.

463
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:50.970
I'm more pissed that you're wasting my God.
Damn.
There we go.
There you guys.

464
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.153
Oh yeah.

465
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.433
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

466
00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.590
<v 2>Come on you fucking thing.
It says three.
What does that mean?
Oh fuck it.</v>

467
00:27:59.591 --> 00:28:02.710
Errored out because we took to hold back out again.
You again.
No,

468
00:28:02.711 --> 00:28:06.550
this thing won't work.
We'd have to do it again.
Are you kidding?
No,

469
00:28:06.551 --> 00:28:09.070
he tried to lock me.
I'm gonna do one more then pulled back in a sick way again.

470
00:28:09.071 --> 00:28:11.470
Maybe we'll,
no,
this thing's toast.
We're going to have to do another one.

471
00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.810
Oh my God.
I'm bleeding all over the place now.

472
00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.380
Okay,
hold on.
Alright,
hold on.
Sorry.
People will cut it.
Some of this out.
No,
no,
no.

473
00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:24.140
Don't cut this out.
This is Ben.
This is goal.
Uh,
alright,

474
00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.140
so I'm going another finger.
Yup.

475
00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:34.030
This is gonna.
This is a really shitty thing to have to do yourself.

476
00:28:34.031 --> 00:28:35.560
I've already cut myself three times.
Now.

477
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:43.900
You should take it to four.
No.
Three willing to,
Oh,
here we go.

478
00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:49.800
All right,
here we go.
Ready?
Three,
two,
one.

479
00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:53.470
Take you a second to do it.
Ah,
Jesus.

480
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:58.020
I'll wait until you're ready.
Let me get a good amount of,
there we go.
All right.

481
00:28:58.030 --> 00:29:02.750
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
That's funny.
Okay,
now

482
00:29:07.150 --> 00:29:11.320
you have a bandaid.
I don't have a [inaudible] 87 what does that mean?
Is it good?

483
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.470
Is it good?
It's all right.

484
00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:20.590
What were you I was 90 I think.
93 okay.

485
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.180
You're 87 87 and then go,
oh,
there we go.
What does that,
uh,

486
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:28.840
in my wait,
was that a ketone stick or blood sugar one,

487
00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:32.590
but I want to ketone all,
I can do another one if you want.
I got it.
I got it.

488
00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.200
Sorry guys.
We'll cut some of this up.

489
00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:37.863
<v 3>Okay.</v>

490
00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.340
<v 2>It is you got to you if I got enough or good enough.</v>

491
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.110
Okay.
Ketones,
sorry.
This born Jesus.
Turn on.

492
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.450
<v 4>Hold on,
hold on.</v>

493
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:04.980
<v 2>Okay.
All right.</v>

494
00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.740
I guess 0.02 that's my guest.

495
00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:12.790
Now I'm going to give you points of your three.
Oh Shit.
Sorry.

496
00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:18.070
That's what it was.
Subway.
Oh Dude.

497
00:30:18.071 --> 00:30:22.540
How good is that?
Just it,
yeah.
0.3 does that bad.

498
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:24.850
I guess it exactly.
You're not really in Ketosis,

499
00:30:24.851 --> 00:30:28.140
but you can get there a little bit more work.
You're a point there.

500
00:30:28.141 --> 00:30:31.870
I think I said points through three a minute.
Getting there though.
Yeah.

501
00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:35.030
You got a ways to go,
but uh,
but you're getting there swing,

502
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:38.860
but on the Keto sticks,
you wouldn't have that level of granularity.

503
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:42.310
You wouldn't have any way of really telling you go with that dude,

504
00:30:42.311 --> 00:30:45.190
you're bleeding because I have it.
That's why you should suck on your finger.

505
00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:49.810
It'll fix it.
Alright.
That was very exciting.

506
00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:56.320
Okay.
People,
sorry for the,
all right.
Weird episode.
That was great.

507
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:58.840
I have a gift for you.
Okay.
Maybe you can put on your finger.

508
00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:03.620
Don't put any finger,
uh,
this,
this is sue grew.
You ever seen this done?
Oh,

509
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:08.430
it does this.
So it's multiple glue.
It's,
I believe originally from the UK and my,

510
00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:12.910
my mom gave it to me for Christmas last year.
It is kind of,

511
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.270
imagine if,
uh,

512
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.530
like super glue and Plato had a love child.
It'd be something like this.

513
00:31:20.531 --> 00:31:23.440
You can use it to fix anything.
Like if you have a,

514
00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.690
a cracked handle on a pot,

515
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.530
you could fix it and mold it and it won't stick your fingers and then it will

516
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:31.970
solidify and it will,
it'll,
it,

517
00:31:31.971 --> 00:31:36.670
it'll become completely held together for those hard to glue things.
Yep.

518
00:31:36.671 --> 00:31:39.700
You could use it for repairing,
saying iPhone cases cracked.
You could use it.

519
00:31:39.701 --> 00:31:42.610
It's not really solely glue.
You could actually people,

520
00:31:42.611 --> 00:31:47.560
I've seen people use Subaru to make mounts for cameras.
Um,

521
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.020
I've seen them use it for turns into rubber is what it's saying.
Yeah.

522
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.050
The 24 hours.
Yeah.
Basically.
Yeah,
exactly.
Huh.

523
00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:58.580
It's a moldable glue that turns into rubber so you could make toys out of it.

524
00:31:58.581 --> 00:32:01.990
You can do just about anything crazy.
Pretty cool.
Awesome.
Thanks Dan.
Yeah,

525
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.970
definitely.
So how did you,
I mean,
is this,

526
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.700
you had this land rent at home or why did you decide to give me this gift today?

527
00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:11.230
I appreciate it because I liked the stuff and I got so,
so,
uh,

528
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:15.760
I figured out pass that along.
Awesome.
And uh,
so other,

529
00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.440
other stuff that people may not have seen before,
uh,

530
00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:23.680
this is an antiinflammatory Gel,
which is pretty controversial,
uh,

531
00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.030
partially because it's,
see,

532
00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:30.520
it's labeled as homeopathic and I have issues with so called homeopathic

533
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:33.640
medicine and I've written about this before so you can search Tim Ferriss,

534
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:36.400
homeopathic medicine if you want to see my take on it.
But,
um,

535
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.700
the short version that generally homeopathic medicine has no evidence for its

536
00:32:41.781 --> 00:32:44.420
efficacy.
But,
uh,
this stuff,

537
00:32:44.421 --> 00:32:49.421
trauma meal is incredibly effective for injury repair and for antiinflammatory

538
00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:55.040
purposes.
If you have some type of,
of tear or otherwise.

539
00:32:55.041 --> 00:32:58.340
So I use this stuff all the time.
I did mention this in the four hour body.

540
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:00.020
Is it like a been gay type stuff?

541
00:33:00.021 --> 00:33:03.530
Like we're just burns and feels good and kind of loosens up the muscle or it's

542
00:33:03.531 --> 00:33:05.780
not just say the Menthol,

543
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:10.730
typically the venues of the world use menthol and so on for that.

544
00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:11.660
Um,

545
00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.660
this seems to have some type of curative effect or restorative effect,

546
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:20.600
not just a temporary numbing effect.
Um,

547
00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:24.380
so these is like post workout.
Like what are you primarily using this for?
Like,

548
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:25.750
well,
I tore,
I,

549
00:33:25.751 --> 00:33:29.270
I have a minor tear of my right hamstring at the insertion point at the hip.

550
00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:33.110
So I'm using this,
I could have used this like a year ago when I ripped a muscle.

551
00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.120
This stuff's great for that.
So,
um,

552
00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.730
I've seen some miraculous recoveries including this.

553
00:33:37.731 --> 00:33:42.600
This isn't sufficient by itself.
But if you were to combine this with say,
uh,

554
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:49.120
some,
uh,
electric stimulation with a device like the mark to uh,

555
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.930
or some type of ultrasound and then apply this,

556
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.960
this,
uh,
this,
this can work some wonders.
So anyway,

557
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:59.990
for those people who haven't seen it traumeel easy to find now.

558
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:01.040
It used to be really hard to find.

559
00:34:01.041 --> 00:34:04.880
Now I think you can get it at whole foods and they're also a ingestible
versions,

560
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:07.460
but I tend to use the topical sweep.
Yeah.

561
00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:10.580
<v 1>What else do you have a,
so a couple things.
One,</v>

562
00:34:10.581 --> 00:34:15.581
I decided to do a experiment and ventured down into some more photography and

563
00:34:16.971 --> 00:34:20.530
um,
I picked up this camera.
A buddy of mine recommended this camera.

564
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:25.810
It's a Leica.
Um,
this is the em dash p and a

565
00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.410
<v 2>feel how heavy that thing is.
First of all,</v>

566
00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.020
I don't know if you've ever messed around with a Leica before.
Uh,

567
00:34:30.021 --> 00:34:33.350
I do not have any like,
uh,
but that is a heavy camera.

568
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:36.700
<v 1>Yeah,
it's,
it's pretty bad ass.
So I just got this,
I'm just learning about it.
Um,</v>

569
00:34:36.701 --> 00:34:39.460
if any people have any recommendations or they actually shooting like as of any

570
00:34:39.461 --> 00:34:42.370
good books that I can pick up,
um,
I would love to hear them.

571
00:34:42.371 --> 00:34:44.170
So just tweet at me at Kevin Rose.

572
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.230
But the thing I love about this is it's completely manual.

573
00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:50.680
Like everything from sending the f stops up here,
there is no auto focus,

574
00:34:50.681 --> 00:34:53.910
so you manually focus up here,
you get your shutter speed right here,

575
00:34:53.911 --> 00:34:57.910
set your ISO in the back,
like everything is manual.
So you know,

576
00:34:57.911 --> 00:35:00.730
you probably nail like one in every 10 photos,

577
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:05.500
but when you nail one it's just like unbelievable and it's very beautiful and it

578
00:35:05.501 --> 00:35:09.190
has a very kind of vintagey feel like,
let me show you some of these uh,

579
00:35:09.191 --> 00:35:11.110
these photos that I'll give a

580
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.250
<v 2>oh,
is that only have one on their team and I only have one on there.
Um,
I,</v>

581
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:19.210
I sucked him off and I told him to delete on my computer but sucked them all
out.

582
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:24.540
You guys have been,
you've been drinking.
I love that.
My wife is like double,

583
00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:26.600
double brickton sucking.

584
00:35:30.390 --> 00:35:33.060
How was it that sucked them all off.
Got Your anyway,

585
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.190
so like of stuff

586
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.130
<v 1>is fun.
Uh,
I'll give grandma a couple of photos that you can put on here,</v>

587
00:35:41.131 --> 00:35:45.390
but it creates these really very beautiful vivid photos.
Um,

588
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:47.460
if you're into,
I dunno,

589
00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.510
I'm kind of like getting into this stage of my life where I liked more manual

590
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:53.730
things.
Like I'm not about technology,

591
00:35:53.731 --> 00:35:55.740
I'm trying to get away from it a little bit.
One of the,

592
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:56.880
one of the models that they have,

593
00:35:56.881 --> 00:35:58.350
I think that you'll think this is kind of interesting.

594
00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:02.340
They have this special edition version of that camera is digital camera.

595
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:05.580
No LCD on the back,
no preview.

596
00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.030
So you take the photos and we literally hook it up to your computer and you

597
00:36:09.031 --> 00:36:12.900
can't sit there and look like until you actually suck them off forcing you,

598
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:21.630
you can't see what they look like.
It's a cycle off.
This is like a mystery party.

599
00:36:22.890 --> 00:36:24.810
Glory Hole.
This is exciting.

600
00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:30.280
I love it is my wife is like

601
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.290
them all.

602
00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:43.650
But I know what you mean about manual illiteracy and just wanting to use your

603
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:47.730
hands more to build things and to do things as opposed to simply being in front

604
00:36:47.731 --> 00:36:49.390
of a screen,
uh,

605
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:53.520
eight to 16 inches away from blue light or even like,

606
00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.410
so by the time this happens it hits the,
a apple watch will be out and it's like,

607
00:36:58.411 --> 00:37:00.360
what do you think about that?
Are you going to get one of those?
I,

608
00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.600
I'm not going to get one because I have enough devices.
I don't need a watch.

609
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.980
I have time on my phone.
I don't need to put,

610
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.960
and I don't need to read you racked with anything else,
but anything pull you in.

611
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:12.480
Like let's say the center has got really good and you could monitor,

612
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.500
well you can real time,
24,
seven heart rate with it.
That's interesting.
Yeah,

613
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:18.100
it's okay.
Um,
events,

614
00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:20.610
the data is only interesting to me and so much as I can use it.

615
00:37:20.611 --> 00:37:24.780
So I'm probably not going to do much with that then.
Yeah,
I feel like it's,
I,

616
00:37:24.781 --> 00:37:27.240
I'm going to get one because I have two and a half to play within all that,

617
00:37:27.241 --> 00:37:31.780
but I just don't need more.
You,
you don't,
if you,

618
00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:35.310
you ever try and text him after 6:00 PM it just doesn't go through.

619
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.900
You shut your phone off.
Yeah.
I put my phone on,
on a airplane,
on airplane mode.

620
00:37:39.901 --> 00:37:42.890
Like it's on airplane mode right now.
But you do that all the time?
I do.
Yeah.

621
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:44.400
Why is that?
Uh,

622
00:37:44.401 --> 00:37:47.700
because I don't want to be reactive and I don't want to feel like I have the

623
00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:50.170
universe going,
hey,
hey,
fuck face,
which is what it is,

624
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:52.800
which is what getting messages feels like to me.
Well,

625
00:37:52.801 --> 00:37:55.220
and that's the problem with the,
the Apple Watch,
to be honest.

626
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.530
Like I want more of that.
I was with a buddy to this morning,

627
00:37:58.531 --> 00:38:02.940
we had coffee and he had went on and he was just like,
and it was just like,

628
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:05.140
I'm like,
what are we looking at there?
What was that?
And he's just like,
oh,

629
00:38:05.141 --> 00:38:07.530
it was just a little thing and let me know about this and that.
And I was like,

630
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:11.700
I don't know,
man,
that just seems like one more,
our brains are like,

631
00:38:11.701 --> 00:38:12.750
I don't know how you feel about this,

632
00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:15.990
but when you get 30 tabs open in your web browser and you're doing all these

633
00:38:15.991 --> 00:38:18.510
different things,
there's no focus anymore.

634
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.920
And all of a sudden that that plays out in how you see everything.

635
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.330
And I worry that like,

636
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:28.560
I have a hard enough time keeping a conversation with my wife or anyone else at

637
00:38:28.561 --> 00:38:31.770
dinner.
Like with my phone sitting there,
it's like,
you know,

638
00:38:31.771 --> 00:38:33.870
we always have this like,
she's like,
can you put your phone away?

639
00:38:33.871 --> 00:38:35.980
Like it says it like multiple times a week.

640
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.150
<v 2>Yeah.
And it's important.</v>

641
00:38:37.151 --> 00:38:40.450
It's important that we get this stuff out of an off of us.
No,
I agree.

642
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:43.480
That's why I think,
you know,
putting your phone on airplane mode,

643
00:38:44.530 --> 00:38:45.281
at the very least,

644
00:38:45.281 --> 00:38:48.220
I put my phone on airplane mode and I put it face down when I'm having dinner.

645
00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.220
Uh,
typically since it's on airplane mode or I have it awful,

646
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:52.570
just put it my punishing you a different mode.

647
00:38:52.571 --> 00:38:57.400
Do you know about the little sleepy mode?
Uh,
I have used do not disturb mode,

648
00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:01.310
but this is also a chance to show people that maybe this wasn't,
uh,

649
00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.780
so I've upgraded to the tablet and the phone,
tablet,
worst case ever.

650
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.340
Why don't you get that case?

651
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:09.190
Because I care less about how it looks and I care more about it.

652
00:39:09.191 --> 00:39:11.680
Preventing my phone from breaking.
No,
I know,
but there's a nice leather ones.

653
00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.290
I'll get you one.
So in any case,

654
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.730
I got this monstrous thing and a,
I'm quite fond of it.

655
00:39:18.731 --> 00:39:22.810
And in part of the reason I'm fond of it is I experimented with going without my

656
00:39:22.811 --> 00:39:26.740
laptop,
but I don't like tapping on the iPhone screen.
I hate,

657
00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:31.870
I hate producing content with my thumbs.
It makes me insane and it's really slow.

658
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:35.290
So what I ended up doing,
uh,
when I was traveling,

659
00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.600
so it's not using vanity fair,

660
00:39:37.601 --> 00:39:42.280
but rather using this tiny thing that I can put inside a magazine or a book to

661
00:39:42.281 --> 00:39:45.850
protect it.
This is a logic keyboard that's uh,

662
00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.590
that's Bluetooth and you just,
you turn it on,
just,

663
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:54.730
you flip the switch here and I can balance this phone.
It's not really balancing.

664
00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:58.870
Lean it against like a glass of water or something and then type in the same way

665
00:39:58.871 --> 00:40:03.670
that I would type on a laptop but I'm only traveling with that and to have those

666
00:40:03.671 --> 00:40:06.190
like Microsoft server,
you could just get an iPad two and do,

667
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.720
I don't like I had snow because then I have this plus basically half of the

668
00:40:10.721 --> 00:40:12.070
laptop.
Do you what I mean it's,

669
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:15.820
it's bigger and I don't need a larger screen than this for most of the type

670
00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:18.940
thing that I do and the fact that we feel this thing,
how light that is,

671
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.090
it's so light,
so I hadn't,
the battery life lasts eight.

672
00:40:22.091 --> 00:40:25.360
We'll ages once you've charged it up via USB,
it's actually pretty good.

673
00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.600
It's really light.
I have a the new air coming.
Have you seen it?

674
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.290
I haven't ate super tiny dude like half the size last ones.

675
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.410
Sorry.
It's not there anymore.

676
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:37.270
It's just all imac was so I didn't get the brand new.

677
00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:41.500
I just got a new Mac book and I made sell it.
What size is it?
It's fine.

678
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:45.550
It's a 13 inch.
The new one is like that dude.
And it's like that thin,

679
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:49.270
it's insane.
Like if you're looking for portability,
that's the only one to get.

680
00:40:49.330 --> 00:40:54.310
Yeah.
So in any case that is another experiment in mobility.
I think this is,

681
00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:59.210
is a,
is going to be super useful for 99% of what I do.
Cool.
Um,

682
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:04.000
aside from,
from storage and then,
uh,
let's see,

683
00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:08.730
this is,
this is kind of funny,
but um,
so this,
this is the book that I've got a,

684
00:41:08.740 --> 00:41:13.600
it's not a book,
it's a magazine mark.
So I have been like,
I feel like,

685
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.100
I feel like a,
this is,
people might get pissed about this,
but whatever.

686
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:21.230
I feel like a bride to be.
Maybe not you,
Daria.
I'm not sure.

687
00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.180
But a lot of women who feel like all like,
no,
no,
no,
like go wedding crazy.

688
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.890
I'm not saying,
I don't know if you did or not,

689
00:41:26.891 --> 00:41:29.170
but a lot they have all the wedding magazines.
Do you what I'm talking about?

690
00:41:29.171 --> 00:41:33.740
She never had one.
But anyway.
Ah,
okay.
So anyway,

691
00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:37.730
when people are getting ready for something,
a big event like getting married,

692
00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.600
having a kid,
they start reading all the baby magazines,
parenting magazines,

693
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.960
the wedding magazines,
whatever the hell.

694
00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:46.420
And so I've been putting off getting a dog.
So I started reading magazines

695
00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:52.340
and the cover is what got me all you need,

696
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:56.510
all you need is love with this dog.
Like,
and I was like,
Oh,

697
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:00.860
I got stabbed in the heart.
And so this is about,

698
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:03.860
is San Francisco's you get uh,
the sub,

699
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.400
the sub title is dog is my copilot.
That's funny.
Okay.

700
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:10.100
And then it's the dog culture magazine.

701
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:14.180
It's just like the most SF hipster thing imaginable.
So what do you,

702
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:16.490
have you narrowed it down to any breeds yet?
What is pretty good?

703
00:42:16.491 --> 00:42:19.550
Actually I was enjoying reading yesterday,
had the history of the seeing eye dog,

704
00:42:19.551 --> 00:42:22.460
which I was very excited about.
Uh,
I'm going to get a dog and we rescue.

705
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:24.260
It'll definitely be a rescue and it's,

706
00:42:24.261 --> 00:42:29.261
it's a matter of just doing it and stop stopping all the thinking I think is

707
00:42:29.811 --> 00:42:33.290
what it comes down to.
I think there's no good time to get a dog,

708
00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:37.550
have baby make any huge decision.
You just have to,

709
00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.830
that's going to really do it.
And then you're a world traveler.
It's tough.

710
00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:44.240
I am,
but I,
you know,

711
00:42:44.241 --> 00:42:48.200
I love San Francisco so much and I'm spending more time in La and then New York,

712
00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:52.190
it's really three locations where I spend 90% of my time and if I'm going to be

713
00:42:52.191 --> 00:42:53.480
gone for any period of time,
I would take,

714
00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:57.590
figure out a way to take the dog with me.
So I'm not too too worried about that.

715
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:02.070
Um,
I think in smaller size,
bigger size,
what do you pay?
Like 30 pounds.
30,
40.

716
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.420
Yeah.
It will be interesting.
I need to,
I need a dog that I can kind of swap,

717
00:43:05.421 --> 00:43:09.480
play with and wrestle,
play with without wondering if I'm going to get up

718
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:16.150
somehow dislocate a hip or a juicer.
Gimme the toaster.

719
00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:20.360
It's very hesitant.
Hey,
go.
Telstra is a 25 pounds,

720
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:25.670
25 pounds in growing.
He's a good guy.
Cores,
light and grain.

721
00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.760
It's going on now.
He doesn't drink.
It doesn't drink.
Oh,
that's right.

722
00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.030
[inaudible] has the most incredible negative response to alcohol I've ever seen,

723
00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:35.080
which is just witness.
You go like this with a glass of wine.

724
00:43:35.081 --> 00:43:39.050
He just back pedals from like five feet away from the glass.
Yeah,

725
00:43:39.051 --> 00:43:41.180
he does not like here.
Here's an example of toast.

726
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.760
Torture him.
I tell him to come here.
It's okay.
All right,
so I've got,
I've,

727
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:54.500
I've a book to share with people.

728
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:58.180
<v 1>Well,
hold on.
You've been like three in a row then,
right?
Go,
go,
go,
go for it.
So,</v>

729
00:43:58.181 --> 00:44:02.890
um,
I have a quarterly box coming out similar to Tim's quarterly box.

730
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:07.960
Um,
I think mine is,
I don't know my URL anyway,
you can search Google quarterly.

731
00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:11.770
Kevin Rose in my next box and whether you subscribe to my box or not,

732
00:44:11.771 --> 00:44:14.200
I really don't care.
I'm just telling you about this.

733
00:44:14.201 --> 00:44:16.090
This is matcha tea from breakaway.
Watch it.

734
00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:18.940
You've had this before break way before,
right?
It's good.
It's great.

735
00:44:18.941 --> 00:44:23.941
Montia for people that don't know and people like myself that have way too much

736
00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:28.260
caffeine in their life or I should say too much coffee in my life and you want

737
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.190
something that's a little bit more healthy and a change.

738
00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:35.490
Macia is essentially the entire leaf of the tea plant ground up.

739
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.870
So they take these um,
very large,

740
00:44:40.050 --> 00:44:43.260
very heavy kind of um,
what does it there may out of there man.
Huh?

741
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.650
You seen these connectors?

742
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:49.530
They're stone but they're heavy stones and they grind them into a very fine

743
00:44:49.531 --> 00:44:54.200
green powder.
So this is kind of what a actually thought open.
Uh,

744
00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:56.760
but you don't want to spill it on your website.
We can show you,

745
00:44:56.761 --> 00:44:59.370
we can show you a picture online but you take a little,

746
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:01.860
what I do is I take a little tiny scoop of this,

747
00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.400
put it in the bottom and then add a little bit of hot water just about that
much.

748
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:10.230
Buy a coffee for author and then you use that in froth.

749
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:13.950
The very bottom of it,
it'll create this almost like foamy type substance.

750
00:45:13.951 --> 00:45:17.670
And then you add more hot water and you have like a green tea latte.

751
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.740
It's a great caffeine boost.
Um,
and it's just the foam.
Awesome.
Yeah.

752
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:25.600
Well you don't get as much hand that way.
It's,

753
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:31.500
well,
we don't want that.
I like,

754
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:36.320
I like a good for me head on the anti much.
Of course it's like I,

755
00:45:36.321 --> 00:45:39.960
it's better to start off and do it at initially rather than wait until the end.

756
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.410
Then you suck them all off and get the double Prek.

757
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.140
I'm the one drinking and you're the one,
oh,
it was amazing.
No,

758
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:52.800
I want this to continue.
I can just do my last one.
Oh good.
All right.

759
00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.300
This is awesome.
Uh,
do you know what does this,

760
00:45:57.301 --> 00:46:00.930
I don't think I can guess.
So this,
okay.

761
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.120
Go ahead and guess fermenting.
Correct.
So,
um,

762
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:10.110
don't say.com and so this is a gift I actually owned fermenting dot.
Come on.

763
00:46:10.111 --> 00:46:12.200
That's why it's funny.
I'm doing nothing with Oh yeah.

764
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:16.930
So if you ever want to do something with it,
I'm good.
But somebody in the,
uh,

765
00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:21.280
so internet as people that we've talked about this before on the show fermenting

766
00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:23.610
is great.
Um,
you get a lot of a helpful,

767
00:46:23.611 --> 00:46:27.570
friendly bacteria that grow on fermented foods and it also makes a lot of foods

768
00:46:27.571 --> 00:46:31.030
more bioavailable.
Thanks Ben.
Um,

769
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:33.450
and basically what this vessel is,

770
00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:37.770
my good friend Tony Conrad gave this as a gift for my birthday.

771
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:38.730
And this is a,

772
00:46:38.730 --> 00:46:43.730
a a clay vessel that is made by a company called a counterculture pottery.

773
00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:49.740
And so these two guys right here,
these are two little clay tablets.
Um,

774
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:53.630
and what happens is you start off with whatever you want to ferment.

775
00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.980
So in this case,
what I like to do a lot of is sauerkraut.

776
00:46:55.981 --> 00:46:59.400
So you follow a simple little recipe.
It's as easy as taking some cabbage,

777
00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:02.580
kind of Michigan all together with some salt,
adding some caraway seeds,

778
00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:05.590
whatever else you want to add.
You put it in here and then you,

779
00:47:05.591 --> 00:47:07.830
you take these apart and these are your weights.

780
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.970
And then what happens is when that all those cell walls of the cabbage
breakdown,

781
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.820
they put off a lot of just basically water.

782
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.310
And when these weights sit on top of the cabbage,

783
00:47:17.311 --> 00:47:19.380
it pushes it down beneath the waterline.

784
00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.630
So they're fully submerged underneath the fluid,

785
00:47:21.631 --> 00:47:24.810
which is important because you don't want that exposed cabbage floating out

786
00:47:24.811 --> 00:47:28.890
there and getting kind of like contact with air.
So after that's done,

787
00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:32.470
you have in the kettle,
you're ready to ferment them for a couple of weeks.
Yeah,

788
00:47:32.471 --> 00:47:34.750
you put the lid on.
Now most people think,
okay,
well that's it.

789
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:39.220
But that's not the reason why there's this little groove right here is you

790
00:47:39.221 --> 00:47:40.840
filled this groove with water.

791
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.650
And then what happens is as is for men's and the gas tries to escape.

792
00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:48.820
What you want is the gas they get out,
but no more air to get in.

793
00:47:48.821 --> 00:47:52.060
You don't want anything contaminating the fermentation as it's going on.

794
00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.510
So it's all,
yeah,
so it's solid.

795
00:47:55.511 --> 00:47:59.590
So what happens is it'll bubble and little bubbles would come out of the side

796
00:47:59.591 --> 00:48:04.090
here,
but the air,
the air,
right?
So that comes out to the water.

797
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:07.630
That's very clever with that.
Or bacteria,
which is the most important thing.

798
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:09.820
You don't want bacteria getting in there cause this is like,

799
00:48:09.821 --> 00:48:13.780
you've got a lot of like warmth and fermentation going on in here.
So that's it.

800
00:48:13.781 --> 00:48:18.670
This is,
this is by far,
you'll see a lot of these on Amazon.
A bunch of are crap.

801
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.950
I can't believe my friend found this.
This is by far.

802
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.990
I've been into fermenting for a while.

803
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:27.360
I've looked at a ton of different vessels by far the best.
So culture,
pottery,

804
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:32.020
counterculture,
pottery correctly.
Yeah.
So I don't know how much it was a gift.

805
00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:35.170
I don't know how much she's run.
I didn't look it up and I'm not going to,

806
00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.560
but it's beautiful.
It is like this is awesome.

807
00:48:38.561 --> 00:48:40.420
If you want to get into fermenting in a serious way,

808
00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:43.660
they have some great recipes in here to this little instruction booklet.

809
00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:48.080
It is so simple to do your own sauerkraut.
Seriously.
If you've never tried it,
um,

810
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.920
I recommend it.
That is all I have

811
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.220
<v 2>today.
All right,
so I've got two more things to talk about this too.</v>

812
00:48:55.221 --> 00:48:59.880
I don't know if you want to talk about this.
Oh,
sure.
We can talk about this.
Uh,

813
00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:02.030
well,
I mean,
I'm going to need you to elaborate here,

814
00:49:02.031 --> 00:49:04.820
but I've been getting on my very,

815
00:49:04.821 --> 00:49:08.660
very boring ketogenic diet eating eggs.
But the,

816
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:13.670
one of the ways to make eggs more interesting for me is to just perfect soft

817
00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:18.500
boiled eggs where you have this like delicious,
almost caramel,
like,

818
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.630
uh,
nectar of the yolk inside the egg,

819
00:49:23.631 --> 00:49:27.160
which is effectively the soft layers har.
Yeah.

820
00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.520
Anyway,
so I love softball.
Boiled eggs,
the neck by the room.
But there are,

821
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:41.330
this is where this is a performance Kevin video show.
Anyway.

822
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.820
So yeah,

823
00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.330
part of the challenge is if you're trying to really get the perfect softball egg

824
00:49:47.331 --> 00:49:50.630
and you don't boil the egg long enough,

825
00:49:50.631 --> 00:49:54.050
then it just comes out as this just like my asthma of disgusting goop and then

826
00:49:54.051 --> 00:49:58.280
it's no good.
Right.
So,
uh,
so when I'm,
when I'm doing a,

827
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.730
generally I am doing,
uh,

828
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:05.180
I like to use baking soda if possible,
which will reduce adherence to the shell.

829
00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:09.830
Uh,
but I will get it to a boil the water that is,

830
00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:14.480
and then I will reduce it to a low boil sort of low turbulence,

831
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.810
add the eggs in and leave them in for about five minutes.

832
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.940
Usually five to six minutes is kind of perfect for me,

833
00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.790
but it's still a bit of guesswork.
Uh,

834
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.270
and this device you guys told me about when we went out to dinner the other

835
00:50:26.271 --> 00:50:30.380
night,
which is effectively a steamer as I understand it,

836
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:34.970
it's amazing and it's a single use device that will give you perfect softball

837
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:38.870
decks.
And I was like,
oh my God,
I don't generally have single use devices.

838
00:50:38.871 --> 00:50:40.810
Darian doesn't ever really,

839
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:42.740
<v 1>but this is the one you guys use this.
Yeah,</v>

840
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:47.450
I bought this thing in our egg hen years ago and uh,

841
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:50.210
well let me show you how it works.
Yeah.
So it's pretty straight forward.

842
00:50:50.211 --> 00:50:53.060
All you do is,
this is the base plate that gets hot.

843
00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.610
You add in like two tablespoons

844
00:50:57.210 --> 00:51:00.840
<v 5>how much oil you want and how many eggs you have.</v>

845
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:05.060
<v 1>Right?
There's a little recipe in the water,
but it tells you how much to put in.</v>

846
00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.680
So anyway,
I was just like generalizing.

847
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:08.180
You add just a little bit of water in the bottom.

848
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.760
Then you put the eggs inside of these little holes right here.

849
00:51:10.761 --> 00:51:12.440
So you set them in,
boom,
boom,
boom.

850
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:15.620
If you want to actually crack the eggs up and put them into here,

851
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:18.800
this will make poached eggs.
Um,
and then,
I don't even know,

852
00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:21.800
I never knew what these were for.
Did you find that name?
Oh,
that's more,

853
00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:26.180
I don't know.
Anyway,
all I ever did was put them in there.

854
00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:29.780
You put the lid on and like you hit this little switch right here on and it

855
00:51:29.781 --> 00:51:31.040
automatically shuts itself off.

856
00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:35.390
<v 5>It's is because it's just off in the water on that.</v>

857
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:38.470
<v 1>Right,
right.
Okay.
Got It.
So you,
yeah.
You need to get the amount of water</v>

858
00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:41.820
<v 5>right.
Kevin lost a piece,
but the most important pieces</v>

859
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.113
<v 1>I did lose that.</v>

860
00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:49.470
<v 5>Or uh,
like you basically are like,</v>

861
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.570
I want four eggs,
software and okay,

862
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.710
<v 1>I see a measuring cup.
Okay,
that's awesome.</v>

863
00:51:57.740 --> 00:52:00.590
That's the magic amount because that determines the duration and everything.

864
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:04.440
Cool.
It's so easy.
And this thing,
I think it was Alandra 30 bucks.

865
00:52:04.441 --> 00:52:08.220
It's not that expensive.
Cool thought that years and years ago.
Uh,

866
00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.310
this is a book that

867
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.150
<v 2>not many of you have seen.
Probably it is,</v>

868
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:18.220
it is a new book as I understand it and it is called a wrestling life.

869
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.270
And the,
uh,

870
00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:25.410
wrestling life is a collection of stories about Dan Gable and by Dan Gable.

871
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:29.960
And,
uh,
I never give cover quotes,
just don't do it.

872
00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:34.310
But Dan Gable was and still is a hero of mine.
And when I was growing up,

873
00:52:34.311 --> 00:52:38.420
because he was sportsman of the century according to this sports illustrated,

874
00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:43.550
he is one of the best coaches of last hundred years and widely considered that

875
00:52:43.551 --> 00:52:45.110
in any sport.
Uh,

876
00:52:45.111 --> 00:52:50.111
he won the gold medal in the Munich Olympics in wrestling without having a

877
00:52:50.691 --> 00:52:51.860
single point scored on him,

878
00:52:51.861 --> 00:52:54.380
which is like winning Wimbledon without having points scored on you.

879
00:52:54.381 --> 00:52:56.700
It's just impossible.
And uh,

880
00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:00.050
he was able then to take that people thought he was already at the pinnacle.

881
00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:04.250
Okay.
It's all downhill from here as it,
as it is the case for a lot of athletes.

882
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:08.270
And then he went into coaching and was able to just produce monsters on demand.

883
00:53:08.271 --> 00:53:13.271
He created this just factory of mutants and I think he had something like 200

884
00:53:13.941 --> 00:53:18.760
plus a somewhere between 150 200 all Americans out of that one,
uh,
uh,

885
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:22.640
out of,
uh,
the Iowa Hawkeyes and 10,
I'm sorry.

886
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:26.390
So I think it was like 13 big 10 in a row and,

887
00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:30.030
and that might be getting some of the facts a little off.
But,
uh,
he was,

888
00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:33.750
he only lost one match and his entire Ncaa career,
which was his last match,

889
00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:36.780
that's why he was so pissed that he trained seven hours a day,

890
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:41.790
seven days a week before the Munich Olympics and just rolled through everybody.

891
00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.210
Uh,
and he is really aggressive.

892
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.480
So I did put up a blog post at one point called Ode to aggression,

893
00:53:48.481 --> 00:53:52.650
which has a clip of 10 Gable,
a coaching his wrestlers,

894
00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:56.580
which is phenomenal.
So Google that,
oh,
do aggression,
Dan Gable.

895
00:53:56.820 --> 00:54:01.200
But my quote that I,
that I gave because I think it's very appropriate,

896
00:54:01.201 --> 00:54:05.190
is in a modern world of political correctness and glad handing the art of the

897
00:54:05.191 --> 00:54:08.490
fight is highly undervalued,
allowed Dan to show you another way,

898
00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:13.110
because Dan is a fighter.
Uh,
and uh,
that's it.

899
00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.070
So this book,

900
00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:19.130
you can check it out if you want to get an inkling of why I'm so fascinated with

901
00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:24.320
Dan gable a as is John Irving for instance,
who's,
who calls Dan Gable,

902
00:54:24.330 --> 00:54:28.610
one of his heroes meeting him changed my life.
Uh,
his life as a wrestler,

903
00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:32.490
as a coach,
as a man dedicated to his family,
has served me as a model.
Uh,

904
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:37.110
and it just,
it's an amazing story.
So check out the book or just a,
you can,

905
00:54:37.111 --> 00:54:41.130
you can Google Ode to aggression and take a look at Dan Gable.
I think,
uh,

906
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:45.900
it will,
it will really leave an indelible mark on your thinking because,
uh,

907
00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:48.960
with this guy has been able to do as a coach and a teacher,

908
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:51.840
a impresses me more than what he did as an athlete.

909
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:56.250
And what he did as an athlete at the time was basically unprecedented.
Uh,

910
00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:00.990
so that's that.
And then the,
the big news,
the biggest news for me,

911
00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:05.550
which involves you,
uh,
is,
uh,

912
00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.340
when people are watching this at by this time,

913
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:12.060
they should be able to go to iTunes and get the entire season of the Tim Ferriss

914
00:55:12.061 --> 00:55:13.410
experiment,
the TV show.

915
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:18.890
And this has been something I fought for for so long and if I did a lawyer up

916
00:55:20.281 --> 00:55:23.970
and negotiate for a year to get the rights back,
no one has seen 11,

917
00:55:23.971 --> 00:55:28.020
I think of the,
of the 13 episodes and most people haven't seen any,
uh,

918
00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.620
done with the team that filmed and edited all of Anthony Bordain stuff.

919
00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:34.080
Super Gritty,
super cinematic.
Um,

920
00:55:34.081 --> 00:55:38.010
we were in the three gun shooting episode together and uh,

921
00:55:38.130 --> 00:55:41.080
it was just an amazing experience.
So I finally have that.

922
00:55:41.081 --> 00:55:43.650
I've hours of bonus footage.
I'm also going to make that available.

923
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:48.780
And so you can see,
uh,
me basically pushing myself to the breaking point.

924
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:52.560
And you do see a lot of injuries and some of these episodes for park core,

925
00:55:52.561 --> 00:55:57.250
professional poker,
Rally Car Racing,
surfing,
Brazilian Jujitsu,

926
00:55:57.251 --> 00:55:58.780
and you want to see like ribs get broken.

927
00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.020
You can check that one with Marcello Garcia,

928
00:56:01.021 --> 00:56:05.070
who's like the Michael Jordan of the sport and all of them are available.

929
00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.240
So you can get it for like,
I dunno,

930
00:56:06.241 --> 00:56:09.870
40 or 50% off if you buy the whole season on iTunes.

931
00:56:09.930 --> 00:56:13.380
So if you go to itunes.com forward slash Tim Ferriss with two r's and two s's,

932
00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:14.101
uh,

933
00:56:14.101 --> 00:56:18.030
or if you just got a four hour workweek.com forward slash TV which is going to

934
00:56:18.031 --> 00:56:20.090
be,
I think it's going to be,
it's going to be cheap.

935
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:24.130
Can Be like 1499 something like that for 13 episodes.
Awesome.
It's really

936
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.530
<v 1>cheap.
So I'm excited.
I still haven't seen our episode.</v>

937
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:30.260
I know that you have it now.
I got to see it.
I've been I every time,

938
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:30.971
well I should say everything,

939
00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:34.000
but I've seen you hell times and I've always brought the hard drive and you make

940
00:56:34.001 --> 00:56:34.691
fun of me because you're like,

941
00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:38.050
who walks around with a hard drive in this day and age?

942
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:40.150
And I'll tell you he's saying

943
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.730
their bitcoin information because they don't want to have it in the cloud.

944
00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:51.130
This isn't bitcoin.
This is like an episode of your freaking.
But my big,

945
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.170
my big card,
the,
these episodes,

946
00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:00.040
the TV show and also not getting sued by Turner Broadcasting for putting stuff

947
00:57:00.041 --> 00:57:03.150
out that isn't or restricted,
which my rights,
uh,

948
00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:07.990
requiring me to do is worth more to me than my bitcoin.

949
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:10.480
So it makes sense that I would take similar perception.

950
00:57:10.481 --> 00:57:12.970
This is what I said to Tim when he got here and he's like,
I have my hard drive.

951
00:57:12.971 --> 00:57:15.400
I'm like,
let me get a copy of that.
And he's like,
no,
I can't give you a copy.

952
00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:16.450
I'm like,

953
00:57:16.450 --> 00:57:20.290
how can you not give me a copy in my hard drive is encrypted the odds that

954
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:24.280
someone hacks into my laptop and then,
well,
maybe not after this episode.

955
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:29.670
And then downloads a four gigabyte files that had,

956
00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.570
it was like 10 gigs.

957
00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:36.100
This is download this random video and then puts it online where you get in

958
00:57:36.101 --> 00:57:37.180
trouble.
It's like,

959
00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:41.250
it's like one in the bazillion and you still won't do it.

960
00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:46.000
One in a bazillion.
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
I mean you could say also,

961
00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.830
all right,
well,
you know,
it's,
it's,
it's like,

962
00:57:50.831 --> 00:57:55.600
so the risk reward multiplied by the probability I get,
I'd get it.
He's the,

963
00:57:55.870 --> 00:58:00.670
you've always been a little paranoid.
That's fine.
I've fall.
Yeah,
little paranoid.

964
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:01.750
Just sort of an understatement.

965
00:58:01.751 --> 00:58:05.170
But it's just trying to be nice and I appreciate that.
So check out the show,

966
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.080
Tim Ferriss experiment.
It's a super proud of it.

967
00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:10.240
I literally almost killed myself doing it.

968
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.760
And if you liked any of this stuff in the books,
you know,

969
00:58:12.761 --> 00:58:14.440
the four hour workweek for our body,
for our chef,

970
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:19.360
all of my favorite concepts and most powerful and flexible principles are in the

971
00:58:19.361 --> 00:58:22.460
show.
We had a lot of fun shooting in our episode.
You should check out the,

972
00:58:22.461 --> 00:58:26.500
the gun shoot.
It was a pretty intense competition.
It was fun.

973
00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:27.791
Really close.

974
00:58:27.791 --> 00:58:32.410
I don't want to spoil it for people that like it was a re pretty much.

975
00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.861
Yeah.

976
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:36.520
Now close to like we were in the competition and how fast we could run through

977
00:58:36.521 --> 00:58:40.180
the course.
We need to switch to the three different guns,
handgun,

978
00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:44.770
shotgun and an ar 15 and so you were,
I mean very,

979
00:58:44.771 --> 00:58:48.310
very and we both got a lot better.
Yeah.
Which is crazy.

980
00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:50.170
So you can check it out.

981
00:58:50.171 --> 00:58:53.320
That's what the sort of savant of the sport and in Taran Butler,
who's,

982
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.640
that guy is shocking to me,

983
00:58:54.641 --> 00:58:59.460
loadings and saying even that is these off the hip shooting.
He isn't,

984
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.890
he's like off the hip and going to hit any target.
He's basically,
it's insane.

985
00:59:02.891 --> 00:59:06.040
You know,
Amy,
I hadn't gunning prodigy.
He can run through the course,

986
00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:11.070
get groupings like this from one to target from the hip while running a like to

987
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:14.830
it faster than that.
It's like you watch him,

988
00:59:14.831 --> 00:59:18.520
you'll see in the episode z feature in there as well,
I'm sure.
Right.
Well,
I mean,

989
00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:21.980
I know he was instructing as all Yang and running.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
And

990
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:22.671
<v 2>you can say,
yeah,</v>

991
00:59:22.671 --> 00:59:26.970
you remember when we did el Presidente Day when there's like a drill where you,

992
00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:31.130
you have to spin around draw,
I guess it's double tap,
double tap,
double tap,

993
00:59:31.310 --> 00:59:36.230
drop the MAG reload,
double tap,
double tap,
double tap and turn.
Did it to

994
00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:41.630
like 1.5,
seven seconds.
It was something I remember both of us were just like,

995
00:59:42.010 --> 00:59:45.680
what?
What is so crazy?

996
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:48.620
I wouldn't have even believed it was the weirdest thing is a big dude.

997
00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.700
Like the big day.
Yeah.
He's not a little barrel ballerina.
I mean,

998
00:59:51.701 --> 00:59:55.130
this is a solid guy and kill us.
So easy.
Yeah,

999
00:59:55.131 --> 00:59:57.440
you can clear the entire time I was there,
I was like,

1000
00:59:57.470 --> 01:00:00.620
this guy could just turn around and kill us and we have no,
we couldn't even run.

1001
01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:05.420
You just make pop up on the debt.
Well,
you know what was funny,
I remember when,

1002
01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:08.150
uh,
when we were prepping the episode and I was like,
yeah,
you know,

1003
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:10.940
I have a block 34.
And,
uh,

1004
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:15.740
I wanted to become more comfortable with the guns I already owned and the Glock

1005
01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:19.260
34 at some point I'd like to use for competition.
So,
uh,

1006
01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.360
like EPA or something like that,
the International Defensive Pistol Association,

1007
01:00:23.361 --> 01:00:27.380
something like that.
In any case,
uh,
so I was talking to,

1008
01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.180
he's talking to Taryn beforehand and I was like,
Hey,

1009
01:00:31.181 --> 01:00:33.520
is there any chance that you have any glocks that I can use any?

1010
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:35.290
Because I have 40 glocks.

1011
01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:41.690
Of course you have 40 glocks.
Yeah.
Uh,
but yeah,
exactly.
And he customizes these.

1012
01:00:41.691 --> 01:00:44.950
So now this is the last guy's house you'd ever want to break.
Oh my God.
Cute.

1013
01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.250
Imagine I was new.
He could take out 40 people.
Oh,

1014
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.870
I guarantee you if like we all raided his house and like all our friends,

1015
01:00:50.871 --> 01:00:55.090
we would all die.
Oh yeah.
Without a doubt.
Without a doubt.
Let's see.

1016
01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:58.100
When you watch the episode,
he's incredible.
So anyway,

1017
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:02.990
for each of the episodes we have some crazy superhuman type of teacher like

1018
01:01:02.991 --> 01:01:05.230
that.
For surfing it was Laird Hamilton,
you know,

1019
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:09.410
the undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing and on and on and on.
So check it out.

1020
01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.450
A four hour workweek.com forward slash TV.
Sweet.
I think that's it.

1021
01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:17.510
Suck them all off.
What did,
what did Graham have to say?

1022
01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.780
There was something you we were talking about before we started the episode that

1023
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:23.450
I thought was interesting.
You had one thing to say.
You're like,
oh blah,

1024
01:01:23.451 --> 01:01:24.970
blah blah.
And I was like,
oh,
that's really interesting.
Grabbed me.

1025
01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.850
She talk about on the show the fact that everyone in this room is wearing v neck

1026
01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:32.540
gray shirts.
No,
it wasn't greening something else.

1027
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.450
Some point he had to make.
Oh Wow.
It's over.
Grandkids is it?

1028
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:37.101
And you can have like,

1029
01:01:37.101 --> 01:01:40.340
you can laugh at like a 10 minute talk at the camera after it's [inaudible].

1030
01:01:40.410 --> 01:01:43.700
It's like Graham Graham show.
You should do that sometimes.

1031
01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:47.090
We don't ever watch the entire episode.
Sexy time.

1032
01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:50.720
We can splice in Alissa.
Shots of Graham like fight club.

1033
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.960
Just you should splice in like a shot of you in the bathtub with like candles

1034
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:57.170
around.
It's like Graham's little private hour.
All right,
we're gonna sorry.

1035
01:01:57.260 --> 01:02:01.910
I think that's about it.
Anything else?
That's it.
Uh,
yeah,
we'll see what was good.

1036
01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.830
I'm heading to,
uh,
to New York for a week and then I'm back.

1037
01:02:05.110 --> 01:02:07.560
I don't know where to shoot again,
but we'll figure it out.
Okay.
Not The people.

1038
01:02:07.561 --> 01:02:10.400
That's why it's the random show.
I'm glad any other confessions.

1039
01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:14.510
Now I'm logistics updates.
All right guys,

1040
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:19.643
Ferris

1041
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.710
<v 0>bestselling author and Human Guinea pig.</v>

1042
01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:26.670
I'll show you how to make the impossible possible by bending the rules.

1043
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:32.730
I'll find the world's best teachers and push myself to the edge to deconstruct,

1044
01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:33.903
decode,

1045
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:38.280
and demystify some of the world's toughest challenges in record time

1046
01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:45.570
if I can do it.
So can you,

1047
01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.640
one of the best ways to learn something fast as to set stakes.

1048
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:53.790
Everybody that wants you to give it up for Mister Tim Ferriss over there now.

1049
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.150
So here it goes.
Hey,

1050
01:02:56.151 --> 01:03:00.660
you could feel the power rising up in your loins five days.

1051
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.890
This is like the first time I looked at Chinese characters.
Zero experience,

1052
01:03:05.010 --> 01:03:08.010
you're in,
you're in trouble.
Okay.
And the world's best teachers

1053
01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:13.500
is four or five days were really enough time.
I have my doubts.

1054
01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.080
Sometimes accelerated learning requires serious acceleration.

1055
01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.040
The course is designed to kill you,

1056
01:03:23.850 --> 01:03:28.850
so here it goes and 50% excited and 50% totally scared shitless.

1057
01:03:29.910 --> 01:03:34.350
Five days you've got a fitbit.
Sure.
Accelerator F zero experience,

1058
01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.030
but I'm terrified of it,
but I did not.

1059
01:03:36.031 --> 01:03:38.430
Clay would be a good driver and the world's best teachers.

1060
01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.520
One mistake and you and your car are toast.

1061
01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:47.970
Stand by camera three.

1062
01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:53.220
I've never been to the Philippines.
Sally's speak.
One word of Tagalo in that is,

1063
01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:54.680
thank you Stella.

1064
01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:58.860
All you're telling me we speak like a Filipino now with language learning

1065
01:03:58.861 --> 01:04:00.090
experts on my side.

1066
01:04:00.091 --> 01:04:05.091
I will find out just how much Tagalog I can cram in four days and this is the

1067
01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:10.080
day of reckoning for Tim.
Are you ready
this week?

1068
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.520
I'm throwing down.

1069
01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:16.890
You're rushing past to step.

1070
01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.970
I've got to learn fast and it's not going to be tricky.

1071
01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:23.900
Five days to train.
I am getting a little deep

1072
01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:30.390
and the world's best teachers at least nice adjustment.
What comes out.

1073
01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:32.550
All right,
you ready?
Let's go.

1074
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.340
You ready for this?
Ready is a little name this week.

1075
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.380
I'll attempt to prove that man can fly

1076
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:48.120
the trees,
rings that fear into it.
Five days.

1077
01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.740
Zero experience.
The danger of permanent damage.

1078
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.980
He's a rope insurance and the world's best teacher.

1079
01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:00.720
The end goal is to move into real world environments.

1080
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:08.640
Total golf through what?
A three wood,
five days.

1081
01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:12.270
Zero experience and the world's best teachers.

1082
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:21.730
We need to clear the mind.
Yeah.
Avoid catastrophes.
Take a chill pill.

1083
01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:26.560
I don't
feel like I need to pass punch.

1084
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.400
Accelerated learning can be applied to anything.

1085
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:33.300
They broken down the art of attraction to an exact sites.
Really anything.

1086
01:05:34.770 --> 01:05:39.120
Having an animal,
it's like crack.
Five days.
I stutter,
I stammer.

1087
01:05:39.121 --> 01:05:40.230
My hands are sweating.

1088
01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:46.400
Millions efficiency back in ninth grade and the world's best teachers,

1089
01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:51.360
eh?
I'm sure you married by Saturday this week.

1090
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:54.390
I'm using my startup experience to help a novice entrepreneur.

1091
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:57.223
I'm a little scared.

1092
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.700
I've just four days to set her on a new path and hopefully give her the tools to

1093
01:06:02.701 --> 01:06:03.870
unlock her full potential.

1094
01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:11.960
This week it's trial by fire.
Weapon is hot,
range is hot.
I have to learn fast.

1095
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:13.670
One 63 your fastest draw.

1096
01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:18.590
These are going about 1280% it's not going to be easy and he misses

1097
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:26.420
four days to train in the world's best teachers here to ready.
Standby.

1098
01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.110
When I say if I can do it,
so can you.

1099
01:06:30.170 --> 01:06:35.170
I mean it very literally this week up through the learning curve as alternate a

1100
01:06:36.741 --> 01:06:38.780
novice swimmer into a long distance swimming.

1101
01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:41.060
Every time I look at the ways and the open water,

1102
01:06:41.061 --> 01:06:44.090
I get really nervous with help from the master who taught me.

1103
01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:47.180
I know these steps where in just five days,

1104
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:50.330
Sarah is struggling.

1105
01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:00.140
Sometimes to learn fast,
you have to slow way down.

1106
01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.270
The only thing that there is is that now,

1107
01:07:02.300 --> 01:07:06.110
maybe that's the most honest way to be four days,

1108
01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:08.240
one badass legend.

1109
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:13.130
You think you haven't paddle again and some seriously unpredictable terrain.

1110
01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:17.450
Turn at Callaway.
Yotam.
Here we go.

1111
01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:23.060
This week I'm going all in.

1112
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:27.150
Nothing gets me learning faster than putting money on the line.

1113
01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.000
Hi and a nervous wreck.

1114
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:35.300
I've never played a hand in making me look very foolish here

1115
01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.780
Liz is when my head explodes.

1116
01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.470
If you think there's nothing you can do when disaster strikes,

1117
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.380
I think again,

1118
01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.990
in just four days,
I'll build a toolkit for survival,

1119
01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:01.800
my end game to be ready for anything.
Oh,

1120
01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.820
