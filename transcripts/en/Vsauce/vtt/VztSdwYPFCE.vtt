Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Steve Seitz

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.250
and Chuck Dyer used view morphing to 
digitally reveal a side of the Mona Lisa

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.660
we've never seen before.
What it would look like if she stared

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.740
directly at us. That's her but it seems a bit

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.130
unfamiliar. I mean, there is only one iconic

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.199
view of the Mona Lisa. There's only one
physical object you can look at

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.400
to say that you saw the Mona Lisa with
your own eyes.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.100
Photographs exist.
There are copies you can also look at.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.160
There are forgeries,
there are parodies but the true

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.969
original Mona Lisa is in the Louvre.
That's where it is.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.429
But where is this video?

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.540
Seriously,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.570
where is this video?

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.629
I mean, it's on your screen right now but it's
also on a lot of

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.680
other screens. Where's the original? Well,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.949
it's stored on YouTube servers and the
original export is on my hard drive

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.039
but those are just instructions for making

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.439
the video. This video is anywhere.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.909
Every stream, every viewing of this video
is, as Bill Thompson would say,

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.669
"a digital simulacrum of something that
has no original".

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.540
So, how does a museum curator 
or an archaeologist deal with this?

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.570
Well, they are rethinking curating.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.670
I mean, take a look at this sculpture.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.850
"The distance from this sentence to your eye

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.340
is my sculpture." That's pretty cool, but

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.100
how do you put something like that in a
museum? This sculpture and this video can be

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.479
endlessly copied and every version is
made out of different

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.979
stuff at different times, a bit like

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.110
your body. There's an identity crisis
going on. As I discussed before,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.890
every few years nearly all of your atoms are replaced.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.710
Old ones leave, new ones come in.
Where is the original

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.240
you?

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.319
Like this video, you are really just the
result of a set of instructions being

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.170
followed. And in our cases, interestingly, 
those instructions

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.730
are kind of forgeries. 'The $12 Million Stuffed Shark'

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.599
is a great book about the art world. It
mentions that, at one point in history,

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.390
there were 600 Rembrandt's hanging in
museums

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.770
and 350 Rembrandt's in private
collections.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.900
The only problem is Rembrandt scholars
say that Rembrandt only ever made

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.280
320 paintings. Mistaken identity,

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.349
forgeries and phonies have been around for a long time.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.030
In 1496 a young Michelangelo, the same
Michelangelo that painted

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.300
this, forged a statue. He treated the
statue with acid to make it look

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.280
not like his own work but like the work
of ancient Greeks or Romans,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.280
so he could sell it for more money.
But really, what's wrong with a forgery?

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.459
I mean, sure, supporting forgeries is
like supporting plagiarism but as far as

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.830
intrinsic aesthetic properties go, what's the difference?

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.180
Whether painted by Da Vinci, or a dog, or
copied perfectly by a robot,

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.349
wouldn't the Mona Lisa smile just as mysteriously

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.659
and cooly? Well, here's the thing.

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.120
We feel like the original, the Mona Lisa
Da Vinci originally made, has

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.860
an aura about it. As Richard Wiseman discussed

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.750
in Quirkology - a great book - psychologist
Paul Rosen once studied just how obsessed

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.260
we are with relics,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.440
things important merely because of their
auras. He found that people were more

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.340
willing to wear a sweater

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.569
that had been dropped in dog poop than
they were to wear a sweater they had been told

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.390
what was once

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.650
owned by a mass murderer.
We are influenced by auras.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.129
Right now, I am in Mougin. The city in
southeastern France where Picasso

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.689
died. On one occasion Picasso refused to
sign a painting

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.370
he knew he had painted, saying "I can paint a fake Picasso just like anybody else."

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.480
You can disown your own paintings

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.620
and you can disown your children but
you can claim to have created your own paintings,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.639
but can you really claim to have created

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.719
your own children?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.960
Let's explore a metaphor.
Your mother is a 3D printer that printed you.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.340
But hold on, your parents conceived you

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.860
and curated you, cared for you.
But the actual blueprints that made you

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.270
were outside of their conscious control.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.449
Your blueprint is a forgery.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.680
It has been copied, replicated, over and
over again, ever since the very first

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.270
group of molecules were arranged in a
way that automatically replicated

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.000
billions and billions of years ago.
It's not a perfect forgery.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.639
Changes occur every time, making
successive copies a little bit different.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.650
But 99.9 percent of your DNA

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.060
isn't different from anyone else's.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.740
Now, you might say, but wait, Michael,
we all look so different.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.770
Kind of. But that's also because your brain

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.220
is particularly good at recognizing
differences amongst things that you are

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.259
familiar with.

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.550
It's called the cross-race effect and it's the reason

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.120
new twins you've never met before look
totally the same, until you get used to them.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.930
It's the reason people from a culture
you're not use to tend to be

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.960
more difficult to distinguish. And the
reason, say, a big group of black labs

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
you've never met before

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.990
all kind of look like the same black lab.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.789
We all have a common descendant, a common
person our DNA has been replicated from

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:42.240
over and over again,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.560
making us, in a funny way, a big bunch of forgeries.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.910
Go back 50 forgeries ago, 50

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.479
generations ago, and that's enough to
connect every single human living on Earth.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.229
I've said this before, you are at least 50th cousins

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:02.500
with everyone else living on the planet
today. But we can go back further than that,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.900
as Guy Murchie famously did. You see,
animal populations, and even

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.110
molecule populations, experience replication

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.430
variation and selective pressures, which means

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.160
you are trillionth cousins with all life on

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.400
Earth and, technically speaking, quadrillionth

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.490
cousins with water and trees and rocks.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.120
It's a beautiful notion but it's anything but new.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.400
The word 'human' comes from a word for soil.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.540
And compare the Hebrew word for 'ground'
with their name for the first man.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.350
You are quadrillionth cousins with dirt,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.039
with rocks, with trees, with plastic, with
the very clothing you are wearing

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.090
right now. So whether you're fighting
with a stranger in a bar

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.569
or stubbing your toe on a rock, it's all

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:55.969
just a family squabble.

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:57.410
And as always,

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:59.270
thanks for watching.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.960
Oh, hey, you're still there.
This is great because I have some

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.870
