Bake two pies at the same time and then
relax on

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.399
pancake pillows.
It's episode 18

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:07.399
of LÜT.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.549
You can also choose to use emoticon
pillows or a True Blood necklace.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.000
If you're a neat freak, protect your tables
with Portal 2 warning sign coasters.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.289
And then store your photos on an SD card,

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.199
or in a SD card photo album.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.099
Personally, I just stick one cool pic on my
laptop lid to make it look see-through

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:33.500
or to make myself look X-rayed or bikini-clad.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.210
And these spatulas will make your cooking more super

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.469
hero. Deal yourself hand of nostalgia
with these space invader playing cards

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.280
and graduate from Bucky Balls too Bucky

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.680
Cubes, a bunch of cube magnets only
outdone by the book

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.430
HTML for babies. Teach your child letters
and colours while also reminding them

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.280
of proper HTML mark-up.
Vat19's H2O candle kit lets you create

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.219
a flame

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.439
that appears to sit right on top of water,
which is the best kind of light to play

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.180
by when messing around with you Fisher
Price classic toy

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.650
keychains.
Thrown on a steampunk skeleton t-shirt

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.689
and escape the stress of smartphones 
with John's phone.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.689
It accepts a SIM card, but all it can do

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.960
is call people and receive calls.
Due to its simplicity

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.759
its call time lasts six hours and when
it's not in use its battery lasts

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.259
3 weeks.
I met PureKatherine

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.710
in Chicago last month.
Now, she will cover your shoes or

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.579
anything else you'd like in glitter,
a perfectly trade secret protected coat of

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.200
glitter that doesn't shed

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.000
off.
These Batman clothespins also keep things secure

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.070
and this skateboard bench is great for
your bedroom.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.149
Here's a robot you can control with an app
on your phone.

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.390
Oh look, cats love it.
But if you cat loves scratching,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.860
let him be a DJ and scratch on a
scratching post turntable.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.930
But if your cat dies, that's okay, because
the airport in Amsterdam have trash cans

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.479
for your used pets.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.610
Just kidding. PET means polyethylene
terephthalate, a polymer used in liquid

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.780
containers.
But, if you're hungry,

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.190
check out Exotic Meat Market.
This service sells

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.459
legal meat for you to cook and eat.
Raccoon meat,

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.430
llama, bacon made from a black bear, crocodile,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.510
kangaroo and even lion meat.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.190
That's right. For $100 you
can buy three burgers

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.980
made out of lion meat.
Lions are not endangered

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.590
and these burgers are made from lions
raised in Illinois.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.580
The only part that's a little bit weird is
that when you eat lion

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.550
you're eating cat.
Okay, now it's time for the free thing.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.780
I'm gonna let you guys in on a little bit of a Vsauce

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.959
secret. FakeNameGenerator.com.

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.780
This website will give you a person's
name, it'll make up their address, it'll

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.170
make up all kinds of data about them every
time you refresh the page,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.690
but what's fun is that it also generates a
pronounceable,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.790
available ".com" domain name.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.659
And it's this service, by sitting there
and pressing refresh over and over again

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.870
that

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.300
I used to find Vsauce.com.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.580
I said that's the perfect name and hence

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.620
here we are today.
Thank you FakeNameGenerator.com

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.500
for giving us Vsauce.
And to all of you out there:

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.420
As always,

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.840
thank you for watching.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.620
Vsauce, welcome to my hotel room.
As you can see, episode 18 of LÜT is back

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.010
up. I'm not really sure what happened to it,
I think it may have been the

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.599
international police.
They've been after me all weekend

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.790
for stealing the hearts of women

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.420
all over Madrid. Seriously, I've got like
a dozen of 'em in this bag stuck in the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.840
mini fridge, it's really gross,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.629
but that shouldn't get in the way of
a bonus item I think that I just found last

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:57.080
night.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.409
A terra cotta pot.
Just kidding. It's also a grill

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.080
and the grilling surfaces circles mean
that the grill marks on your food

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.080
are polka dots.
Pretty fun, right?
