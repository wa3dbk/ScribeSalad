00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.430
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here.

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.029
This picture is

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.700
about a year and a half old.
But the pyramids themselves

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.530
are much older than that.
How much older? Well, think of it this way.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.570
The Pyramids of Giza were as

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.520
old to the ancient Romans as the ancient Romans

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.350
are to us.
When the pyramids were being built

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.990
there were woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.570
That's pretty old.
But don't get too impressed.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.090
We often learn about the past in units, separate

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.899
chapters, which distracts from the fact
that many chapters aren't

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.309
just nearer each other than you might think,
they are often

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.590
literally written on top of one another.
Anne Frank

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.910
and Martin Luther King Jr. were born
in the exact same year.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.610
By the late 1960s humans had come a long way.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.920
We've become a spacefaring species.
But while we were sending

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.710
the first probes to the Moon and Venus and Mars,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.810
it was still illegal for a black person
and a white person to marry

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.049
in 16 states.
The guillotine

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.650
seems like a macabre artefact from bygone days

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.180
but it was last used by France to
officially behead a criminal

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.610
the year Star Wars came out.
While General Custer was fighting

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.470
native tribes on the American frontier,
the Brooklyn Bridge

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.950
was being build.
And there were people alive then

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.150
who would later watch the Moon landing on television.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.310
We went from Custer's last stand to

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.490
Armstrong's first steps within the span

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.730
of a single human life.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.500
But all of these stories,
from the pyramids to Julius Caesar to

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.460
you watching this video right now,
belong to an incredibly thin section

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.460
in the book

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.799
of human history.
Compared to what human life has

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.040
mainly been like here on earth, our current societies

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.660
are weird.
Weird is also an acronym used

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.580
by Jared Diamond in his new book
"The World Until Yesterday."

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.180
Jared Diamond wrote
"Guns, Germs, and Steel," "Collapse"

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290
and he's here with me to talk about weird.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.819
Weird, w-e-i-r-d,

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.310
is an acronym for "western, educated,
industrial, rich and democratic."

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.940
When we talk about human nature
we're really talking about

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.550
a narrow slice of society.
Traditional societies were

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.450
everybody in the world,
from the beginning of human evolution

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.650
6 million years ago until within the last

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.069
10,000 years for the first time we began
encountering strangers and then we

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.680
developed

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.239
writing and then we acquired kings.
All of these things that we take for granted

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.940
are matter of the last 5,000 - 10,000 years.
Or the Internet

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.620
or the media, they're a matter
of the last few decades.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.590
The relative recency of weird societies
in the speed with which

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.110
information and knowledge increases
means that not that long ago

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.780
we thought some pretty strange things.
For instance,

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.000
in 1903 The New York Times predicted
that building a flying machine

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.110
would be possible in 1 to 10 million years.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.140
Later that very same year
the Wright brothers flew at Kitty Hawk.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.840
In 1908 it was said that no flying machine will

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.159
ever fly from New York to Paris.
Who made that 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:39.959
foolish prediction?
One of the Wright brothers.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.750
In 1962 the Decca recording company

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.370
passed on a young rock band, saying
"we don't like their sound

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.599
and guitar music is on the way out."
The band in question

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:58.180
was the Beatles. Keith Moon 
and John Entwistle were said to have remarked

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.689
about a band called The New Yardbirds,

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.010
"that band so ill-conceived it will sink

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.580
like a balloon or a zeppelin made out of lead."

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.460
Well, Jimmy Page was not deterred.
In fact, he took that phrase

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.750
and made it his band's new name.
He removed the A, so it wouldn't be pronounced

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.519
"lead," and that's where we got Led Zeppelin.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.990
There is evidence the Nazis weren't entirely convinced

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.350
Earth was a globe we lived on the outside of.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.990
Instead, they figured the Earth's
continents were actually aligning

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.530
on the inside of a hollow concave surface
with the stars and moon and planets

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.840
in the middle. Seriously.

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.900
As the story goes, Doctor Heinz Fischer
was sent to Rügen Island

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.530
to spy on the British.
Now, the curvature of the earth would have made this

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.650
impossible.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.240
But thinking the earth was shaped like
this, they pointed their telescopes

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.440
up at a 45 degree angle. Needless to say,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.020
the experiment didn't work.
The Eiffel Tower's

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.949
inauguration and the Wall Street Journal
and "Starry Night"

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.039
and Coca-Cola and Nintendo and Adolf Hitler

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.389
all began in 1889.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.700
As did a guy named Thomas Midgley Jr.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.740
Celebrated in his time,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.120
Midgley's legacy has since been tarnished by

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.180
the negative consequences of his inventions.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.840
His list of contributions to society is

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.729
impressively disastrous.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.009
In the late twenties, Midgley synthesized
the first chloro-fluorocarbons -

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.789
CFC - for which he won
the Society of Chemical Industry's

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:45.560
Perkin medal.
Only later did we realize

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.229
all of those tons of CFCs we were emitting

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:54.009
were eating away 4% of our
atmosphere's protective ozone layer

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:57.669
every decade. Like a virus, creating a

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.569
wound, unlikely to completely heal until me and you

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.639
have long been dead. In the early 1920s

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.190
Midgley discovered that by adding Tetraethyllead

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.940
to gasoline engine knocking could be reduced.

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.780
The American Chemical Society gave him
the 1923 Nichols' medal

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:22.199
for the discovery. There were other, safer
alternatives but General Motors jointly

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.830
owned a patent on Tetraethyllead

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.030
with Midgley.
They could make a profit on it, so they advertised it as

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.080
the best option and almost immediately nearly

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.660
every motor vehicle on earth was spewing

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.699
lead into our atmosphere

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.460
and soil, which put it in our blood,

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.430
lead poisoning for decades.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.430
Currently, the reference for healthy children is a blood

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.630
lead content of less than 5 micrograms

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.580
per decilitre. After the popularization of Midgley's

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:00.410
leaded gasoline, 88% of children

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.210
in America had double that amount of lead in their

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.460
blood.
When leaded gasoline was finally phased out

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.569
in the 1970s, that percentage fell

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:14.639
to 9%. Lead is a neuro toxin.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.440
Even light exposure,
like that caused by Midgley's invention,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.699
can cause a decrease in intelligence and in increase

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:25.360
in anti-social behaviour.
Fordham University found that

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.120
in young adults the best predictor of delinquent

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.639
and violent behavior is literally the lead content

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.750
of their blood.
Chillingly, the rise and fall

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:41.560
of violent crimes by juveniles in the 20th century

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.900
tracks significantly closely with the
rise and fall of lead

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.210
in their blood when they were
preschoolers - all over the world.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.460
Historian J. R. McNeill remarked that Midgley

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.120
had more impact on the atmosphere
than any other single

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.699
organism in Earth's history.
Midgley's

00:08:00.699 --> 00:08:04.210
final invention was even worse.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.970
Well, for him. In 1940 he contracted

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.639
polio.
To help his friends and family lift him from bed

00:08:11.639 --> 00:08:15.780
he designed an intricate system of ropes and pulleys.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:19.389
As was the story of his life, the invention seemed

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:22.580
brilliant at first, but four years later he became

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.789
accidentally entangled in the ropes
and his own invention

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:29.879
strangled him to death.

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:33.940
Midgley's life took up 0.55%

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:37.349
of human history.
And, roughly speaking, yours will too.

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:41.289
To put that in perspective, let's time travel,

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:44.560
starting right now.
We begin

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.670
100,000 years ago - the beginning of modern humans.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.830
We are moving forward in time an entire millennia,

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:56.330
a thousand years, every second.
As you can see,

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.910
not much is changing.
Our modern world

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:04.550
will briefly flash at the end.
That's all it is. That's all it's been.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.930
So be careful not to miss it.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:08.090
And as always,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:09.410
thanks for watching.
