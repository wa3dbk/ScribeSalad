00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.050
Hey, Vsauce Michael here, and today,

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.710
in honor of Leap Day, I would like to
talk about leaps.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.430
What's the largest leap a living
thing could possibly take?

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.440
And how does the fact that life can leap

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.570
possibly give us evidence that you, me, and all of us

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.900
are actually aliens?

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:24.610
Well, in 1903, the Wright Brothers

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.700
became the first humans to fly

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.950
in an airplane, and then a mere 66 years later,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.330
we were already landing on the moon.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.330
Neil Armstrong's giant leap for mankind

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.960
may have been a small step for him,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.420
but let's put these two events in perspective.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.430
The Wright Brother's original flight was so brief

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.340
and low, it could've completely occurred

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.930
inside the external tank of the space shuttle.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.270
What I'm getting at here is that going from the very first airplane

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.890
to us landing on the moon only took 66 years.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.610
But to get from the invention of the motorcycle

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.530
to the very first successful backflip on a motorcycle

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.740
didn't take 66 years.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.120
No, it took nearly 120.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.790
The first successful backflip done on a full sized motorcycle

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.540
didn't happen until the year 2000,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.590
and it was accomplished by Kerry Hart.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.510
Now, since then, double backflips and even
triple backflips have been done on motorcycles.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.760
But according to calculations done by
extreme sport physics,

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.890
no matter how much better riders get,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.010
with the current power motorcycles have,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.810
you will never be able to do any more than
four back flips in one jump.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.110
Extreme sports in general are excellent
for demonstrating physics—

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.570
for instance, your center of mass.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.030
Your center of mass is a point in space

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.450
where your mass is concentrated.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.420
It's where your weight as caused by gravity acts from.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.870
Now, humans have a surprisingly high
center of gravity,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.630
which makes it possible for
magicians to do tricks like this one.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.680
The concept of a center of mass

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.850
also explains why a skateboarder can
increase his or her speed

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.180
on an incline just by changing how
tall they're standing.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.180
It's also the reason you can pump your legs

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.770
to swing higher in a swing.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.480
What you accomplish by pumping your legs on a swing

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.780
is an elevation of your center of mass above

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.320
where your body actually is.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.490
Now, because gravity acts at that point,

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.200
you're going to swing back down as if you were

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.950
higher up than you actually were.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.330
So you gain more and more acceleration each time.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.590
Geometrically speaking,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.210
the center of the lower 48 states

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.920
is near Lebanon, Kansas.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.430
But this is where things get heartwarming.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.920
If you were to cut out the lower 48 states

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.720
and then take that shape and figure out how to balance

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.890
it perfectly, you would find that the center of mass

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.320
for the United States is a town in Nebraska called Friend.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.650
Back to leaps, here's a question you may have asked yourself

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.950
while watching certain movies, could a snow boarder

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.910
escape an oncoming avalanche?

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.860
Well, in 2007, Popular Science Magazine said no.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.210
But technically, you could.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.460
Extreme sports physics points out that
Galileo showed that when friction and drag are low,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.670
gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.210
So while it's possible, it wouldn't
necessarily be safe.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.510
But when are extreme sports ever safe?

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.520
If you want to get really unsafe,
let's go back to Joseph Kittinger.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.980
I've covered this guy in lean backs in the past.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.980
He's the guy who back in 1960 as part
of a government experiment

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.950
jumped off of a weather balloon
102,000 feet above earth,

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.450
so high up that you can see the back of space.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.120
But within the next few years,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.200
Red Bull may have something hidden up their sleeve.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.030
It's rumored that Kittinger himself
may be advising an upcoming project

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.040
with Felix Bongardner where Felix will dive

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.670
not from 102,000 feet up, but 120,000 feet up.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.760
The difference here is that Felix will be jumping to earth

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.970
actually from what we consider space,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.140
and during his fall, he will literally

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.520
break the sound barrier.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.480
His body will travel faster than sound.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.279
He will become the first human
to break the sound barrier

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.489
with their body.

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:35.779
Earth's gravity loves to pull things down towards it.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:41.369
But the gravity we experience here on the
surface is just one gravity,

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:44.369
one g—it's what causes us to weight what we weigh.

00:04:44.369 --> 00:04:48.709
But when we accelerate, we experience more than 1g.

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:52.419
When the world record for the most
air achieved on a snow board occurred,

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.719
the snowboarder himself
experienced four to five g's at the base of the ramp.

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.679
Meaning that momentarily, his legs each
had to support 700 pounds.

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:05.849
To put this in perspective, astronauts aboard

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.979
the space shuttle experience a peak of only 3g's.

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:13.859
More than 5g's experienced for an extended period of time

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:16.239
can easily be lethal.

00:05:16.239 --> 00:05:19.369
Enter the euthanasia coaster.

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:24.499
It's a roller coaster designed
to kill the people who ride it.

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:28.499
The first drop accelerates you to more than
200 miles an hour.

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:35.209
And these loops are built to provide a constant
10 g experience for one full minute.

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:37.669
It's estimated that no human being

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.929
could even survive past the first
two loops. Why?

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:45.019
Because 10 g's exerted that way

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:48.679
would pull blood away from your brain,
starving it of oxygen

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:50.899
resulting in brain death.

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:53.269
And that's just 10 g's.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.989
If you were to ride on a bullet,

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:58.279
you would experience a peak g force

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:00.529
of 190,000.

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.369
That means that your body would weigh
190,000 times more

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:07.619
than it does stationary on earth.

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:09.869
But here's where things get muddy.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.539
Japanese researchers have found bacteria

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:17.339
that not only survive, but thrive in an ultra centerfuge

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:19.929
exerting not 190,000 g's,

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:24.389
but more than 400,000.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.679
The implications here are mind blowing.

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:29.519
We already know that some single celled lifeforms

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.849
can survive in extreme conditions.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.899
Just this morning, I was reading
one of Bill Bryson's books

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:38.949
about how we have actually found dormant,
but viable bacteria

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:41.199
trapped inside cameras

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.619
left for years on the moon.

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:49.249
If simple life forms can also survive
incredible g-forces,

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:54.869
that means that the entire earth was blown
up by an asteroid, life as we know it

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.209
might not be over.

00:06:57.209 --> 00:07:00.299
There may be simple life forms that could

00:07:00.299 --> 00:07:03.339
survive, dormant, traveling through space

00:07:03.339 --> 00:07:06.849
only to land on other planets
billions of years in the future.

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:10.339
In fact, who's to say that a similar process

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:13.189
isn't what brought life here to earth?

00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:16.769
It sounds crazy, but the entire concept has a name:

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.729
Panspermia.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.449
Let's keep things grounded and stick to earth.

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:25.409
Specifically, extreme sports.

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:30.499
I had all these leap thoughts lately because
I've been working with really cool extreme sport channels—

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:36.039
new ones—here on YouTube including Ride with Tony Hawk, Ally Sports, and Network A.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.709
If you like extreme sports, you should definitely

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:42.049
check these out, they've even got special messages
just for you.

00:07:42.049 --> 00:07:45.049
So, have fun, cherish the leap day,

00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:47.219
and as always, thanks for watching.
