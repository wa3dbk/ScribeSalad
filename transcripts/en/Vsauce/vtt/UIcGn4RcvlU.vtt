Hey, Vsauce. It's Michael with two big
announcements.

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.410
Count them two. First of all, there's a brand new
episode of Vsauce Leanback

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.889
that you can start by clicking the link
at the top of this video's description.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.369
This week the topic is crazy and classic
social psychology experiments.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.270
Three years ago I was at the University
of Chicago studying psychology.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.529
I mainly did neuropsychology, but it was the social stuff,

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.789
the social experiments, that really were fun to watch.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.679
So I went head and went through YouTube and put
together some of my favorite taped

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.560
experiments.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.610
A lot of these are actually very very
classic and have been very important to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.050
understanding how we act

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.590
around other people.
Speaking of other people,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.010
we have a brand new "Sauciest of the Week."
Remember that Sauciest of the Week is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.680
given to a member of the community,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.710
a fellow WeSaucer who's done something cool,

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.440
whether it's just a simple awesome
comment, a great recommendation for a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.690
website or a game

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.260
or if they made something or made a video that we think we should all see. Now,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.969
each week the winner is determined by
last week's winner

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.420
and last week the first one was chosen
by myself - I picked sofusser.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.170
Well sofusser got back to me and said that this
week's winner should be roadhousee.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.900
Why? Because of this video he has about goats

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.250
climbing up a steep wall.
Saucy!

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.759
Roadhousee, if you're out there, get
back to me about who you think from the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.900
WeSauce community should win next week

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.520
for doing something awesome or having
something cool you think we should see.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.509
But seriously, what are you waiting for?
Click the link at the top of this video's

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.200
description to start lean back.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.560
If you're on a phone, as you know,
it won't really work yet,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.720
so wait until it's a better time or if you're really impatient,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.060
I did put links to everything I cover in
this video's description.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.460
So, have fun...

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.920
And as always,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.320
thanks for watching.
