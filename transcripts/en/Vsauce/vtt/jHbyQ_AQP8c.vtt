00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.950
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And what if every
single person on Earth jumped at the exact

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.190
same time? Could it cause an earthquake or
would we not even be able to tell?

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.250
Well, first things first,
let's talk about the Earth's rotation.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.500
The Earth spins, that's why we have night
and day, and it spins quickly. At the equator,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.840
the Earth is spinning at more than 1,000 MPH.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.840
Now, a spinning ice skater can speed up by
moving mass closer to the center and the

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.320
Earth is no different. In fact, if you get
down on the ground right now and move your

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.400
mass closer to Earth's center, technically,
you will speed up Earth's rotation, making

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.149
this day shorter.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.069
Now, the change that you would make to the
Earth's rotation is way smaller than we could

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.929
even measure, but it is calculable, and the
impact can be quite impressive when you talk

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.369
about redistributing more mass than just one person.

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:04.320
For instance, last year, the earthquake in
Japan redistributed so much of Earth's mass

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.320
towards the center, that every day since then
has been 1.8 microseconds shorter.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.500
But that was a giant geological event. What
can us humans do to the Earth all on our own?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.050
I mean, there are more than 7 billion of us
now. What if we all got together in one place

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.530
and jumped?

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.050
Well, what would that even look like?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.440
Interestingly, if you took the entire human
population of Earth and had them all live

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.830
in one place with the same density that people
live in in New York City, you could fit everyone -

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.510
all of us - into the state of Texas.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.100
But that's living, not standing around in
a crowd, which is how we would probably want

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.010
to do the jump.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.110
If every single person alive right now on
Earth stood shoulder to shoulder, you could

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.220
fit all of us into the city of Los Angeles.
It would be an incredible sight to behold -

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.880
a mere 500 square miles containing
every single person on Earth.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.380
Ok, so, then we jump. What happens?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.940
Unfortunately, not much. I mean, we're all
awesome people here on Earth, but our collective

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.240
mass compared to the mass of the entire Earth?
It's like nothing.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.219
In fact, Dot Physics calculated that if all
of us were to get together in one location

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:28.909
and all jump 30 cm into the air at the exact
same time, we would push Earth away from us

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.229
a tiny amount.

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:37.869
Earth would only move away from us about 1/100th
of the width of a single Hydrogen Atom. And

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:43.480
here's another thing. Because we're all jumping
and then going back to where we started, Earth

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.719
is just going to move back to where it started.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:52.139
So, our big jump won't be able to change Earth's
position in space, but, c'mon, 7 billion people

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.829
all jumping together? That's gotta be able
to cause some sort of seismic activity, right?

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.900
So let's say you have a lot of people all
together in one place and you have them all

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.640
jump on: 1-2-3!

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Did you feel that? Well, the BBC did this
with 50,000 people and discovered that a

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.529
kilometer and a half away, it only registered
a .6 on the Richter scale. You would need

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:20.590
7 million times more people than even live
on Earth right now to jump at once to recreate

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.760
the earthquake that recently happened in Japan.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.400
So, even though we're all awesome, compared
to the size of the Earth, we're not much.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.480
But don't get too discouraged. Our collective
jump would contain a lot of energy. The Straight

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.080
Dope calculated that even if only the people
who lived in China got together and jumped,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.080
their jump would be the equivalent of 500
tons of TNT. Of course, 500 tons of TNT doesn't

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:52.300
do much to an Earth that weighs
6 sextillion 588 quintillion tons.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.359
To make yourself feel more powerful, pick
a card. I've got 10 of them here, let's say,

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:06.259
hmmm, you choose this one. Boom, congratulations,
we have just decimated this deck of cards.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.900
Why? Well because, technically, decimate does
not mean "obliterate completely."

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.800
Deci=10. It means to take away 1/10th of something.
So, the next time you take a quiz and don't

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:26.680
do so well on it, you only get 10%. Well, sure,
that's an "F", but by getting 10% of them

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.110
right, you DECIMATED that quiz.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.990
And since we've been talking about crowds,
let's talk about YouTube crowds. YouTube audiences,

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.810
that view count that you see at the bottom
of every video, and get some perspective on

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.480
it.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.080
We'll being with Dunbar's Number.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.520
It's an estimation of the maximum number of
people we can have stable, social relationships

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.360
with at a given moment
and it's based on the size of our neo-cortex.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.040
These aren't just acquaintances, these are
people you have social contact with - a network

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.960
where you know how everyone relates to everyone
else. And the number is usually given to be

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:10.880
somewhere between 100-230, which means that when
a YouTube video receives more than 230 views

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.700
from different people, more people have seen
that video than you could ever realistically

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.500
hope to know well, at a given moment.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.180
If a video has more than 100,000 views from
different people, more people have seen that

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:31.320
video than you will ever meet in your life.
And by meet, I mean shakes hands with, learn

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.060
their name, talk with them for a bit.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.640
I mean, think of it this way. You and me,
we're only statistically expected to live

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:47.060
around 28,470 days. So, even if you were to meet
someone, 2-3 people every day of your life,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.140
including when you were a baby, you still
wouldn't meet as many people as have seen

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.190
that YouTube video with 100,000 views.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.600
But keep this in mind. Even though you, or
even a large group of us, can't do much to

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.900
change Earth's location or rotation, we can
affect it a little bit. Newton's Third Law

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.420
guarantees this. If you weigh 150 pounds,
the Earth is pulling you down with a force

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:19.080
of 150 pounds. But you are also pulling up
on the Earth with a force of 150 pounds.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.640
If you fall 3 meters, the Earth has pulled
you down 3 meters. But you have also exerted

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.300
a equal and opposite force on the Earth.
Of course, it's a lot bigger. So, if you fall

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:35.480
3 meters, you pull the Earth up about a billionth
of the width of a proton, which ain't bad.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.920
So the next time you move your body, the next
time you jump, Felicia, think about this.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.320
You just affected the Earth as much as it
affected you. You've got that kind of power.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.140
Speaking of power, you all should go check
out "Geek &amp; Sundry", Felicia's new channel.

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.120
It's one of my new favorite things.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.340
And as always,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.340
thanks for watching.
